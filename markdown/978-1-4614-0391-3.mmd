## Preface

### Purpose

Our objective is to provide a postcalculus introduction to the discipline of statistics that

* Has mathematical integrity and contains some underlying theory.
* Shows students a broad range of applications involving real data.
* Is very current in its selection of topics.
* Illustrates the importance of statistical software.
* Is accessible to a wide audience, including mathematics and statistics majors (yes, there are a few of the latter), prospective engineers and scientists, and those business and social science majors interested in the quantitative aspects of their disciplines.

A number of currently available mathematical statistics texts are heavily oriented toward a rigorous mathematical development of probability and statistics, with much emphasis on theorems, proofs, and derivations. The focus is more on mathematics than on statistical practice. Even when applied material is included, the scenarios are often contrived (many examples and exercises involving dice, coins, cards, widgets, or a comparison of treatment A to treatment B).

So in our exposition we have tried to achieve a balance between mathematical foundations and statistical practice. Some may feel discomfort on grounds that because a mathematical statistics course has traditionally been a feeder into graduate programs in statistics, students coming out of such a course must be well prepared for that path. But that view presumes that the mathematics will provide the hook to get students interested in our discipline. This may happen for a few mathematics majors. However, our experience is that the application of statistics to real-world problems is far more persuasive in getting quantitatively oriented students to pursue a career or take further coursework in statistics. Let's first draw them in with intriguing problem scenarios and applications. Opportunities for exposing them to mathematical foundations will follow in due course. We believe it is more important for students coming out of this course to be able to carry out and interpret the results of a two-sample \(t\) test or simple regression analysis than to manipulate joint moment generating functions or discourse on various modes of convergence.

### Content

The book certainly does include core material in probability (Chapter 2), random variables and their distributions (Chapters 3-5), and sampling theory (Chapter 6). But our desire to balance theory with application/data analysis is reflected in the way the book starts out, with a chapter on descriptive and exploratory statisticaltechniques rather than an immediate foray into the axioms of probability and their consequences. After the distributional infrastructure is in place, the remaining statistical chapters cover the basics of inference. In addition to introducing core ideas from estimation and hypothesis testing (Chapters 7-10), there is emphasis on checking assumptions and examining the data prior to formal analysis. Modern topics such as bootstrapping, permutation tests, residual analysis, and logistic regression are included. Our treatment of regression, analysis of variance, and categorical data analysis (Chapters 11-13) is definitely more oriented to dealing with real data than with theoretical properties of models. We also show many examples of output from commonly used statistical software packages, something noticeably absent in most other books pitched at this audience and level.

### Mathematical Level

The challenge for students at this level should lie with mastery of statistical concepts as well as with mathematical wizardry. Consequently, the mathematical prerequisites and demands are reasonably modest. Mathematical sophistication and quantitative reasoning ability are, of course, crucial to the enterprise. Students with a solid grounding in univariate calculus and some exposure to multivariate calculus should feel comfortable with what we are asking of them. The several sections where matrix algebra appears (transformations in Chapter 5 and the matrix approach to regression in the last section of Chapter 12) can easily be deemphasized or skipped entirely.

Our goal is to redress the balance between mathematics and statistics by putting more emphasis on the latter. The concepts, arguments, and notation contained herein will certainly stretch the intellects of many students. And a solid mastery of the material will be required in order for them to solve many of the roughly 1,300 exercises included in the book. Proofs and derivations are included where appropriate, but we think it likely that obtaining a conceptual understanding of the statistical enterprise will be the major challenge for readers.

### Recommended Coverage

There should be more than enough material in our book for a year-long course. Those wanting to emphasize some of the more theoretical aspects of the subject (e.g., moment generating functions, conditional expectation, transformations, order statistics, sufficiency) should plan to spend correspondingly less time on inferential methodology in the latter part of the book. We have opted not to mark certain sections as optional, preferring instead to rely on the experience and tastes of individual instructors in deciding what should be presented. We would also like to think that students could be asked to read an occasional subsection or even section on their own and then work exercises to demonstrate understanding, so that not everything would need to be presented in class. Remember that there is never enough time in a course of any duration to teach students all that we'd like them to know!

### Acknowledgments

We gratefully acknowledge the plentiful feedback provided by reviewers and colleagues. A special salute goes to Bruce Trumbo for going way beyond his mandate in providing us an incredibly thoughtful review of 40+ pages containingmany wonderful ideas and pertinent criticisms. Our emphasis on real data would not have come to fruition without help from the many individuals who provided us with data in published sources or in personal communications. We very much appreciate the editorial and production services provided by the folks at Springer, in particular Marc Strauss, Kathryn Schell, and Felix Portnoy.

## Appendix A Final Thought

It is our hope that students completing a course taught from this book will feel as passionately about the subject of statistics as we still do after so many years in the profession. Only teachers can really appreciate how gratifying it is to hear from a student after he or she has completed a course that the experience had a positive impact and maybe even affected a career choice.

## Chapter Overview and Descriptive Statistics

### 1 Introduction

Statistical concepts and methods are not only useful but indeed often indispensable in understanding the world around us. They provide ways of gaining new insights into the behavior of many phenomena that you will encounter in your chosen field of specialization.

The discipline of statistics teaches us how to make intelligent judgments and informed decisions in the presence of uncertainty and variation. Without uncertainty or variation, there would be little need for statistical methods or statisticians. If the yield of a crop were the same in every field, if all individuals reacted the same way to a drug, if everyone gave the same response to an opinion survey, and so on, then a single observation would reveal all desired information.

An interesting example of variation arises in the course of performing emissions testing on motor vehicles. The expense and time requirements of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) preclude its widespread use in vehicle inspection programs. As a result, many agencies have developed less costly and quicker tests, which it is hoped replicate FTP results. According to the journal article "Motor Vehicle Emissions Variability" (_J. Air Waste Manage. Assoc._, 1996: 667-675), the acceptance of the FTP as a gold standard has led to the widespread belief that repeated measurements on the same vehicle would yield identical (or nearly identical) results. The authors of the article applied the FTP to seven vehicles characterized as "high emitters." Here are the results of four hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide tests on one such vehicle:

\[\begin{array}{lcccc}\hline\hline\text{HC (}g/\text{mile)}&13.8&18.3&32.2&32.5\\ \text{CO (}g/\text{mile)}&118&149&232&236\\ \hline\hline\end{array}\]The substantial variation in both the HC and CO measurements casts considerable doubt on conventional wisdom and makes it much more difficult to make precise assessments about emissions levels.

How can statistical techniques be used to gather information and draw conclusions? Suppose, for example, that a biochemist has developed a medication for relieving headaches. If this medication is given to different individuals, variation in conditions and in the people themselves will result in more substantial relief for some individuals than for others. Methods of statistical analysis could be used on data from such an experiment to determine on the average how much relief to expect.

Alternatively, suppose the biochemist has developed a headache medication in the belief that it will be superior to the currently best medication. A comparative experiment could be carried out to investigate this issue by giving the current medication to some headache sufferers and the new medication to others. This must be done with care test the wrong conclusion emerge. For example, perhaps really the two medications are equally effective. However, the new medication may be applied to people who have less severe headaches and have less stressful lives. The investigator would then likely observe a difference between the two medications attributable not to the medications themselves, but to a poor choice of test groups. Statistics offers not only methods for analyzing the results of experiments once they have been carried out but also suggestions for how experiments can be performed in an efficient manner to lessen the effects of variation and have a better chance of producing correct conclusions.

## 2 Populations and Samples

We are constantly exposed to collections of facts, or **data**, both in our professional capacities and in everyday activities. The discipline of statistics provides methods for organizing and summarizing data and for drawing conclusions based on information contained in the data.

An investigation will typically focus on a well-defined collection of objects constituting a **population** of interest. In one study, the population might consist of all gelatin capsules of a particular type produced during a specified period. Another investigation might involve the population consisting of all individuals who received a B.S. in mathematics during the most recent academic year. When desired information is available for all objects in the population, we have what is called a **census**. Constraints on time, money, and other scarce resources usually make a census impractical or infeasible. Instead, a subset of the population--a **sample**--is selected in some prescribed manner. Thus we might obtain a sample of pills from a particular production run as a basis for investigating whether pills are conforming to manufacturing specifications, or we might select a sample of last year's graduates to obtain feedback about the quality of the curriculum.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

standard deviations, and correlation coefficients. The wide availability of statistical computer software packages has made these tasks much easier to carry out than they used to be. Computers are much more efficient than human beings at calculation and the creation of pictures (once they have received appropriate instructions from the user!). This means that the investigator doesn't have to expend much effort on "grunt work" and will have more time to study the data and extract important messages. Throughout this book, we will present output from various packages such as MINITAB, SAS, and R.

Charity is a big business in the United States. The website charitynavigator. com gives information on roughly 5500 charitable organizations, and there are many smaller charities that fly below the navigator's radar screen. Some charities operate very efficiently, with fundraising and administrative expenses that are only a small percentage of total expenses, whereas others spend a high percentage of what they take in on such activities. Here is data on fundraising expenses as a percentage of total expenditures for a random sample of 60 charities:

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline
6.1 & 12.6 & 34.7 & 1.6 & 18.8 & 2.2 & 3.0 & 2.2 & 5.6 & 3.8 \\
2.2 & 3.1 & 1.3 & 1.1 & 14.1 & 4.0 & 21.0 & 6.1 & 1.3 & 20.4 \\
7.5 & 3.9 & 10.1 & 8.1 & 19.5 & 5.2 & 12.0 & 15.8 & 10.4 & 5.2 \\
6.4 & 10.8 & 83.1 & 3.6 & 6.2 & 6.3 & 16.3 & 12.7 & 1.3 & 0.8 \\
8.8 & 5.1 & 3.7 & 26.3 & 6.0 & 48.0 & 8.2 & 11.7 & 7.2 & 3.9 \\
15.3 & 16.6 & 8.8 & 12.0 & 4.7 & 14.7 & 6.4 & 17.0 & 2.5 & 16.2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Without any organization, it is difficult to get a sense of the data's most prominent features: what a typical (i.e., representative) value might be, whether values are highly concentrated about a typical value or quite dispersed, whether there are any gaps in the data, what fraction of the values are less than 20%, and so on. Figure 1 shows a _histogram_. In Section 2 we will discuss construction and interpretation of this graph. For the moment, we hope you see how it describes the

Figure 1: A MINITAB histogram for the charity fundraising % data

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

from the population are posed and answered. In a statistics problem, characteristics of a sample are available to the experimenter, and this information enables the experimenter to draw conclusions about the population. The relationship between the two disciplines can be summarized by saying that probability reasons from the population to the sample (deductive reasoning), whereas inferential statistics reasons from the sample to the population (inductive reasoning). This is illustrated in Figure 2.

Before we can understand what a particular sample can tell us about the population, we should first understand the uncertainty associated with taking a sample from a given population. This is why we study probability before statistics.

As an example of the contrasting focus of probability and inferential statistics, consider drivers' use of manual lap belts in cars equipped with automatic shoulder belt systems. (The article "Automobile Seat Belts: Usage Patterns in Automatic Belt Systems," _Hum. Factors_, 1998: 126-135, summarizes usage data.) In probability, we might assume that 50% of all drivers of cars equipped in this way in a certain metropolitan area regularly use their lap belt (an assumption about the population), so we might ask, "How likely is it that a sample of 100 such drivers will include at least 70 who regularly use their lap belt?" or "How many of the drivers in a sample of size 100 can we expect to regularly use their lap belt?" On the other hand, in inferential statistics we have sample information available; for example, a sample of 100 drivers of such cars revealed that 65 regularly use their lap belt. We might then ask, "Does this provide substantial evidence for concluding that more than 50% of all such drivers in this area regularly use their lap belt?" In this latter scenario, we are attempting to use sample information to answer a question about the structure of the entire population from which the sample was selected.

Suppose, though, that a study involving a sample of 25 patients is carried out to investigate the efficacy of a new minimally invasive method for rotator cuff surgery. The amount of time that each individual subsequently spends in physical therapy is then determined. The resulting sample of 25 PT times is from a population that does not actually exist. Instead it is convenient to think of the population as consisting of all possible times that might be observed under similar experimental conditions. Such a population is referred to as a conceptual or hypothetical population. There are a number of problem situations in which we fit questions into the framework of inferential statistics by conceptualizing a population.

Sometimes an investigator must be very cautious about generalizing from the circumstances under which data has been gathered. For example, a sample of five engines with a new design may be experimentally manufactured and tested to investigate efficiency. These five could be viewed as a sample from the conceptual population of all prototypes that could be manufactured under similar conditions, but _not_ necessarily as representative of the population of units manufactured once regular production gets under way. Methods for using sample information to draw

Figure 2: The relationship between probability and inferential statistics

conclusions about future production units may be problematic. Similarly, a new drug may be tried on patients who arrive at a clinic, but there may be some question about how typical these patients are. They may not be representative of patients elsewhere or patients at the clinic next year. A good exposition of these issues is contained in the article "Assumptions for Statistical Inference" by Gerald Hahn and William Meeker (_Amer. Statist._, 1993: 1-11).

## Collecting Data

Statistics deals not only with the organization and analysis of data once it has been collected but also with the development of techniques for collecting the data. If data is not properly collected, an investigator may not be able to answer the questions under consideration with a reasonable degree of confidence. One common problem is that the target population--the one about which conclusions are to be drawn--may be different from the population actually sampled. For example, advertisers would like various kinds of information about the television-viewing habits of potential customers. The most systematic information of this sort comes from placing monitoring devices in a small number of homes across the United States. It has been conjectured that placement of such devices in and of itself alters viewing behavior, so that characteristics of the sample may be different from those of the target population.

When data collection entails selecting individuals or objects from a list, the simplest method for ensuring a representative selection is to take a _simple random sample_. This is one for which any particular subset of the specified size (e.g., a sample of size 100) has the same chance of being selected. For example, if the list consists of 1,000,000 serial numbers, the numbers 1, 2,..., up to 1,000,000 could be placed on identical slips of paper. After placing these slips in a box and thoroughly mixing, slips could be drawn one by one until the requisite sample size has been obtained. Alternatively (and much to be preferred), a table of random numbers or a computer's random number generator could be employed.

Sometimes alternative sampling methods can be used to make the selection process easier, to obtain extra information, or to increase the degree of confidence in conclusions. One such method, _stratified sampling_, entails separating the population units into nonoverlapping groups and taking a sample from each one. For example, a manufacturer of DVD players might want information about customer satisfaction for units produced during the previous year. If three different models were manufactured and sold, a separate sample could be selected from each of the three corresponding strata. This would result in information on all three models and ensure that no one model was over- or underrepresented in the entire sample.

Frequently a "convenience" sample is obtained by selecting individuals or objects without systematic randomization. As an example, a collection of bricks may be stacked in such a way that it is extremely difficult for those in the center to be selected. If the bricks on the top and sides of the stack were somehow different from the others, resulting sample data would not be representative of the population. Often an investigator will assume that such a convenience sample approximates a random sample, in which case a statistician's repertoire of inferential methods can be used; however, this is a judgment call. Most of the methods discussed herein are based on a variation of simple random sampling described in Chapter 6.

Researchers often collect data by carrying out some sort of designed experiment. This may involve deciding how to allocate several different treatments (such as fertilizers or drugs) to the various experimental units (plots of land or patients). Alternatively, an investigator may systematically vary the levels or categories of certain factors (e.g., amount of fertilizer or dose of a drug) and observe the effect on some response variable (such as corn yield or blood pressure).

An article in the _New York Times_ (January 27, 1987) reported that heart attack risk could be reduced by taking aspirin. This conclusion was based on a designed experiment involving both a control group of individuals, who took a placebo having the appearance of aspirin but known to be inert, and a treatment group who took aspirin according to a specified regimen. Subjects were randomly assigned to the groups to protect against any biases and so that probability-based methods could be used to analyze the data. Of the 11,034 individuals in the control group, 189 subsequently experienced heart attacks, whereas only 104 of the 11,037 in the aspirin group had a heart attack. The incidence rate of heart attacks in the treatment group was only about half that in the control group. One possible explanation for this result is chance variation, that aspirin really doesn't have the desired effect and the observed difference is just typical variation in the same way that tossing two identical coins would usually produce different numbers of heads. However, in this case, inferential methods suggest that chance variation by itself cannot adequately explain the magnitude of the observed difference. 

## 1.1.

1. Give one possible sample of size 4 from each of the following populations: 1. All daily newspapers published in the United States 2. All companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange 3. All students at your college or university 4. All grade point averages of students at your college or university
2. For each of the following hypothetical populations, give a plausible sample of size 4: 1. All distances that might result when you throw a football 2. Page lengths of books published 5 years from now 3. All possible earthquake-strength measurements (Richter scale) that might be recorded in California during the next year 4. All possible yields (in grams) from a certain chemical reaction carried out in a laboratory
3. Consider the population consisting of all DVD players of a certain brand and model, and focus on whether a DVD player needs service while under warranty. 1. Pose several probability questions based on selecting a sample of 100 such DVD players. 2. What inferential statistics question might be answered by determining the number of such DVD players in a sample of size 100 that need warranty service?
4. Give three different examples of concrete populations and three different examples of hypothetical populations. 2. For one each of your concrete and your hypothetical populations, give an example of a probability question and an example of an inferential statistics question.
5. Many universities and colleges have instituted supplemental instruction (SI) programs, in which a student facilitator meets regularly with a small group of students enrolled in the course to promote discussion of course material and enhance subject mastery. Suppose that students in a large statistics course (what else?) are randomly divided into a control group that will not participate in SI and a treatment group that will participate. At the end of the term, each student's total score in the course is determined.

* Are the scores from the SI group a sample from an existing population? If so, what is it? If not, what is the relevant conceptual population?
* What do you think is the advantage of randomly dividing the students into the two groups rather than letting each student choose which group to join?
* Why didn't the investigators put all students in the treatment group? [_Note_: The article "Supplemental Instruction: An Effective Component of Student Affairs Programming" _J. Coll. Stud. Dev._, 1997: 577-586 discusses the analysis of data from several SI programs.]
* The California State University (CSU) system consists of 23 campuses, from San Diego State in the south to Humboldt State near the Oregon border. A CSU administrator wishes to make an inference about the average distance between the hometowns of students and their campuses. Describe and discuss several different sampling methods that might be employed.
* A certain city divides naturally into ten district neighborhoods. A real estate appraiser would like to develop an equation to predict appraised value from characteristics such as age, size, number of bathrooms, distance to the nearest school, and so on. How might she select a sample of single-family homes that could be used as a basis for this analysis?
* The amount of flow through a solenoid valve in an automobile's pollution-control system is an important characteristic. An experiment was carried out to study how flow rate depended on three factors: armature length, spring load, and bobbin depth. Two different levels (low and high) of each factor were chosen, and a single observation on flow was made for each combination of levels.
* The resulting data set consisted of how many observations?
* Does this study involve sampling an existing population or a conceptual population?
* In a famous experiment carried out in 1882, Michelson and Newcomb obtained 66 observations on the time it took for light to travel between two locations in Washington, D.C. A few of the measurements (coded in a certain manner) were 31, 23, 32, 36, 22, 26, 27, and 31.
* Why are these measurements not identical?
* Does this study involve sampling an existing population or a conceptual population?

## 1.2 Pictorial and Tabular Methods

in Descriptive Statistics

There are two general types of methods within descriptive statistics. In this section we will discuss the first of these types--representing a data set using visual techniques. In Sections 1.3 and 1.4, we will develop some numerical summary measures for data sets. Many visual techniques may already be familiar to you: frequency tables, tally sheets, histograms, pie charts, bar graphs, scatter diagrams, and the like. Here we focus on a selected few of these techniques that are most useful and relevant to probability and inferential statistics.

### Notation

Some general notation will make it easier to apply our methods and formulas to a wide variety of practical problems. The number of observations in a single sample, that is, the sample size, will often be denoted by \(n\), so that \(n=4\) for the sample of universities {Stanford, Iowa State, Wyoming, Rochester} and also for the sample of pH measurements {6.3, 6.2, 5.9, 6.5}. If two samples are simultaneously under consideration, either \(m\) and \(n\) or \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\) can be used to denote the numbers of observations. Thus if {3.75, 2.60, 3.20, 3.79} and {2.75, 1.20, 2.45} are grade point averages for students on a mathematics floor and the rest of the dorm, respectively, then \(m=4\) and \(n=3\).

Given a data set consisting of \(n\) observations on some variable \(x\), the individual observations will be denoted by \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(x_{3}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\). The subscript bears no relation to the magnitude of a particular observation. Thus \(x_{1}\) will not in general be the smallest observation in the set, nor will \(x_{n}\) typically be the largest. In many applications, \(x_{1}\) will be the first observation gathered by the experimenter, \(x_{2}\) the second, and so on. The \(i\)th observation in the data set will be denoted by \(x_{i}\).

### Stem-and-Leaf Displays

Consider a numerical data set \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) for which each \(x_{i}\) consists of at least two digits. A quick way to obtain an informative visual representation of the data set is to construct a _stem-and-leaf display_.

* Select one or more leading digits for the stem values. The trailing digits become the leaves.
* List possible stem values in a vertical column.
* Record the leaf for every observation beside the corresponding stem value.
* Order the leaves from smallest to largest on each line.
* Indicate the units for stems and leaves someplace in the display.

If the data set consists of exam scores, each between 0 and 100, the score of 83 would have a stem of 8 and a leaf of 3. For a data set of automobile fuel efficiencies (mpg), all between 8.1 and 47.8, we could use the tens digit as the stem, so 32.6 would then have a leaf of 2.6. Usually, a display based on between 5 and 20 stems is appropriate.

For a simple example, assume a sample of seven test scores: 93, 84, 86, 78, 95, 81, 72. Then the first pass stem plot would be

\[\begin{array}{l}7\mbox{l82}\\ 8\mbox{l461}\\ 9\mbox{l35}\end{array}\]

With the leaves ordered this becomes

\[\begin{array}{l}7\mbox{l28}\\ 8\mbox{l146}\\ 9\mbox{l35}\end{array}\]

The use of alcohol by college students is of great concern not only to those in the academic community but also, because of potential health and safety consequences, to society at large. The article "Health and Behavioral Consequences of Binge Drinking in College" (_J. Amer. Med. Assoc._, 1994: 1672-1677) reported on a comprehensive study of heavy drinking on campuses across the United States. A binge episode was defined as five or more drinks in a row for males and four or more for females. Figure 3 shows a stem-and-leaf display of 140 values of \(x=\) the percentage of undergraduate students who are binge drinkers. (These values were not given in the cited article, but our display agrees with a picture of the data that did appear.)

The first leaf on the stem 2 row is 1, which tells us that 21% of the students at one of the colleges in the sample were binge drinkers. Without the identification of stem digits and leaf digits on the display, we wouldn't know whether the stem 2, leaf 1 observation should be read as 21%, 2.1%, or.21%.

The display suggests that a typical or representative value is in the stem 4 row, perhaps in the mid-40% range. The observations are not highly concentrated about this typical value, as would be the case if all values were between 20% and 49%. The display rises to a single peak as we move downward, and then declines; there are no gaps in the display. The shape of the display is not perfectly symmetric, but instead appears to stretch out a bit more in the direction of low leaves than in the direction of high leaves. Lastly, there are no observations that are unusually far from the bulk of the data (no _outliers_), as would be the case if one of the 26% values had instead been 86%. The most surprising feature of this data is that, at most colleges in the sample, at least one-quarter of the students are binge drinkers. The problem of heavy drinking on campuses is much more pervasive than many had suspected. 

A stem-and-leaf display conveys information about the following aspects of the data:

* Identification of a typical or representative value
* Extent of spread about the typical value
* Presence of any gaps in the data
* Extent of symmetry in the distribution of values
* Number and location of peaks
* Presence of any outlying values

Figure 4 presents stem-and-leaf displays for a random sample of lengths of golf courses (yards) that have been designated by _Golf Magazine_ as among the most challenging in the United States. Among the sample of 40 courses, the shortest is 6433 yards long, and the longest is 7280 yards. The lengths appear to be distributed in a roughly uniform fashion over the range of values in the sample. Notice that a stem choice here of either a single digit (6 or 7) or three digits (643,..., 728) would yield an uninformative display, the first because of too few stems and the latter because of too many.

### Dotplots

A dotplot is an attractive summary of numerical data when the data set is reasonably small or there are relatively few distinct data values. Each observation is represented by a dot above the corresponding location on a horizontal measurement scale. When a value occurs more than once, there is a dot for each occurrence, and these dots are stacked vertically. As with a stem-and-leaf display, a dotplot gives information about location, spread, extremes, and gaps.

Figure 5 shows a dotplot for the first grade IQ data introduced in Example 2 in the previous section. A representative IQ value is around 110, and the data is fairly symmetric about the center.

If the data set discussed in Example 2 had consisted of the IQ average from each of 100 classes, each recorded to the nearest tenth, it would have been much more cumbersome to construct a dotplot. Our next technique is well suited to such situations.

It should be mentioned that for some software packages (including R) the dot plot is entirely different.

### Histograms

Some numerical data is obtained by counting to determine the value of a variable (the number of traffic citations a person received during the last year, the number of persons arriving for service during a particular period), whereas other data is

Figure 4: Stem-and-leaf displays of golf course yardages: (a) two-digit leaves; (b) display from MINITAB with truncated one-digit leavesobtained by taking measurements (weight of an individual, reaction time to a particular stimulus). The prescription for drawing a histogram is generally different for these two cases.

Consider first data resulting from observations on a "counting variable" \(x\). The **frequency** of any particular \(x\) value is the number of times that value occurs in the data set. The **relative frequency** of a value is the fraction or proportion of times the value occurs:

\[\text{relative frequency of a value}=\frac{\text{number of times the value occurs}}{\text{number of observations in the dataset}}\]

Suppose, for example, that our data set consists of 200 observations on \(x=\) the number of major defects in a new car of a certain type. If 70 of these \(x\) values are 1, then

\[\text{frequency of the $x$ value }1:70\] \[\text{relative frequency of the $x$ value }1:\frac{70}{200}=.35\]

Multiplying a relative frequency by 100 gives a percentage; in the defect example, 35% of the cars in the sample had just one major defect. The relative frequencies, or percentages, are usually of more interest than the frequencies themselves. In theory, the relative frequencies should sum to 1, but in practice the sum may differ slightly from 1 because of rounding. A **frequency distribution** is a tabulation of the frequencies and/or relative frequencies.

\[\text{A HISTO-GRAM FOR COUNTING DATA}\]

First, determine the frequency and relative frequency of each \(x\) value. Then mark possible \(x\) values on a horizontal scale. Above each value, draw a rectangle whose height is the relative frequency (or alternatively, the frequency) of that value.

This construction ensures that the _area_ of each rectangle is proportional to the relative frequency of the value. Thus if the relative frequencies of \(x=1\) and \(x=5\) are.35 and.07, respectively, then the area of the rectangle above 1 is five times the area of the rectangle above 5.

How unusual is a no-hitter or a one-hitter in a major league baseball game, and how frequently does a team get more than 10, 15, or even 20 hits? Table 1 is a frequency distribution for the number of hits per team per game for all nine-inning games that were played between 1989 and 1993. Notice that a no-hitter happens only about once in a 1000 games, and 22 or more hits occurs with about the same frequency.

The corresponding histogram in Figure 1.6 rises rather smoothly to a single peak and then declines. The histogram extends a bit more on the right (toward large values) than it does on the left, a slight "positive skew."Either from the tabulated information or from the histogram itself, we can determine the following:

\[\begin{array}{lclcl}\text{proportion of games with}&\text{relative}&\text{relative}& \text{relative}\\ \text{at most two hits}&=&\text{frequency}&+&\text{frequency}&+&\text{frequency}\\ &\text{for}\,x\,{=}\,0&\text{for}\,x\,{=}\,1&\text{for}\,x\,{=}\,2\\ &=&.0010&+&.0037&+&.0108&=.0155\end{array}\]

Similarly,

\[\begin{array}{lcl}\text{proportion of games with}&\\ \text{between 5 and 10 hits}&(\text{inclusive})&=.0752+.1026+\cdots+.1015=.6361\end{array}\]

That is, roughly 64% of all these games resulted in between 5 and 10 (inclusive) hits.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline  & **Number** & **Relative** & & **Number** & **Relative** \\

Constructing a histogram for measurement data (observations on a "measurement variable") entails subdividing the measurement axis into a suitable number of **class intervals** or **classes**, such that each observation is contained in exactly one class. Suppose, for example, that we have 50 observations on \(x=\) fuel efficiency of an automobile (mpg), the smallest of which is 27.8 and the largest of which is 31.4. Then we could use the class boundaries 27.5, 28.0, 28.5,..., and 31.5 as shown here:

One potential difficulty is that occasionally an observation falls on a class boundary and therefore does not lie in exactly one interval, for example, 29.0. One way to deal with this problem is to use boundaries like 27.55, 28.05,..., 31.55. Adding a hundredths digit to the class boundaries prevents observations from falling on the resulting boundaries. The approach that we will follow is to write the class intervals as 27.5-28, 28-28.5, and so on and use the convention that _any observation falling on a class boundary will be included in the class to the right of the observation_. Thus 29.0 would go in the 29-29.5 class rather than the 28.5-29 class. This is how MINITAB constructs a histogram. However, the default histogram in R does it the other way, with 29.0 going into the 28.5-29.0 class.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{A HISTO-GRAM FOR MEASURE-MENT DATA: EQUAL CLASS}&\mbox{Determine the frequency and relative frequency for each class. Mark the class boundaries on a horizontal measurement axis. Above each class interval, draw a rectangle whose height is the corresponding relative frequency (or frequency).}\\ \hline\mbox{Example 1.6}&\mbox{Power companies need information about customer usage to obtain accurate forecasts of demands. Investigators from Wisconsin Power and Light determined energy consumption (BTUs) during a particular period for a sample of 90 gasketed homes. An adjusted consumption value was calculated as follows:

\[\mbox{adjusted consumption }=\frac{\mbox{consumption}}{\mbox{(weather in degree days)(house area)}}\]

This resulted in the accompanying data (part of the stored data set FURNACE. MTW available in MINITAB), which we have ordered from smallest to largest.

We let MINITAB select the class intervals. The most striking feature of the histogram in Figure 7 is its resemblance to a bell-shaped (and therefore symmetric) curve, with the point of symmetry roughly at 10.

From the histogram,

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{proportion of}\\ \mbox{observations}\quad\approx.01+.01+.12+.23=.37\quad\left(\mbox{exact value}=\frac{34}{90}=.378\right)\\ \mbox{less than 9}\end{array}\]

The relative frequency for the 9-11 class is about.27, so we estimate that roughly half of this, or.135, is between 9 and 10. Thus

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{proportion of observations}\\ \mbox{less than 10}\quad\approx.37+.135=.505\quad\left(\mbox{slightly more than 50\%}\right)\\ \mbox{The exact value of this proportion is 47/90}=.522.\end{array}\]

There are no hard-and-fast rules concerning either the number of classes or the choice of classes themselves. Between 5 and 20 classes will be satisfactory for most data sets. Generally, the larger the number of observations in a data set, the more classes should be used. A reasonable rule of thumb is

\[\mbox{number of classes }\approx\sqrt{\mbox{number of observations}}\]

Equal-width classes may not be a sensible choice if a data set "stretches out" to one side or the other. Figure 8 shows a dotplot of such a data set. Using a small number of equal-width classes results in almost all observations falling in just

Figure 7: Histogram of the energy consumption data from Example 8

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11290]

This histogram has three rather distinct peaks: the first corresponding to lightweight players like defensive backs and wide receivers, the second to "medium weight" players like linebackers, and the third to the heavyweights who play offensive or defensive line positions. \(\blacksquare\)

When class widths are unequal, not using a density scale will give a picture with distorted areas. For equal-class widths, the divisor is the same in each density calculation, and the extra arithmetic simply results in a rescaling of the vertical axis (i.e., the histogram using relative frequency and the one using density will have exactly the same appearance). A density histogram does have one interesting property. Multiplying both sides of the formula for density by the class width gives

\[\text{relative frequency }=(\text{class width})(\text{density}) =(\text{rectangle width})(\text{rectangle height})\] \[=\text{rectangle area}\]

That is, _the area of each rectangle is the relative frequency of the corresponding class_. Furthermore, because the sum of relative frequencies must be 1.0 (except for roundoff), _the total area of all rectangles in a density histogram is_ l. It is always possible to draw a histogram so that the area equals the relative frequency (this is true also for a histogram of counting data)--just use the density scale. This property will play an important role in creating models for distributions in Chapter 4.

## 10 Histogram Shapes

Histograms come in a variety of shapes. A **unimodal** histogram is one that rises to a single peak and then declines. A **bimodal** histogram has two different peaks. Bimodality can occur when the data set consists of observations on two quite different kinds of individuals or objects. For example, consider a large data set

Figure 9: A MINITAB density histogram for the weight data of Example 9

consisting of driving times for automobiles traveling between San Luis Obispo and Monterey in California (exclusive of stopping time for sightseeing, eating, etc.). This histogram would show two peaks, one for those cars that took the inland route (roughly 2.5 h) and another for those cars traveling up the coast (3.5-4 h). However, bimodality does not automatically follow in such situations. Only if the two separate histograms are "far apart" relative to their spreads will bimodality occur in the histogram of combined data. Thus a large data set consisting of heights of college students should not result in a bimodal histogram because the typical male height of about 69 in. is not far enough above the typical female height of about 64-65 in. A histogram with more than two peaks is said to be **multimodal**.

A histogram is **symmetric** if the left half is a mirror image of the right half. A unimodal histogram is **positively skewed** if the right or upper tail is stretched out compared with the left or lower tail and **negatively skewed** if the stretching is to the left. Figure 10 shows "smoothed" histograms, obtained by superimposing a smooth curve on the rectangles, that illustrate the various possibilities.

### Qualitative Data

Both a frequency distribution and a histogram can be constructed when the data set is qualitative (categorical) in nature; in this case, "bar graph" is synonymous with "histogram." Sometimes there will be a natural ordering of classes (for example, freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, graduate students) whereas in other cases the order will be arbitrary (for example, Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and the like). With such categorical data, the intervals above which rectangles are constructed should have equal width.

Each member of a sample of 120 individuals owning motorcycles was asked for the name of the manufacturer of his or her bike. The frequency distribution for the resulting data is given in Table 2 and the histogram is shown in Figure 11.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline
**Manufacturer** & **Frequency** & **Relative frequency** \\ \hline
1. Honda & 41 &.34 \\
2. Yamaha & 27 &.23 \\
3. Kawasaki & 20 &.17 \\
4. Harley-Davidson & 18 &.15 \\
5. BMW & 3 &.03 \\
6. Other & 11 &.09 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The number of cycles of strain to breakage was determined for each yarn specimen, resulting in the following data: \[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrrrr}86&146&251&653&98&249&400&292&131&169\\ 175&176&76&264&15&364&195&262&88&264\\ 157&220&42&321&180&198&38&20&61&121\\ 282&224&149&180&325&250&196&90&229&166\\ 38&337&65&151&341&40&40&135&597&246\\ 211&180&93&315&353&571&124&279&81&186\\ 497&182&423&185&229&400&338&290&398&71\\ 246&185&188&568&55&55&61&244&20&284\\ 393&396&203&829&239&236&286&194&277&143\\ 198&264&105&203&124&137&135&350&193&188\\ \end{array}\] 1.

23. A transformation of data values by means of some mathematical function, such as \(\sqrt{x}\) or 1/\(x\), can often yield a set of numbers that has "nicer" statistical properties than the original data. In particular, it may be possible to find a function for which the histogram of transformed values is more symmetric (or, even better, more like a bell-shaped curve) than the original data. As an example, the article "Time Lapse Cinematographic Analysis of Beryllium-Lung Fibroblast Interactions" (_Environ. Res._, 1983: 34-43) reported the results of experiments designed to study the behavior of certain individual cells that had been exposed to beryllium. An important characteristic of such an individual cell is its interdivision time (IDT). IDTs were determined for a large number of cells both in exposed (treatment) and unexposed (control) conditions. The authors of the article used a logarithmic transformation, that is, transformed value \(=\log_{10}\)(original value). Consider the following representative IDT data: \[\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}28.1&31.2&13.7&46.0&25.8&16.8&34.8\\ 62.3&28.0&17.9&19.5&21.1&31.9&28.9\\ 60.1&23.7&18.6&21.4&26.6&26.2&32.0\\ 43.5&17.4&38.8&30.6&55.6&25.5&52.1\\ 21.0&22.3&15.5&36.3&19.1&38.4&72.8\\ 48.9&21.4&20.7&57.3&40.9&\end{array}\] Use class intervals 10-20, 20-30,... to construct a histogram of the original data. Use intervals 1.1-1.2, 1.2-1.3,... to do the same for the transformed data. What is the effect of the transformation? 24. Unlike most packaged food products, alcohol beverage container labels are not required to show calorie or nutrient content. The article "What Am I Drinking? The Effects of Serving Facts Information on Alcohol Beverage Containers" (_J. of Consumer Affairs_, 2008: 81-99) reported on a pilot study in which each individual in a sample was asked to estimate the calorie content of a 12 oz can of light beer known to contain 103 cal. The following information appeared in the article: \[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}\hline\hline\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span \omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span \omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span \omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit \span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span \omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span \omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit\span\omit \span\omit\span\25. The article "Study on the Life Distribution of Microdrills" (\(J\). _Engrg.

Obtain frequencies and relative frequencies for the various categories, and draw a histogram.

27. A Pareto diagram is a variation of a histogram for categorical data resulting from a quality control study. Each category represents a different type of product nonconformity or production problem. The categories are ordered so that the one with the largest frequency appears on the far left, then the category with the second largest frequency, and so on. Suppose the following information on nonconformities in circuit packs is obtained: failed component, 126; incorrect component, 210; insufficient solder, 67; excess solder, 54; missing component, 131. Construct a Pareto diagram.
28. The **cumulative frequency** and **cumulative relative frequency** for a particular class interval are the sum of frequencies and relative frequencies, respectively, for that interval and all intervals lying below it. If, for example, there are four intervals with frequencies 9, 16, 13, and 12, then the cumulative frequencies are 9, 25, 38, and 50, and the cumulative relative frequencies are.18,.50,.76, and 1.00.

What proportion of the loads are between 600 and 1200?

## 1.3 Measures of Location

Visual summaries of data are excellent tools for obtaining preliminary impressions and insights. More formal data analysis often requires the calculation and interpretation of numerical summary measures. That is, from the data we try to extract several summarizing numbers--numbers that might serve to characterize the data set and convey some of its most important features. Our primary concern will be with numerical data; some comments regarding categorical data appear at the end of the section.

Suppose, then, that our data set is of the form \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n}\), where each \(x_{i}\) is a number. What features of such a set of numbers are of most interest and deserve emphasis? One important characteristic of a set of numbers is its location, and in particular its center. This section presents methods for describing the location of a data set; in Section 1.4 we will turn to methods for measuring variability in a set of numbers.

### The Mean

For a given set of numbers \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n}\), the most familiar and useful measure of the center is the _mean_, or arithmetic average of the set. Because we will almost always think of the \(x_{i}\)'s as constituting a sample, we will often refer to the arithmetic average as the _sample mean_ and denote it by \(\bar{x}\).

#### Definition

The **sample mean**\(\bar{x}\) of observations \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n}\) is given by

\[\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}\]

The numerator of \(\bar{x}\) can be written more informally as \(\sum x_{i}\) where the summation is over all sample observations.

For reporting \(\bar{x}\), we recommend using decimal accuracy of one digit more than the accuracy of the \(x_{i}\)'s. Thus if observations are stopping distances with \(x_{1}=125\), \(x_{2}=131\), and so on, we might have \(\bar{x}=127.3\) ft.

A class was assigned to make wingspan measurements at home. The wingspan is the horizontal measurement from fingertip to fingertip with outstretched arms. Here are the measurements given by 21 of the students.

\(x_{1}=60\)\(x_{2}=64\)\(x_{3}=72\)\(x_{4}=63\)\(x_{5}=66\)\(x_{6}=62\)\(x_{7}=75\)\(x_{8}=66\)\(x_{9}=59\)\(x_{10}=75\)\(x_{11}=69\)\(x_{12}=62\)\(x_{13}=63\)\(x_{14}=61\)\(x_{15}=65\)\(x_{16}=67\)\(x_{17}=65\)\(x_{18}=69\)\(x_{19}=95\)\(x_{20}=60\)\(x_{21}=70\)Figure 1.12 shows a stem-and-leaf display of the data; a wingspan in the 60's appears to be "typical."

Figure 1.12: A stem-and-leaf display of the wingspan data

With \(\sum x_{i}=1408\), the sample mean is

\[\bar{x}=\frac{1408}{21}=67.0\]

a value consistent with information conveyed by the stem-and-leaf display. \(\blacksquare\)

A physical interpretation of \(\bar{x}\) demonstrates how it measures the location (center) of a sample. Think of drawing and scaling a horizontal measurement axis, and then representing each sample observation by a 1-lb weight placed at the corresponding point on the axis. The only point at which a fulcrum can be placed to balance the system of weights is the point corresponding to the value of \(\bar{x}\) (see Figure 13). The system balances because, as shown in the next section, \(\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)=0\) so the net total tendency to turn about \(\bar{x}\) is 0.

Just as \(\bar{x}\) represents the average value of the observations in a sample, the average of all values in the population can in principle be calculated. This average is called the **population mean** and is denoted by the Greek letter \(\mu\). When there are \(N\) values in the population (a finite population), then \(\mu=\) (sum of the \(N\) population values)/\(N\). In Chapters 3 and 4, we will give a more general definition for \(\mu\) that applies to both finite and (conceptually) infinite populations. Just as \(\bar{x}\) is an interesting and important measure of sample location, \(\mu\) is an interesting and important (often the most important) characteristic of a population. In the chapters on statistical inference, we will present methods based on the sample mean for drawing conclusions about a population mean. For example, we might use the sample mean \(\bar{x}=67.0\) computed in Example 11 as a _point estimate_ (a single number that is our "best" guess) of \(\mu=\) the true average wingspan for all students in introductory statistics classes.

The mean suffers from one deficiency that makes it an inappropriate measure of center under some circumstances: its value can be greatly affected by the presence of even a single outlier (unusually large or small observation). In Example 11, the value \(x_{19}=95\) is obviously an outlier. Without this observation, \(\bar{x}=1313/20=65.7\); the outlier increases the mean by 1.3 in. The value 95 is clearly an error--this student is only 70 in. tall, and there is no way such a student could have a wingspan of almost 8 ft. As Leonardo da Vinci noticed, wingspan is usually quite close to height.

Data on housing prices in various metropolitan areas often contains outliers (those lucky enough to live in palatial accommodations), in which case the use of average price as a measure of center will typically be misleading. We will momentarily propose an alternative to the mean, namely the median, that is insensitive to outliers (recent New York City data gave a median price of less than $700,000 and a mean price exceeding $1,000,000). However, the mean is still by far the most

Figure 13: The mean as the balance point for a system of weights

widely used measure of center, largely because there are many populations for which outliers are very scarce. When sampling from such a population (a normal or bell-shaped distribution being the most important example), outliers are highly unlikely to enter the sample. The sample mean will then tend to be stable and quite representative of the sample.

### The Median

The word _median_ is synonymous with "middle," and the sample median is indeed the middle value when the observations are ordered from smallest to largest. When the observations are denoted by \(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\), we will use the symbol \(\tilde{x}\) to represent the sample median.

\begin{tabular}{p{284.5pt}} \hline \hline The **sample median** is obtained by first ordering the \(n\) observations from smallest to largest (with any repeated values included so that every sample observation appears in the ordered list). Then, \\ \(\tilde{x}=\left\{\begin{array}{l}\text{The single}\\ \text{middle value if $n$}\\ \text{is odd}\\ \text{The average}\\ \text{of the two}\\ \text{middle}\\ \text{values if $n$}\\ \text{is even}\\ \end{array}\right.\) = average of \(\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{\text{th}}\)and \(\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)^{\text{th}}\)ordered values \\ \end{tabular}

People not familiar with classical music might tend to believe that a composer's instructions for playing a particular piece are so specific that the duration would not depend at all on the performer(s). However, there is typically plenty of room for interpretation, and orchestral conductors and musicians take full advantage of this. We went to the website ArkivMusic.com and selected a sample of 12 recordings of Beethoven's Symphony #9 (the "Choral", a stunningly beautiful work), yielding the following durations (min) listed in increasing order:

\[62.3\quad 62.8\quad 63.6\quad 65.2\quad 65.7\quad 66.4\quad 67.4\quad 68.4\quad 68.8\quad 70.8\quad 75.7\quad 79.0\]

Since \(n=12\) is even, the sample median is the average of the \(n/2=6\)th and (\(n/2+1)=7\)th values from the ordered list:

\[\tilde{x}\quad=\quad\frac{66.4+67.4}{2}\quad=\quad 66.90\]Note that if the largest observation 79.0 had not been included in the sample, the resulting sample median for the \(n=11\) remaining observations would have been the single middle value 67.4 (the [\(n+1\)]/\(2=6\)th ordered value, i.e., the 6th value in from either end of the ordered list). The sample mean is \(\bar{x}=\sum x_{i}/n=816.1/12=68.01\), a bit more than a full minute larger than the median. The mean is pulled out a bit relative to the median because the sample "stretches out" somewhat more on the upper end than on the lower end. 

The data in Example 1.12 illustrates an important property of \(\bar{x}\) in contrast to \(\bar{x}\). The sample median is very insensitive to a number of extremely small or extremely large data values. If, for example, we increased the two largest \(x_{i}\)'s from 75.7 and 79.0 to 95.7 and 99.0, respectively, \(\bar{x}\) would be unaffected. Thus, in the treatment of outlying data values, \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{x}\) are at opposite ends of a spectrum: \(\bar{x}\) is sensitive to even one such value, whereas \(\bar{x}\) is insensitive to a large number of outlying values.

Because the large values in the sample of Example 1.12 affect \(\bar{x}\) more than \(\bar{x}\), \(\bar{x}<\bar{x}\) for that data. Although \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{x}\) both provide a measure for the center of a data set, they will not in general be equal because they focus on different aspects of the sample.

Analogous to \(\bar{x}\) as the middle value in the sample is a middle value in the population, the **population median**, denoted by \(\bar{\mu}\). As with \(\bar{x}\) and \(\mu\), we can think of using the sample median \(\bar{x}\) to make an inference about \(\bar{\mu}\). In Example 1.12, we might use \(\bar{x}=66.90\) as an estimate of the median duration in the entire population from which the sample was selected. A median is often used to describe income or salary data (because it is not greatly influenced by a few large salaries). If the median salary for a sample of statisticians were \(\bar{x}=\$66,416\), we might use this as a basis for concluding that the median salary for all statisticians exceeds $60,000.

The population mean \(\mu\) and median \(\bar{\mu}\) will not generally be identical. If the population distribution is positively or negatively skewed, as pictured in Figure 1.14, then \(\mu\neq\bar{\mu}\). When this is the case, in making inferences we must first decide which of the two population characteristics is of greater interest and then proceed accordingly.

## Other Measures of Location: Quartiles, Percentiles, and Trimmed Means

The median (population or sample) divides the data set into two parts of equal size. To obtain finer measures of location, we could divide the data into more than two such parts. Roughly speaking, _quartiles_ divide the data set into four equal parts, with the observations above the third quartile constituting the upper quarter of the data set, the second quartile being identical to the median, and the first quartile

Figure 1.14: Three different shapes for a population distribution

separating the lower quarter from the upper three-quarters. Similarly, a data set (sample or population) can be even more finely divided using _percentiles_; the 99th percentile separates the highest 1% from the bottom 99%, and so on. Unless the number of observations is a multiple of 100, care must be exercised in obtaining percentiles. We will use percentiles in Chapter 4 in connection with certain models for infinite populations and so postpone discussion until that point.

The sample mean and sample median are influenced by outlying values in a very different manner--the mean greatly and the median not at all. Since extreme behavior of either type might be undesirable, we briefly consider alternative measures that are neither as sensitive as \(\bar{x}\) nor as insensitive as \(\bar{x}\). To motivate these alternatives, note that \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{x}\) are at opposite extremes of the same "family" of measures. After the data set is ordered, \(\bar{x}\) is computed by throwing away as many values on each end as one can without eliminating everything (leaving just one or two middle values) and averaging what is left. On the other hand, to compute \(\bar{x}\) one throws away nothing before averaging. To paraphrase, the mean involves trimming 0% from each end of the sample, whereas for the median the maximum possible amount is trimmed from each end. A **trimmed mean** is a compromise between \(\bar{x}\) and \(\bar{x}\). A 10% trimmed mean, for example, would be computed by eliminating the smallest 10% and the largest 10% of the sample and then averaging what remains.

Consider the following 20 observations, ordered from smallest to largest, each one representing the lifetime (in hours) of a type of incandescent lamp:

\[\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}612&623&666&744&883&898&964&970&983&1003\\ 1016&1022&1029&1058&1085&1088&1122&1135&1197&1201\end{array}\]

The average of all 20 observations is \(\bar{x}=965.0\), and \(\bar{x}=1009.5\). The 10% trimmed mean is obtained by deleting the smallest two observations (612 and 623) and the largest two (1197 and 1201) and then averaging the remaining 16 to obtain \(\bar{x}_{\text{tr}(10)}=979.1\). The effect of trimming here is to produce a "central value" that is somewhat above the mean (\(\bar{x}\) is pulled down by a few small lifetimes) and yet considerably below the median. Similarly, the 20% trimmed mean averages the middle 12 values to obtain \(\bar{x}_{\text{tr}(20)}=999.9\), even closer to the median. (See Figure 1.5.)

Generally speaking, using a trimmed mean with a moderate trimming proportion (between 5% and 25%) will yield a measure that is neither as sensitive to outliers as the mean nor as insensitive as the median. For this reason, trimmed means have merited increasing attention from statisticians for both descriptive and inferential purposes. More will be said about trimmed means when point estimation is discussed in Chapter 7. As a final point, if the trimming proportion is denoted by \(\alpha\) and \(n\alpha\) is not an integer, then it is not obvious how the 100\(\alpha\)% trimmed mean

Figure 1.5: Dotplot of lifetimes (in hours) of incandescent lamps

should be computed. For example, if \(\alpha=.10\) (10%) and \(n=22\), then \(n\alpha=(22)\) (\(.10)=2.2\), and we cannot trim 2.2 observations from each end of the ordered sample. In this case, the 10% trimmed mean would be obtained by first trimming two observations from each end and calculating \(\bar{x}_{\text{tr}}\), then trimming three and calculating \(\bar{x}_{\text{tr}}\), and finally interpolating between the two values to obtain \(\bar{x}_{\text{tr}(10)}\).

### Categorical Data and Sample Proportions

When the data is categorical, a frequency distribution or relative frequency distribution provides an effective tabular summary of the data. The natural numerical summary quantities in this situation are the individual frequencies and the relative frequencies. For example, if a survey of individuals who own laptops is undertaken to study brand preference, then each individual in the sample would identify the brand of laptop that he or she owned, from which we could count the number owning Sony, Macintosh, Hewlett-Packard, and so on. Consider sampling a dichotomous population--one that consists of only two categories (such as voted or did not vote in the last election, does or does not own a laptop, etc.). If we let \(x\) denote the number in the sample falling in category A, then the number in category B is \(n-x\). The relative frequency or _sample proportion_ in category A is \(x/n\) and the sample proportion in category B is \(1-x/n\). Let's denote a response that falls in category A by a 1 and a response that falls in category B by a 0. A sample size of \(n=10\) might then yield the responses 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1. The sample mean for this numerical sample is (because the number of 1's \(=x=7\)).

\[\frac{x_{1}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}=\frac{1+1+0+\cdots+1+1}{n}=\frac{7}{10}=\frac{x} {n}=\text{sample proportion}\]

This result can be generalized and summarized as follows: _If in a categorical data situation we focus attention on a particular category and code the sample results so that a \(1\) is recorded for an individual in the category and a \(0\) for an individual not in the category, then the sample proportion of individuals in the category is the sample mean of the sequence of 1's and 0's._ Thus a sample mean can be used to summarize the results of a categorical sample. These remarks also apply to situations in which categories are defined by grouping values in a numerical sample or population (e.g., we might be interested in knowing whether individuals have owned their present automobile for at least 5 years, rather than studying the exact length of ownership).

Analogous to the sample proportion \(x/n\) of individuals falling in a particular category, let \(p\) represent the proportion of individuals in the entire population falling in the category. As with \(x/n\), \(p\) is a quantity between 0 and 1. While \(x/n\) is a sample characteristic, \(p\) is a characteristic of the population. The relationship between the two parallels the relationship between \(\bar{x}\) and \(\tilde{\mu}\) and between \(\bar{x}\) and \(\mu\). In particular, we will subsequently use \(x/n\) to make inferences about \(p\). If, for example, a sample of 100 car owners reveals that 22 owned their cars at least 5 years, then we might use 22/100 \(=.22\) as a point estimate of the proportion of all owners who have owned their car at least 5 years. We will study the properties of \(x/n\) as an estimator of \(p\) and see how \(x/n\) can be used to answer other inferential questions. With \(k\) categories (\(k>2\)), we can use the \(k\) sample proportions to answer questions about the population proportions \(p_{1}\),..., \(p_{k}\).

## Measures of Variability for Sample Data

The simplest measure of variability in a sample is the **range**, which is the difference between the largest and smallest sample values. Notice that the value of the range for sample 1 in Figure 16 is much larger than it is for sample 3, reflecting more variability in the first sample than in the third. A defect of the range, though, is that it depends on only the two most extreme observations and disregards the positions of the remaining \(n-2\) values. Samples 1 and 2 in Figure 16 have identical ranges, yet when we take into account the observations between the two extremes, there is much less variability or dispersion in the second sample than in the first.

Our primary measures of variability involve the **deviations from the mean**, \(x_{1}-\bar{x},x_{2}-\bar{x},\ldots,x_{n}-\bar{x}\). That is, the deviations from the mean are obtained by subtracting \(\bar{x}\) from each of the \(n\) sample observations. A deviation will be positive if the observation is larger than the mean (to the right of the mean on the measurement axis) and negative if the observation is smaller than the mean. If all the deviations are small in magnitude, then all \(x_{i}\)'s are close to the mean and there is little variability. On the other hand, if some of the deviations are large in magnitude, then some \(x_{i}\)'s lie far from \(\bar{x}\), suggesting a greater amount of variability. A simple way to combine the deviations into a single quantity is to average them (sum them and divide by \(n\)). Unfortunately, there is a major problem with this suggestion:

\[\text{sum of deviations}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)=0\]

so that the average deviation is always zero. The verification uses several standard rules of summation and the fact that \(\sum\bar{x}=\bar{x}+\bar{x}+\cdots+\bar{x}=n\bar{x}\):

\[\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)=\sum x_{i}-\sum\bar{x}=\sum x_{i}-n\bar{x}=\sum x _{i}-n\bigg{(}\frac{1}{n}\sum x_{i}\bigg{)}=0\]

How can we change the deviations to nonnegative quantities so the positive and negative deviations do not counteract each other when they are combined? One possibility is to work with the absolute values of the deviations and calculate the average absolute deviation \(\sum|x_{i}-\bar{x}|/n\). Because the absolute value operation leads to a number of theoretical difficulties, consider instead the squared deviations \((x_{1}-\bar{x})^{2},(x_{2}-\bar{x})^{2},\ldots,(x_{n}-\bar{x})^{2}\). Rather than use the average squared deviation \(\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}/n\), for several reasons we will divide the sum of squared deviations by \(n-1\) rather than \(n\).

[] The **sample variance**, denoted by \(s^{2}\), is given by

\[s^{2}=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}{n-1}=\frac{S_{xx}}{n-1}\]

The **sample standard deviation**, denoted by \(s\), is the (positive) square root of the variance:The unit for \(s\) is the same as the unit for each of the \(x_{i}\)'s. If, for example, the observations are fuel efficiencies in miles per gallon, then we might have \(s=2.0\) mpg. A rough interpretation of the sample standard deviation is that it is the size of a typical or representative deviation from the sample mean within the given sample. Thus if \(s=2.0\) mpg, then some \(x_{i}\)'s in the sample are closer than 2.0 to \(\bar{x}\), whereas others are farther away; 2.0 is a representative (or "standard") deviation from the mean fuel efficiency. If \(s=3.0\) for a second sample of cars of another type, a typical deviation in this sample is roughly 1.5 times what it is in the first sample, an indication of more variability in the second sample.

The website www.fueleconomy.gov contains a wealth of information about fuel characteristics of various vehicles. In addition to EPA mileage ratings, there are many vehicles for which users have reported their own values of fuel efficiency (mpg). Consider Table 3 with \(n=11\) efficiencies for the 2009 Ford Focus equipped with an automatic transmission (for this model, the EPA reports an overall rating of 27-24 mpg in city driving and 33 mpg in highway driving).

Effects of rounding account for the sum of deviations not being exactly zero. The numerator of \(s^{2}\) is \(S_{xx}=314.110\), from which

\[s^{2}=\frac{S_{xx}}{n-1}=\frac{314.110}{11-1}=31.41\qquad\quad s=5.60\]

The size of a representative deviation from the sample mean 33.26 is roughly 5.6 mpg.

[_Note_: Of the nine people who also reported driving behavior, only three did more than 80% of their driving in highway mode; we bet you can guess which cars they drove. We haven't a clue why all 11 reported values exceed the EPA figure - maybe only drivers with really good fuel efficiencies communicate their results.]

## Motivation for s\({}^{2}\)

To explain why \(s^{2}\) rather than the average squared deviation is used to measure variability, note first that whereas \(s^{2}\) measures sample variability, there is a measure of variability in the population called the _population variance_. We will use \(\sigma^{2}\) (the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r} \hline \hline  & \(x_{i}\) & \(x_{i}-\bar{x}\) & \((x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}\) \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 3: Data for Example 14square of the lowercase Greek letter sigma) to denote the population variance and \(\sigma\) to denote the population standard deviation (the square root of \(\sigma^{2}\)). When the population is finite and consists of \(N\) values,

\[\sigma^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}{(x_{i}-\mu)^{2}/N}\]

which is the average of all squared deviations from the population mean (for the population, the divisor is \(N\) and not \(N-1\)). More general definitions of \(\sigma^{2}\) appear in Chapters 3 and 4.

Just as \(\bar{x}\) will be used to make inferences about the population mean \(\mu\), we should define the sample variance so that it can be used to make inferences about \(\sigma^{2}\). Now note that \(\sigma^{2}\) involves squared deviations about the population mean \(\mu\). If we actually knew the value of \(\mu\), then we could define the sample variance as the average squared deviation of the sample \(x_{i}\)'s about \(\mu\). However, the value of \(\mu\) is almost never known, so the sum of squared deviations about \(\bar{x}\) must be used. But _the \(x_{i}\)'s tend to be closer to their average \(\bar{x}\) than to the population average \(\mu\), so to compensate for this the divisor \(n-1\) is used rather than \(n\)_. In other words, if we used a divisor \(n\) in the sample variance, then the resulting quantity would tend to underestimate \(\sigma^{2}\) (produce estimated values that are too small on the average), whereas dividing by the slightly smaller \(n-1\) corrects this underestimation.

It is customary to refer to \(s^{2}\) as being based on \(n-1\)**degrees of freedom** (df). This terminology results from the fact that although \(s^{2}\) is based on the \(n\) quantities \(x_{1}-\bar{x},x_{2}-\bar{x},\ldots,x_{n}-\bar{x}\), these sum to 0, so specifying the values of any \(n-1\) of the quantities determines the remaining value. For example, if \(n=4\) and \(x_{1}-\bar{x}=8\), \(x_{2}-\bar{x}=-6\), and \(x_{4}-\bar{x}=-4\), then automatically \(x_{3}-\bar{x}=2\), so only three of the four values of \(x_{i}-\bar{x}\) are freely determined (3 df).

## A Computing Formula for \(s^{2}\)

Computing and squaring the deviations can be tedious, especially if enough decimal accuracy is being used in \(\bar{x}\) to guard against the effects of rounding. An alternative formula for the numerator of \(s^{2}\) circumvents the need for all the subtraction necessary to obtain the deviations. The formula involves both \(\left(\sum x_{i}\right)^{2}\), summing and then squaring, and \(\sum x_{i}^{2}\), squaring and then summing.

An alternative expression for the numerator of \(s^{2}\) is

\[S_{xx}=\sum{(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}=\sum{x_{i}^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum x_{i}\right) ^{2}}{n}}\]

Because \(\bar{x}=\sum{x_{i}/n}\), \(n\bar{x}^{2}=n{\left(\sum x_{i}\right)^{2}/n^{2}}={\left(\sum x_{i}\right)^{2} /n}\). Then,

\[\sum{(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}= \sum{(x_{i}^{2}-2\bar{x}\cdot x_{i}+\bar{x}^{2})}=\sum{x_{i}^{2}- 2\bar{x}\sum x_{i}+\sum{(\bar{x}^{2})}}\] \[= \sum{x_{i}^{2}-2\bar{x}\cdot n\bar{x}+n{(\bar{x})^{2}}}=\sum{x_{ i}^{2}-n{(\bar{x})^{2}}}=\sum{x_{i}^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum x_{i}\right)^{2}}{n}}\]
Traumatic knee dislocation often requires surgery to repair ruptured ligaments. One measure of recovery is range of motion (measured as the angle formed when, starting with the leg straight, the knee is bent as far as possible). The given data on postsurgical range of motion appeared in the article "Reconstruction of the Anterior and Posterior Cruciate Ligaments After Knee Dislocation" (_Amer. J. Sports Med._, 1999: 189-197):

\[154\quad 142\quad 137\quad 133\quad 122\quad 126\quad 135\quad 135\quad 108 \quad 120\quad 127\quad 134\quad 122\]

The sum of these 13 sample observations is \(\sum x_{i}=1695\), and the sum of their squares is

\[\sum x_{i}^{2}=154^{2}+142^{2}+\cdots+122^{2}=222,581\]

Thus the numerator of the sample variance is

\[S_{xx}=\sum x_{i}^{2}-[(\sum x_{i})^{2}]/n=222,581-(1695)^{2}/13=1579.0769\]

from which \(s^{2}=1579.0769/12=131.59\) and \(s=11.47\). 

The shortcut method can yield values of \(s^{2}\) and \(s\) that differ from the values computed using the definitions. These differences are due to effects of rounding and will not be important in most samples. To minimize the effects of rounding when using the shortcut formula, intermediate calculations should be done using several more significant digits than are to be retained in the final answer. Because the numerator of \(s^{2}\) is the sum of nonnegative quantities (squared deviations), \(s^{2}\) is guaranteed to be nonnegative. Yet if the shortcut method is used, particularly with data having little variability, a slight numerical error can result in the numerator being zero or negative [\(\sum x_{i}^{2}\) less than or equal to \((\sum x_{i})^{2}/n\)]. Of course, a negative \(s^{2}\) is wrong, and a zero \(s^{2}\) should occur only if all data values are the same.

As an example of the potential difficulties with the formula, consider the data 1001, 1002, 1003. The formula gives \(S_{xx}=\)1001\({}^{2}+1002^{2}+1003^{2}-(1001+1002+1003)^{2}/3=3,\)012,014 \(-\) 3,012,012 \(=2\). Thus, we could carry six decimal digits and still get the wrong answer of 3,012,010 \(-\) 3,012,010 \(=0\). All seven digits must be carried to get the right answer. The problem occurs because we are subtracting two numbers of nearly equal size, so the number of accurate digits in the answer is many fewer than in the numbers being subtracted.

Several other properties of \(s^{2}\) can facilitate its computation.

Let \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n}\) be a sample and \(c\) be a constant.

1. If \(y_{1}=x_{1}+c\), \(y_{2}=x_{2}+c\),..., \(y_{n}=x_{n}+c\), then \(s_{y}^{2}=s_{x}^{2}\), and
2. If \(y_{1}=cx_{1}\),..., \(y_{n}=cx_{n}\), then \(s_{y}^{2}=c^{2}s_{x}^{2}\), \(s_{y}=|c|s_{x}\),

where \(s_{x}^{2}\) is the sample variance of the \(x\)'s and \(s_{y}^{2}\) is the sample variance of the \(y\)'s.

In words, Result 1 says that if a constant \(c\) is added to (or subtracted from) each data value, the variance is unchanged. This is intuitive, because adding or subtracting \(c\) shifts the location of the data set but leaves distances between data values unchanged. According to Result 2, multiplication of each \(x_{i}\) by \(c\) results in \(s^{2}\) being multiplied by a factor of \(c^{2}\). These properties can be proved by noting in Result 1 that \(\bar{y}=\bar{x}+c\) and in Result 2 that \(\bar{y}=c\bar{x}\) (see Exercise 59).

### Boxplots

Stem-and-leaf displays and histograms convey rather general impressions about a data set, whereas a single summary such as the mean or standard deviation focuses on just one aspect of the data. In recent years, a pictorial summary called a _boxplot_ has been used successfully to describe several of a data set's most prominent features. These features include (1) center, (2) spread, (3) the extent and nature of any departure from symmetry, and (4) identification of "outliers," observations that lie unusually far from the main body of the data. Because even a single outlier can drastically affect the values of \(\bar{x}\) and \(s\), a boxplot is based on measures that are "resistant" to the presence of a few outliers--the median and a measure of spread called the _fourth spread_.

Order the \(n\) observations from smallest to largest and separate the smallest half from the largest half; the median \(\bar{x}\) is included in both halves of \(n\) is odd. Then the **lower fourth** is the median of the smallest half and the **upper fourth** is the median of the largest half. A measure of spread that is resistant to outliers is the **fourth spread**\(f_{s}\), given by

\[f_{s}=\text{upper fourth}-\text{lower fourth}\]

Roughly speaking, the fourth spread is unaffected by the positions of those observations in the smallest 25% or the largest 25% of the data.

The simplest boxplot is based on the following five-number summary:

\[\text{smallest}\,x_{i}\qquad\text{lower fourth}\qquad\text{median}\qquad\text {upper fourth}\qquad\text{largest}\,x_{i}\]

First, draw a horizontal measurement scale. Then place a rectangle above this axis; the left edge of the rectangle is at the lower fourth, and the right edge is at the upper fourth (so box width \(=f_{s}\)). Place a vertical line segment or some other symbol inside the rectangle at the location of the median; the position of the median symbol relative to the two edges conveys information about skewness in the middle 50% of the data. Finally, draw "whiskers" out from either end of the rectangle to the smallest and largest observations. A boxplot with a vertical orientation can also be drawn by making obvious modifications in the construction process.

Ultrasound was used to gather the accompanying corrosion data on the thickness of the floor plate of an aboveground tank used to store crude oil ("Statistical Analysis of UT Corrosion Data from Floor Plates of a Crude Oil Aboveground Storage Tank," _Mater. Eval._, 1994: 846-849); each observation is the largest pit depth in the plate, expressed in milli-in.

Figure 1.17 shows the resulting boxplot. The right edge of the box is much closer to the median than is the left edge, indicating a very substantial skew in the middle half of the data. The box width (\(f_{s}\)) is also reasonably large relative to the range of the data (distance between the tips of the whiskers).

Figure 1.18 shows MINITAB output from a request to describe the corrosion data. The trimmed mean is the average of the 17 observations that remain after the largest and smallest values are deleted (trimming percentage \(\approx\)5%). Q1 and Q3 are the lower and upper quartiles; these are similar to the fourths but are calculated in a slightly different manner. SE Mean is \(s/\sqrt{n}\); this will be an important quantity in our subsequent work concerning inferences about \(\mu\).

## 10 Boxplots That Show Outliers

A boxplot can be embellished to indicate explicitly the presence of outliers.

Figure 1.18: MINITAB description of the pit-depth data

Let's now modify our previous construction of a boxplot by drawing a whisker out from each end of the box to the smallest and largest observations that are _not_ outliers. Each mild outlier is represented by a closed circle and each extreme outlier by an open circle. Some statistical computer packages do not distinguish between mild and extreme outliers.

The Clean Water Act and subsequent amendments require that all waters in the United States meet specific pollution reduction goals to ensure that water is "fishable and swimmable." The article "Spurious Correlation in the USEPA Rating Curve Method for Estimating Pollutant Loads" (_J. Environ. Eng._, 2008: 610-618) investigated various techniques for estimating pollutant loads in watersheds; the authors "discuss the imperative need to use sound statistical methods" for this purpose. Among the data considered is the following sample of TN (total nitrogen) loads (kg N/day) from a particular Chesapeake Bay location, displayed here in increasing order.

\[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}9.69&13.16&17.09&18.12&23.70&24.07&24.29&26.43\\ 30.75&31.54&35.07&36.99&40.32&42.51&45.64&48.22\\ 49.98&50.06&55.02&57.00&58.41&61.31&64.25&65.24\\ 66.14&67.68&81.40&90.80&92.17&92.42&100.82&101.94\\ 103.61&106.28&106.80&108.69&114.61&120.86&124.54&143.27\\ 143.75&149.64&167.79&182.50&192.55&193.53&271.57&292.61\\ 312.45&352.09&371.47&444.68&460.86&563.92&690.11&826.54\\ 1529.35&&&&&&\end{array}\]

Relevant summary quantities are

\[\begin{array}{ll}\bar{x}=92.17&\text{lower fourth}=45.64&\text{upper fourth}=167.79\\ f_{s}=122.15&1.5f_{s}=183.225&3f_{s}=366.45\\ \end{array}\]

Subtracting \(1.5f_{s}\) from the lower fourth gives a negative number, and none of the observations are negative, so there are no outliers on the lower end of the data. However,

\[\text{upper fourth}+1.5f_{s}{=351.015}\qquad\text{upper fourth}+3f_{s}{=534.24}\]

Thus the four largest observations -- 563.92, 690.11, 826.54, and 1529.35 -- are extreme outliers, and 352.09, 371.47, 444.68, and 460.86 are mild outliers.

The whiskers in the boxplot in Figure 19 extend out to the smallest observation 9.69 on the low end and 312.45, the largest observation that is not an outlier, on the upper end. There is some positive skewness in the middle half of the data (the median line is somewhat closer to the right edge of the box than to the left edge) and a great deal of positive skewness overall.

## Chapter 7 Conclusion

The term **probability** refers to the study of randomness and uncertainty. In any situation in which one of a number of possible outcomes may occur, the theory of probability provides methods for quantifying the chances, or likelihoods, associated with the various outcomes. The language of probability is constantly used in an informal manner in both written and spoken contexts. Examples include such statements as "It is likely that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will increase by the end of the year," "There is a 50-50 chance that the incumbent will seek reelection," "There will probably be at least one section of that course offered next year," "The odds favor a quick settlement of the strike," and "It is expected that at least 20,000 concert tickets will be sold." In this chapter, we introduce some elementary probability concepts, indicate how probabilities can be interpreted, and show how the rules of probability can be applied to compute the probabilities of many interesting events. The methodology of probability will then permit us to express in precise language such informal statements as those given above.

The study of probability as a branch of mathematics goes back over 300 years, where it had its genesis in connection with questions involving games of chance. Many books are devoted exclusively to probability and explore in great detail numerous interesting aspects and applications of this lovely branch of mathematics. Our objective here is more limited in scope: We will focus on those topics that are central to a basic understanding and also have the most direct bearing on problems of statistical inference.

## Chapter 2 Sample Spaces and Events

An **experiment** is any action or process whose outcome is subject to uncertainty. Although the word _experiment_ generally suggests a planned or carefully controlled laboratory testing situation, we use it here in a much wider sense. Thus experiments that may be of interest include tossing a coin once or several times, selecting a card or cards from a deck, weighing a loaf of bread, ascertaining the commuting time from home to work on a particular morning, obtaining blood types from a group of individuals, or calling people to conduct a survey.

### 2.1 The Sample Space of an Experiment

The simplest experiment to which probability applies is one with two possible outcomes. One such experiment consists of examining a single fuse to see whether it is defective. The sample space for this experiment can be abbreviated as \(\mathcal{S}=\{N,D\}\), where \(N\) represents not defective, \(D\) represents defective, and the braces are used to enclose the elements of a set. Another such experiment would involve tossing a thumbtack and noting whether it landed point up or point down, with sample space \(\mathcal{S}=\{U,D\}\), and yet another would consist of observing the gender of the next child born at the local hospital, with \(\mathcal{S}=\{M,F\}\). 

If we examine three fuses in sequence and note the result of each examination, then an outcome for the entire experiment is any sequence of \(N\)'s and \(D\)'s of length 3, so

\[\mathcal{S}=\{NNN,NND,NDN,NDD,DNN,DND,DDN,DDD\}\]

If we had tossed a thumbtack three times, the sample space would be obtained by replacing \(N\) by \(U\) in \(\mathcal{S}\) above. A similar notational change would yield the sample space for the experiment in which the genders of three newborn children are observed. 

Two gas stations are located at a certain intersection. Each one has six gas pumps. Consider the experiment in which the number of pumps in use at a particular time of day is determined for each of the stations. An experimental outcome specifies how many pumps are in use at the first station and how many are in use at the second one. One possible outcome is (2, 2), another is (4, 1), and yet another is (1, 4). The 49 outcomes in \(\mathcal{S}\) are displayed in the accompanying table. The sample space for the experiment in which a six-sided die is thrown twice results from deleting the 0 row and 0 column from the table, giving 36 outcomes.

If a new type-D flashlight battery has a voltage that is outside certain limits, that battery is characterized as a failure (\(F\)); if the battery has a voltage within the prescribed limits, it is a success (\(S\)). Suppose an experiment consists of testing each battery as it comes off an assembly line until we first observe a success. Although it may not be very likely, a possible outcome of this experiment is that the first 10 (or 100 or 1000 or \(\ldots\)) are \(F\)'s and the next one is an \(S\). That is, for any positive integer n, we may have to examine \(n\) batteries before seeing the first \(S\). The sample space is \(\mathcal{S}=\{S,\ FFS,\ FFFS,\ \ldots\}\), which contains an infinite number of possible outcomes. The same abbreviated form of the sample space is appropriate for an experiment in which, starting at a specified time, the gender of each newborn infant is recorded until the birth of a male is observed. 

## Events

In our study of probability, we will be interested not only in the individual outcomes of \(\mathcal{S}\) but also in any collection of outcomes from \(\mathcal{S}\).

Suppose that when the experiment is performed, the outcome is \(LLL\). Then the simple event \(E_{1}\) has occurred and so also have the events \(B\) and \(C\) (but not \(A\)). 

When the number of pumps in use at each of two 6-pump gas stations is observed, there are 49 possible outcomes, so there are 49 simple events: \(E_{1}=\{(0,\,0)\}\), \(E_{2}=\{(0,\,1)\}\),..., \(E_{49}=\{(6,\,6)\}\). Examples of compound events are

\[A=\{(0,\,0),\,(1,\,1),\,(2,\,2),\,(3,\,3),\,(4,\,4),\,(5,\,5),\,(6,\,6)\}=\text{the event that the number of pumps in use is the same for both stations

\[B=\{(0,\,4),\,(1,\,3),\,(2,\,2),\,(3,\,1),\,(4,\,0)\}=\text{the event that the total number of pumps in use is four}\]

\[C=\{(0,0),\,(0,\,1),(1,0),(1,1)\}=\text{the event that at most one pump is in use at each station}\]

The sample space for the battery examination experiment contains an infinite number of outcomes, so there are an infinite number of simple events. Compound events include

\[A=\{S,\,FS,\,FFS\}=\text{the event that at most three batteries are examined}\]

\[E=\{FS,\,FFS,\,FFFFS,\,\ldots\}=\text{the event that an even number of batteries are examined}\]

### Some Relations from Set Theory

An event is nothing but a set, so relationships and results from elementary set theory can be used to study events. The following operations will be used to construct new events from given events.

**Definition 1**: _The_ **union** _of two events_ \(A\) _and_ \(B\)_, denoted by_ \(A\cup B\) _and read "_\(A\) or_ \(B\)_," is the event consisting of all outcomes that are_ either in_ \(A\) _or in_ \(B\) _or in both events_ (so that the union includes outcomes for which both_ \(A\) _and_ \(B\) _occur as well as outcomes for which exactly one occurs)--that is, all outcomes in at least one of the events._
**2.** _The_ **intersection** _of two events_ \(A\) _and_ \(B\)_, denoted by_ \(A\cap B\) _and read "_\(A\) _and_ \(B\)_," is the event consisting of all outcomes that are in_ _both_ \(A\) _and_ \(B\)_._
**3.** _The_ **complement** _of an event_ \(A\)_, denoted by_ \(A^{\prime}\)_, is the set of all outcomes in_ \(\mathcal{S}\) _that are not contained in_ \(A\)_._

For the experiment in which the number of pumps in use at a single six-pump gas station is observed, let \(A=\{0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,4\}\), \(B=\{3,\,4,\,5,\,6\}\), and \(C=\{1,\,3,\,5\}\). Then

\[A\cup B =\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}=\mathcal{S}\quad A\cup C=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\] \[A\cap B =\{3,4\}\qquad A\cap C=\{1,3\}\quad A^{\prime}=\{5,6\}\quad\{A \cup C\}^{\prime}=\{6\}\]In the battery experiment, define \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) by

\[A =\{S,FS,FFS\}\] \[B =\{S,FFS,FFFFS\}\] and \[C =\{FS,FFFS,FFFFS,\ldots\}\] Then \[A\cup B =\{S,FS,FFFS,FFFFS\}\] \[A\cap B =\{S,FFS\}\] \[A^{\prime} =\{FFFS,FFFFS,FFFFFS,\ldots\}\] and \[C^{\prime} =\{S,FFS,FFFFS,\ldots\}=\{\text{an odd number of batteries are examined}\}\]

Sometimes \(A\) and \(B\) have no outcomes in common, so that the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\) contains no outcomes.

When \(A\) and \(B\) have no outcomes in common, they are said to be **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** events. Mathematicians write this compactly as \(A\cap B=\emptyset\) where \(\emptyset\) denotes the event consisting of no outcomes whatsoever (the "null" or "empty" event).

A small city has three automobile dealerships: a GM dealer selling Chevrolets and Buicks; a Ford dealer selling Fords and Lincolns; and a Chrysler dealer selling Jeeps and Chryslers. If an experiment consists of observing the brand of the next car sold, then the events \(A=\{\text{Chevrolet, Buick}\}\) and \(B=\{\text{Ford, Lincoln}\}\) are mutually exclusive because the next car sold cannot be both a GM product and a Ford product

The operations of union and intersection can be extended to more than two events. For any three events \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), the event \(A\cup B\cup C\) is the set of outcomes contained in at least one of the three events, whereas \(A\cap B\cap C\) is the set of outcomes contained in all three events. Given events \(A_{1}\), \(A_{2}\), \(A_{3}\),..., these events are said to be mutually exclusive (or pairwise disjoint) if no two events have any outcomes in common.

A pictorial representation of events and manipulations with events is obtained by using Venn diagrams. To construct a Venn diagram, draw a rectangle whose interior will represent the sample space \(\mathcal{E}\). Then any event A is represented as the interior of a closed curve (often a circle) contained in \(\mathcal{E}\). Figure 2.1 shows examples of Venn diagrams.

## 2.2 Axioms, Interpretations, and Properties of Probability

Given an experiment and a sample space \(\mathcal{S}\), _the objective of probability is to assign to each event \(A\) a number P(\(A\)), called the probability of the event \(A\), which will give a precise measure of the chance that \(A\) will occur_. To ensure that the probability assignments will be consistent with our intuitive notions of probability, all assignments should satisfy the following axioms (basic properties) of probability.

You might wonder why the third axiom contains no reference to a _finite_ collection of disjoint events. It is because the corresponding property for a finite collection can be derived from our three axioms. We want our axiom list to be as short as possible and not contain any property that can be derived from others on the list. Axiom 1 reflects the intuitive notion that the chance of \(A\) occurring should be nonnegative. The sample space is by definition the event that must occur when the experiment is performed (\(\mathcal{S}\) contains all possible outcomes), so Axiom 2 says that the maximum possible probability of 1 is assigned to \(\mathcal{S}\). The third axiom formalizes the idea that if we wish the probability that at least one of a number of events will occur and no two of the events can occur simultaneously, then the chance of at least one occurring is the sum of the chances of the individual events.

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & \(P(\emptyset)=0\) where \(\emptyset\) is the null event. This in turn implies that the property contained in Axiom 3 is valid for a _finite_ collection of events. \\ \end{tabular}

Proof.: First consider the infinite collection \(A_{1}=\emptyset\), \(A_{2}=\emptyset\), \(A_{3}=\emptyset,\ldots\). Since \(\emptyset\cap\emptyset=\emptyset\), the events in this collection are disjoint and \(\cup A_{i}=\emptyset\). The third axiom then gives

\[P(\emptyset)=\sum P(\emptyset)\]

This can happen only if \(P(\emptyset)=0\).

Now suppose that \(A_{1},\ A_{2},\ \ldots\,\ A_{k}\) are disjoint events, and append to these the infinite collection \(A_{k+1}=\emptyset\), \(A_{k+2}=\emptyset\), \(A_{k+3}=\emptyset,\ldots\). Again invoking the third axiom,

\[P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{k}A_{i}\right)=P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i} \right)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}P(A_{i})=\sum_{i=1}^{k}P(A_{i})\]

as desired. 

Consider tossing a thumbtack in the air. When it comes to rest on the ground, either its point will be up (the outcome \(U\)) or down (the outcome \(D\)). The sample space for this event is therefore \(\mathcal{S}=\{U,D\}\). The axioms specify \(P(\mathcal{S})=1\), so the probability assignment will be completed by determining \(P(U)\) and \(P(D)\). Since \(U\) and \(D\) are disjoint and their union is \(\mathcal{S}\), the foregoing proposition implies that

\[1=P(\mathcal{S})=P(U)+P(D)\]It follows that \(P(D)=1-P(U)\). One possible assignment of probabilities is \(P(U)=.5\), \(P(D)=.5\), whereas another possible assignment is \(P(U)=.75\), \(P(D)=.25\). In fact, letting \(p\) represent any fixed number between 0 and 1, \(P(U)=p,\ P(D)=1-p\) is an assignment consistent with the axioms. 

Consider the experiment in Example 2.4, in which batteries coming off an assembly line are tested one by one until one having a voltage within prescribed limits is found. The simple events are \(E_{1}=\{S\}\), \(E_{2}=\{FS\}\), \(E_{3}=\{FFS\},\ E_{4}=\{FFFS\},\ \ldots\). Suppose the probability of any particular battery being satisfactory is.99. Then it can be shown that \(P(E_{1})=.99\), \(P(E_{2})=(.01)(.99),P(E_{3})=(.01)^{2}(.99),\ \ldots\) is an assignment of probabilities to the simple events that satisfies the axioms. In particular, because the \(E_{i}\)'s are disjoint and \(\mathcal{E}=E_{1}\cup E_{2}\cup E_{3}\cup\ldots\), it must be the case that

\[1 = P(S)=P(E_{1})+P(E_{2})+P(E_{3})+\cdots\] \[=.99[1+.01+(.01)^{2}+(.01)^{3}+\cdots]\]

Here we have used the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[a+ar+ar^{2}+ar^{3}+\cdots=\frac{a}{1-r}\]

However, another legitimate (according to the axioms) probability assignment of the same "geometric" type is obtained by replacing.99 by any other number \(p\) between 0 and 1 (and.01 by 1\(-p\)). 

### Interpreting Probability

Examples 2.11 and 2.12 show that the axioms do not completely determine an assignment of probabilities to events. The axioms serve only to rule out assignments inconsistent with our intuitive notions of probability. In the tack-tossing experiment of Example 2.11, two particular assignments were suggested. The appropriate or correct assignment depends on the nature of the thumbtack and also on one's interpretation of probability. The interpretation that is most frequently used and most easily understood is based on the notion of relative frequencies.

Consider an experiment that can be repeatedly performed in an identical and independent fashion, and let \(A\) be an event consisting of a fixed set of outcomes of the experiment. Simple examples of such repeatable experiments include the tack-tossing and die-tossing experiments previously discussed. If the experiment is performed \(n\) times, on some of the replications the event \(A\) will occur (the outcome will be in the set \(A\)), and on others, \(A\) will not occur. Let \(n(A)\) denote the number of replications on which \(A\) does occur. Then the ratio \(n(A)/n\) is called the _relative frequency_ of occurrence of the event \(A\) in the sequence of \(n\) replications. Empirical evidence, based on the results of many of these sequences of repeatable experiments, indicates that as \(n\) grows large, the relative frequency \(n(A)/n\) stabilizes, as pictured in Figure 2.2. That is, as \(n\) gets arbitrarily large, the relative frequency approaches a limiting value we refer to as the _limiting relative frequency_ of the event \(A\). The objective interpretation of probability identifies this limiting relative frequency with \(P(A)\).

If probabilities are assigned to events in accordance with their limiting relative frequencies, then we can interpret a statement such as "The probability of that coin landing with the head facing up when it is tossed is.5" to mean that in a large number of such tosses, a head will appear on approximately half the tosses and a tail on the other half.

This relative frequency interpretation of probability is said to be objective because it rests on a property of the experiment rather than on any particular individual concerned with the experiment. For example, two different observers of a sequence of coin tosses should both use the same probability assignments since the observers have nothing to do with limiting relative frequency. In practice, this interpretation is not as objective as it might seem, because the limiting relative frequency of an event will not be known. Thus we will have to assign probabilities based on our beliefs about the limiting relative frequency of events under study. Fortunately, there are many experiments for which there will be a consensus with respect to probability assignments. When we speak of a fair coin, we shall mean \(P(H)=P(T)=.5\), and a fair die is one for which limiting relative frequencies of the six outcomes are all equal, suggesting probability assignments \(P(\{1\})=\cdots=P(\{6\})=1/6\).

Because the objective interpretation of probability is based on the notion of limiting frequency, its applicability is limited to experimental situations that are repeatable. Yet the language of probability is often used in connection with situations that are inherently unrepeatable. Examples include: "The chances are good for a peace agreement;" "It is likely that our company will be awarded the contract;" and "Because their best quarterback is injured, I expect them to score no more than 10 points against us." In such situations we would like, as before, to assign numerical probabilities to various outcomes and events (e.g., the probability is.9 that we will get the contract). We must therefore adopt an alternative interpretation of these probabilities. Because different observers may have different prior information and opinions concerning such experimental situations, probability assignments may now differ from individual to individual. Interpretations in such situations are thus referred to as _subjective_. The book by Robert Winkler listed in the chapter references gives a very readable survey of several subjective interpretations.

**More Probability Properties**

**PROPOSITION**

**For any event \(A\), \(P(A)=1-P(A^{\prime})\)**

**Proof** Since by definition of \(A^{\prime}\), \(A\cup A^{\prime}=\mathcal{E}\) while \(A\) and \(A\)' are disjoint, \(1=P(\mathcal{E})=P(A\cup A^{\prime})=P(A)+P(A^{\prime})\), from which the desired result follows.

This proposition is surprisingly useful because there are many situations in which \(P(A^{\prime})\) is more easily obtained by direct methods than is \(P(A)\).

Consider a system of five identical components connected in series, as illustrated in Figure 2.3.

Denote a component that fails by \(F\) and one that doesn't fail by \(S\) (for success). Let \(A\) be the event that the _system_ fails. For \(A\) to occur, at least one of the individual components must fail. Outcomes in \(A\) include _SSFSS_ (1, 2, 4, and 5 all work, but 3 does not), _FFSSS_, and so on. There are in fact 31 different outcomes in \(A\). However, \(A^{\prime}\), the event that the system works, consists of the single outcome _SSSS_. We will see in Section 2.5 that if 90% of all these components do not fail and different components fail independently of one another, then \(P(A^{\prime})=P(\text{SSSSS})=.9^{5}=.59\). Thus \(P(A)=1-.59=.41\); so among a large number of such systems, roughly 41% will fail.

In general, the foregoing proposition is useful when the event of interest can be expressed as "at least...," because the complement "less than..." may be easier to work with. (In some problems, "more than..." is easier to deal with than "at most...") When you are having difficulty calculating \(P(A)\) directly, think of determining \(P(A^{\prime})\).

**PROPOSITION**

**For any event \(A\), \(P(A)\leq 1\).

This follows from the previous proposition, \(1=P(A)+P(A^{\prime})\geq P(A)\), because \(P(A^{\prime})\geq 0\).

When \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, we know that \(P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\). How can this union probability be obtained when the events are not disjoint?

**PROPOSITION**

**For any events A and B,**

\[P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).\]

Figure 2.3: A system of five components connected in seriesNotice that the proposition is valid even if \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, since then \(P(A\cap B)=0\). The key idea is that, in adding \(P(A)\) and \(P(B)\), the probability of the intersection \(A\cap B\) is actually counted twice, so \(P(A\cap B)\) must be subtracted out.

Proof.: Note first that \(A\cup B=A\cup(B\cap A^{\prime})\), as illustrated in Figure 2.4. Because \(A\) and \((B\cap A^{\prime})\) are disjoint, \(P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B\cap A^{\prime})\). But \(B=(B\cap A)\cup(B\cap A^{\prime})\) (the union of that part of \(B\) in \(A\) and that part of \(B\) not in \(A\)). Furthermore, \((B\cap A)\) and \((B\cap A^{\prime})\) are disjoint, so that \(P(B)=P(B\cap A)+P(B\cap A^{\prime})\). Combining these results gives

\[P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B\cap A^{\prime}) =P(A)+[P(B)-P(A\cap B)]\] \[=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)\]

In a certain residential suburb, 60% of all households get internet service from the local cable company, 80% get television service from that company, and 50% get both services from the company. If a household is randomly selected, what is the probability that it gets at least one of these two services from the company, and what is the probability that it gets exactly one of the services from the company?

With \(A=\{\)gets internet service from the cable company \(\}\) and \(B=\{\)gets television service from the cable company \(\}\), the given information implies that \(P(A)=.6\), \(P(B)=.8\), and \(P(A\cap B)=.5\). The previous proposition then applies to give

\(P(\)gets at least one of these two services from the company\()\)

\[P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)=.6+.8-.5=.9\]

The event that a household gets only television service from the company can be written as \(A^{\prime}\cap B\) [(not internet) and television]. Now Figure 2.4 implies that

\[.9=P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(A^{\prime}\cap B)=.6+P(A^{\prime}\cap B)\]

from which \(P(A^{\prime}\cap B)=.3\). Similarly, \(P(A\cap B^{\prime})=P(A\cup B)-P(B)=.1\). This is all illustrated in Figure 2.5, from which we see that

\[P(\text{exactly one})=P(A\cap B^{\prime})+P(A^{\prime}\cap B)=.1+.3=.4\]

The probability of a union of more than two events can be computed analogously. For three events \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), the result is

Figure 2.4. Representing \(A\cup B\) as a union of disjoint events

Figure 2.5. Probabilities for Example 2.14

\[P(A\cup B\cup C) =P(A)+P(B)+P(C)-P(A\cap B)-P(A\cap C)\] \[\quad-P(B\cap C)+P(A\cap B\cap C).\]

This can be seen by examining a Venn diagram of \(A\cup B\cup C\), which is shown in Figure 2.6. When \(P(A)\), \(P(B)\), and \(P(C)\) are added, outcomes in certain intersections are double counted and the corresponding probabilities must be subtracted. But this results in \(P(A\cap B\cap C)\) being subtracted once too often, so it must be added back. One formal proof involves applying the previous proposition to \(P((A\cup B)\cup C)\), the probability of the union of the two events \(A\cup B\) and C. More generally, a result concerning \(P(A_{1}\cup\cdots\cup A_{k})\) can be proved by induction or by other methods.

### Determining Probabilities Systematically

When the number of possible outcomes (simple events) is large, there will be many compound events. \(A\) simple way to determine probabilities for these events that avoids violating the axioms and derived properties is to first determine probabilities \(P(E_{i})\) for all simple events. These should satisfy \(P(E_{i})\geq 0\) and \(\Sigma_{\text{all}}\,P(E_{i})=1\). Then the probability of any compound event \(A\) is computed by adding together the \(P(E_{i})\)'s for all \(E_{i}\)'s in \(A\).

\[P(A)=\sum_{\text{all}\,E_{i}^{\prime}\,\text{s in}\,A}\]

During off-peak hours a commuter train has five cars. Suppose a commuter is twice as likely to select the middle car (#3) as to select either adjacent car (#2 or #4), and is twice as likely to select either adjacent car as to select either end car (#1 or #5). Let \(p_{i}=P(\text{car}\ i\ \text{is selected})=P(E_{i})\). Then we have \(p_{3}=2p_{2}=2p_{4}\) and \(p_{2}=2p_{1}=2p_{5}=p_{4}\). This gives

\[1=\sum P(E_{i})=p_{1}+2p_{1}+4p_{1}+2p_{1}+p_{1}=10p_{1}\]

implying \(p_{1}=p_{5}=.1\), \(p_{2}=p_{4}=.2\), and \(p_{3}=.4\). The probability that one of the three middle cars is selected (a compound event) is then \(p_{2}+p_{3}+p_{4}=.8\). 

### Equally Likely Outcomes

In many experiments consisting of \(N\) outcomes, it is reasonable to assign equal probabilities to all \(N\) simple events. These include such obvious examples as tossing a fair coin or fair die once or twice (or any fixed number of times), or selecting one or several cards from a well-shuffled deck of 52. With \(p=P(E_{i})\) for every \(i\),\[1=\sum_{i=1}^{N}P(E_{i})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}p=p\cdot N\quad\text{so}\quad p=\frac{1}{N}\]

That is, if there are \(N\) possible outcomes, then the probability assigned to each is \(1/N\).

Now consider an event \(A\), with \(N(A)\) denoting the number of outcomes contained in \(A\). Then

\[P(A)=\sum_{E_{i}\text{ in }A}P(E_{i})=\sum_{E_{i}\text{ in }A}\frac{1}{N}=\frac{N(A)}{N}\]

Once we have counted the number \(N\) of outcomes in the sample space, to compute the probability of any event we must count the number of outcomes contained in that event and take the ratio of the two numbers. Thus when outcomes are equally likely, computing probabilities reduces to counting.

When two dice are rolled separately, there are \(N=36\) outcomes (delete the first row and column from the table in Example 2.3). If both the dice are fair, all 36 outcomes are equally likely, so \(P(E_{i})=1/36\). Then the event \(A=\{\) sum of two numbers\(=7\}\) consists of the six outcomes (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 2), and (6, 1), so

\[P(A)=\frac{N(A)}{N}=\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\]

A family has just moved to a new city and requires the services of both an obstetrician and a pediatrician. There are two easily accessible medical clinics, each having two obstetricians and three pediatricians. The family will obtain maximum health insurance benefits by joining a clinic and selecting both doctors from that clinic. In how many ways can this be done? Denote the obstetricians by \(O_{1}\), \(O_{2}\), \(O_{3}\), and \(O_{4}\) and the pediatricians by \(P_{1},\ \ldots,\ P_{6}\). Then we wish the number of pairs (\(O_{i}\), \(P_{j}\)) for which \(O_{i}\) and \(P_{j}\) are associated with the same clinic. Because there are four obstetricians, \(n_{1}=4\), and for each there are three choices of pediatrician, so \(n_{2}=3\). Applying the product rule gives \(N=n_{1}n_{2}=12\) possible choices. 

### Tree Diagrams

In many counting and probability problems, a configuration called a _tree diagram_ can be used to represent pictorially all the possibilities. The tree diagram associated with Example 2.18 appears in Figure 2.7. Starting from a point on the left side of the diagram, for each possible first element of a pair a straight-line segment emanates rightward. Each of these lines is referred to as a first-generation branch. Now for any given first-generation branch we construct another line segment emanating from the tip of the branch for each possible choice of a second element of the pair. Each such line segment is a second-generation branch. Because there are four obstetricians, there are four first-generation branches, and three pediatricians for each obstetrician yields three second-generation branches emanating from each first-generation branch.

Figure 2.7: Tree diagram for Example 2.18

Generalizing, suppose there are \(n_{1}\) first-generation branches, and for each first-generation branch there are \(n_{2}\) second-generation branches. The total number of second-generation branches is then \(n_{1}n_{2}\). Since the end of each second-generation branch corresponds to exactly one possible pair (choosing a first element and then a second puts us at the end of exactly one second-generation branch), there are \(n_{1}n_{2}\) pairs, verifying the product rule.

The construction of a tree diagram does not depend on having the same number of second-generation branches emanating from each first-generation branch. If the second clinic had four pediatricians, then there would be only three branches emanating from two of the first-generation branches and four emanating from each of the other two first-generation branches. A tree diagram can thus be used to represent pictorially experiments when the product rule does not apply.

## A More General Product Rule

If a six-sided die is tossed five times in succession rather than just twice, then each possible outcome is an ordered collection of five numbers such as (1, 3, 1, 2, 4) or (6, 5, 2, 2, 2). We will call an ordered collection of \(k\) objects a \(k\)**-tuple** (so a pair is a 2-tuple and a triple is a 3-tuple). Each outcome of the die-tossing experiment is then a 5-tuple.

\begin{tabular}{p{34.1pt} p{341.4pt}} PRODUCT & Suppose a set consists of ordered collections of \(k\) elements (\(k\)-tuples) and that there are \(n_{1}\) possible choices for the first element; for each choice of the first element, there are \(n_{2}\) possible choices of the second element;\(\ldots\); for each possible choice of the first \(k-1\) elements, there are \(n_{k}\) choices of the \(k\)th element. Then there are \(n_{1}n_{2}\)\(\cdots\cdots n_{k}\) possible \(k\)-tuples. \\ \end{tabular}

This more general rule can also be illustrated by a tree diagram; simply construct a more elaborate diagram by adding third-generation branches emanating from the tip of each second generation, then fourth-generation branches, and so on, until finally \(k\)th-generation branches are added.

Suppose the home remodeling job involves first purchasing several kitchen appliances. They will all be purchased from the same dealer, and there are five dealers in the area. With the dealers denoted by \(D_{1},\)\(\ldots,\)\(D_{5}\), there are \(N=n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}=(5)(12)(9)=540\) 3-tuples of the form (\(D_{i}\), \(P_{j}\), \(Q_{k}\)), so there are 540 ways to choose first an appliance dealer, then a plumbing contractor, and finally an electrical contractor. \(\blacksquare\)

If each clinic has both three specialists in internal medicine and two general surgeons, there are \(n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}n_{4}=(4)(3)(3)(2)=72\) ways to select one doctor of each type such that all doctors practice at the same clinic. \(\blacksquare\)

## Permutations

So far the successive elements of a \(k\)-tuple were selected from entirely different sets (e.g., appliance dealers, then plumbers, and finally electricians). In several tosses of a die, the set from which successive elements are chosen is always {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},but the choices are made "with replacement" so that the same element can appear more than once. We now consider a fixed set consisting of \(n\) distinct elements and suppose that a \(k\)-tuple is formed by selecting successively from this set _without replacement_ so that an element can appear in at most one of the \(k\) positions.

Any ordered sequence of \(k\) objects taken from a set of \(n\) distinct objects is called a **permutation** of size \(k\) of the objects. The number of permutations of size \(k\) that can be constructed from the \(n\) objects is denoted by \(P_{k,n}\).

The number of permutations of size \(k\) is obtained immediately from the general product rule. The first element can be chosen in \(n\) ways, for each of these \(n\) ways the second element can be chosen in \(n-1\) ways, and so on; finally, for each way of choosing the first \(k-1\) elements, the \(k\)th element can be chosen in \(n-(k-1)=n-k+1\) ways, so

\[P_{k,n}=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots\cdot(n-k+2)(n-k+1)\]

Ten teaching assistants are available for grading papers in a particular course. The first exam consists of four questions, and the professor wishes to select a different assistant to grade each question (only one assistant per question). In how many ways can assistants be chosen to grade the exam? Here \(n=\) the number of assistants = 10 and \(k=\) the number of questions = 4. The number of different grading assignments is then \(P_{4,10}=(10)(9)(8)(7)=5040\).

The use of factorial notation allows \(P_{k,n}\) to be expressed more compactly.

For any positive integer \(m\), \(m!\) is read "\(m\) factorial" and is defined by \(m!=m(m-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot(2)(1)\). Also, \(0!=1\).

Using factorial notation, \((10)(9)(8)(7)=(10)(9)(8)(7)(6!)/6!=10!/6!\). More generally,

\[P_{k,n} = n(n-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot(n-k+1)\] \[= \frac{n(n-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot(n-k+1)(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot (2)(1)}{(n-k)(n-k-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot(2)(1)}\]

which becomes

\[P_{k,n}=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\]

For example, \(P_{3,9}=9!/(9-3)!=9!/6!=9\cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6!/6!=9\cdot 8\cdot 7\). Note also that because \(0!=1\), \(P_{n,n}=n!/(n-n)!=n!/0!=n!/1=n!\), as it should.

## Combinations

Often the objective is to count the number of _unordered_ subsets of size \(k\) that can be formed from a set consisting of \(n\) distinct objects. For example, in bridge it is only the 13 cards in a hand and not the order in which they are dealt that is important; in the formation of a committee, the order in which committee members are listed is frequently unimportant.

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Given a set of \(n\) distinct objects, any unordered subset of size \(k\) of the objects is called a **combination**. The number of combinations of size \(k\) that can be formed from \(n\) distinct objects will be denoted by \(\binom{n}{k}\). (This notation is more common in probability than \(C_{k,n}\), which would be analogous to notation for permutations.)

The number of combinations of size \(k\) from a particular set is smaller than the number of permutations because, when order is disregarded, some of the permutations correspond to the same combination. Consider, for example, the set \(\{A,B,C,D,E\}\) consisting of five elements. There are \(5!/(5-3)!=60\) permutations of size 3. There are six permutations of size 3 consisting of the elements \(A,B\), and \(C\) because these three can be ordered \(3\cdot 2\cdot 1=3!=6\) ways: (\(A\), \(B\), \(C\)), (\(A\), \(C\), \(B\)), (\(B\), \(A\), \(C\)), (\(B\), \(C\), \(A\)), (\(C\), \(A\), \(B\)), and (\(C\), \(B\), \(A\)). These six permutations are equivalent to the single combination \(\{A,B,C\}\). Similarly, for any other combination of size 3, there are \(3!\) permutations, each obtained by ordering the three objects. Thus,

\[60=P_{3,5}=\left(\begin{array}{c}5\\ 3\end{array}\right)\cdot 3!\qquad\text{so }\left(\begin{array}{c}5\\ 3\end{array}\right)=\frac{60}{3!}=10\]

These ten combinations are

\[\{A,B,C\}\ \{A,B,D\}\ \{A,B,E\}\ \{A,C,D\}\ \{A,C,E\}\{A,D,E\}\ \{B,C,D\}\] \[\{B,C,E\}\ \{B,D,E\}\ \{C,D,E\}\]

When there are \(n\) distinct objects, any permutation of size \(k\) is obtained by ordering the \(k\) unordered objects of a combination in one of \(k!\) ways, so the number of permutations is the product of \(k!\) and the number of combinations. This gives

\[\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\ k\end{array}\right)=\frac{P_{k,n}}{k!}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]

Notice that \(\binom{n}{n}=1\) and \(\binom{n}{0}=1\) because there is only one way to choose a set of (all) \(n\) elements or of no elements, and \(\binom{n}{1}=n\) since there are \(n\) subsets of size 1.

A bridge hand consists of any 13 cards selected from a 52-card deck without regard to order. There are \(\binom{52}{13}=52!/(13!\cdot 39!)\) different bridge hands, which works out to approximately 635 billion. Since there are 13 cards in each suit, the number of hands consisting entirely of clubs and/or spades (no red cards) is \(\binom{26}{13}=26!/(13!\cdot 13!)=10,400,600\). One of these \(\binom{26}{13}\) hands consists entirely of spades, and one consists entirely of clubs, so there are \(\left[\binom{26}{13}-2\right]\) hands that consist entirely of clubs andspades with both suits represented in the hand. Suppose a bridge hand is dealt from a well-shuffled deck (i.e., 13 cards are randomly selected from among the 52 possibilities) and let

\[\begin{array}{l}A=\{\mbox{the hand consists entirely of spades and clubs with both suits represented}\}\\ B=\{\mbox{the hand consists of exactly two suits}\}\end{array}\]

The \(N={52\choose 13}\) possible outcomes are equally likely, so

\[P(A)=\frac{N(A)}{N}=\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}26\\ 13\end{array}\right)-2}{\left(\begin{array}{c}52\\ 13\end{array}\right)}=.0000164\]

Since there are \({4\choose 2}=6\) combinations consisting of two suits, of which spades and clubs is one such combination,

\[P(B)=\frac{N(B)}{N}=\frac{6\left[\left(\begin{array}{c}26\\ 13\end{array}\right)-2\right]}{\left(\begin{array}{c}52\\ 13\end{array}\right)}=.0000983\]

That is, a hand consisting entirely of cards from exactly two of the four suits will occur roughly once in every 10,000 hands. If you play bridge only once a month, it is likely that you will never be dealt such a hand. \(\blacksquare\)

A university warehouse has received a shipment of 25 printers, of which 10 are laser printers and 15 are inkjet models. If 6 of these 25 are selected at random to be checked by a particular technician, what is the probability that exactly 3 of those selected are laser printers (so that the other 3 are inkjets)?

Let \(D_{3}=\{\mbox{exactly 3 of the 6 selected are inkjet printers}\}\). Assuming that any particular set of 6 printers is as likely to be chosen as is any other set of 6, we have equally likely outcomes, so \(P(D_{3})=N(D_{3})/N\), where \(N\) is the number of ways of choosing 6 printers from the 25 and \(N(D_{3})\) is the number of ways of choosing 3 laser printers and 3 inkjet models. Thus \(N={25\choose 6}\). To obtain \(N(D_{3})\), think of first choosing 3 of the 15 inkjet models and then 3 of the laser printers. There are \({15\choose 3}\) ways of choosing the 3 inkjet models, and there are \({10\choose 3}\) ways of choosing the 3 laser printers; \(N(D_{3})\) is now the product of these two numbers (visualize a tree diagram--we are really using a product rule argument here), so

\[P(D_{3})=\frac{N(D_{3})}{N}=\frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}15\\ 3\end{array}\right){10\choose 3}}{\left(\begin{array}{c}25\\ 6\end{array}\right)}=\frac{\frac{15!}{3!2!}\cdot\frac{10!}{3!7!}}{\frac{25!}{6!1 9!}}=.3083\]Let \(D_{4}=\{\) exactly 4 of the 6 printers selected are inkjet models\(\}\) and define \(D_{5}\) and \(D_{6}\) in an analogous manner. Then the probability that at least 3 inkjet printers are selected is \[P(D_{3}\cup D_{4}\cup D_{5}\cup D_{6}) =P(D_{3})+P(D_{4})+P(D_{5})+P(D_{6})\] \[= \frac{\binom{15}{3}\binom{10}{3}}{\binom{25}{6}}+\frac{\binom{15}{ 4}\binom{10}{2}}{\binom{25}{6}}\] \[+\frac{\binom{15}{5}\binom{10}{1}}{\binom{25}{6}}+\frac{\binom{15 }{6}\binom{10}{0}}{\binom{25}{6}}=.8530\] \(\blacksquare\)

What is the probability that all three molecules of each type end up next to each other (such as in _BBBAAADDDCCC_)?

## 2.4 Conditional Probability

The probabilities assigned to various events depend on what is known about the experimental situation when the assignment is made. Subsequent to the initial assignment, partial information about or relevant to the outcome of the experiment may become available. Such information may cause us to revise some of our probability assignments. For a particular event \(A\), we have used \(P(A)\) to represent the probability assigned to \(A\); we now think of \(P(A)\) as the original or unconditional probability of the event \(A\).

In this section, we examine how the information "an event \(B\) has occurred" affects the probability assigned to \(A\). For example, \(A\) might refer to an individual having a particular disease in the presence of certain symptoms. If a blood test is performed on the individual and the result is negative (\(B=\) negative blood test), then the probability of having the disease will change (it should decrease, but not usually to zero, since blood tests are not infallible). We will use the notation \(P(A1B)\) to represent the **conditional probability of \(A\) given that the event \(B\) has occurred**.

Complex components are assembled in a plant that uses two different assembly lines, \(A\) and \(A^{\prime}\). Line \(A\) uses older equipment than \(A^{\prime}\), so it is somewhat slower and less reliable. Suppose on a given day line \(A\) has assembled 8 components, of which 2 have been identified as defective (\(B\)) and 6 as nondefective (\(B^{\prime}\)), whereas \(A^{\prime}\) has produced 1 defective and 9 nondefective components. This information is summarized in the accompanying table.

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline  & & **Condition** \\ \cline{2-3}
**Line** & \(B\) & \(B^{\prime}\) \\ \hline \(A\) & 2 & 6 \\ \(A^{\prime}\) & 1 & 9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Unaware of this information, the sales manager randomly selects 1 of these 18 components for a demonstration. Prior to the demonstration

\[P(\text{line }A\text{ component selected})=P(A)=\frac{N(A)}{N}=\frac{8}{18}=.444\]However, if the chosen component turns out to be defective, then the event \(B\) has occurred, so the component must have been 1 of the 3 in the \(B\) column of the table. Since these 3 components are equally likely among themselves after \(B\) has occurred,

\[P(A\,|\,B)=\frac{2}{3}=\frac{2/18}{3/18}=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} \tag{2.2}\]

In Equation (2.2), the conditional probability is expressed as a ratio of unconditional probabilities. The numerator is the probability of the intersection of the two events, whereas the denominator is the probability of the conditioning event \(B\). A Venn diagram illuminates this relationship (Figure 2.8).

Given that \(B\) has occurred, the relevant sample space is no longer \(\mathcal{E}\) but consists of just outcomes in \(B\); \(A\) has occurred if and only if one of the outcomes in the intersection occurred, so the conditional probability of \(A\) given \(B\) is proportional to \(P(A\,\cap\,B)\). The proportionality constant \(1/P(B)\) is used to ensure that the probability \(P(B\,|\,B)\) of the new sample space \(B\) equals 1.

## The Definition of Conditional Probability

Example 2.24 demonstrates that when outcomes are equally likely, computation of conditional probabilities can be based on intuition. When experiments are more complicated, though, intuition may fail us, so we want to have a general definition of conditional probability that will yield intuitive answers in simple problems. The Venn diagram and Equation (2.2) suggest the appropriate definition.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \\ DEFINITION & For any two events \(A\) and \(B\) with \(P(B)>0\), the **conditional probability of \(A\)** \\  & **given that \(B\) has occurred** is defined by \\  & \[P(A\,|\,B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\] (2.3) \\ \end{tabular}

Suppose that of all individuals buying a certain digital camera, 60% include an optional memory card in their purchase, 40% include an extra battery, and 30% include both a card and battery. Consider randomly selecting a buyer and let \(A=\{\text{memory card purchased}\}\) and \(B=\{\text{battery purchased}\}\). Then \(P(A)=.60\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11350]

A chain of video stores sells three different brands of DVD players. Of its DVD player sales, 50% are brand 1 (the least expensive), 30% are brand 2, and 20% are brand 3. Each manufacturer offers a 1-year warranty on parts and labor. It is known that 25% of brand 1's DVD players require warranty repair work, whereas the corresponding percentages for brands 2 and 3 are 20% and 10%, respectively.

1. What is the probability that a randomly selected purchaser has bought a brand 1 DVD player that will need repair while under warranty?
2. What is the probability that a randomly selected purchaser has a DVD player that will need repair while under warranty?
3. If a customer returns to the store with a DVD player that needs warranty repair work, what is the probability that it is a brand 1 DVD player? A brand 2 DVD player? A brand 3 DVD player?

The first stage of the problem involves a customer selecting one of the three brands of DVD player. Let \(A_{i}=\{\text{brand}\ i\ \text{is purchased}\}\), for \(i=1\), 2, and 3. Then \(P(A_{1})=.50\), \(P(A_{2})=.30\), and \(P(A_{3})=.20\). Once a brand of DVD player is selected, the second stage involves observing whether the selected DVD player needs warranty repair. With \(B=\{\text{needs}\ \text{repair}\}\) and \(B^{\prime}=\{\text{doesn't need repair}\}\), the given information implies that \(P(B|A_{1})=.25\), \(P(B|A_{2})=.20\), and \(P(B|A_{3})=.10\)

The tree diagram representing this experimental situation is shown in Figure 10. The initial branches correspond to different brands of DVD players; there are two second-generation branches emanating from the tip of each initial branch, one for "needs repair" and the other for "doesn't need repair."

Figure 10: Tree diagram for Example 29

The probability \(P(A_{i})\) appears on the \(i\)th initial branch, whereas the conditional probabilities \(P(B\,|\,A_{i})\) and \(P(B^{\prime}\,|\,A_{i})\) appear on the second-generation branches. To the right of each second-generation branch corresponding to the occurrence of \(B\), we display the product of probabilities on the branches leading out to that point. This is simply the multiplication rule in action. The answer to the question posed in 1 is thus \(P(A_{1}\cap B)=P(B\,|\,A_{1})\cdot P(A_{1})=.125\). The answer to question 2 is

\[\begin{split} P(B)&=P[(\text{brand 1 and repair})\text{ or }(\text{brand 2 and repair})\text{ or }(\text{brand 3 and repair})]\\ &=P(A_{1}\cap B)+P(A_{2}\cap B)+P(A_{3}\cap B)\\ &=.125+.060+.020=.205\end{split}\]

Finally,

\[\begin{split} P(A_{1}\,|\,B)&=\,\frac{P(A_{1}\cap B )}{P(B)}=\frac{.125}{.205}=.61\\ P(A_{2}\,|\,B)&=\,\frac{P(A_{2}\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{.060}{.205}=.29\end{split}\]

and

\[P(A_{3}\,|\,B)=1-P(A_{1}\,|\,B)-P(A_{2}\,|\,B)=.10\]

Notice that the initial or _prior probability_ of brand 1 is.50, whereas once it is known that the selected DVD player needed repair, the _posterior probability_ of brand 1 increases to.61. This is because brand 1 DVD players are more likely to need warranty repair than are the other brands. The posterior probability of brand 3 is \(P(A_{3}|B)=.10\) which is much less than the prior probability \(P(A_{3})=.20\). 

## Bayes' Theorem

The computation of a posterior probability \(P(A_{j}|B)\) from given prior probabilities \(P(A_{i})\) and conditional probabilities \(P(B\,|\,A_{i})\) occupies a central position in elementary probability. The general rule for such computations, which is really just a simple application of the multiplication rule, goes back to the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who lived in the eighteenth century. To state it we first need another result. Recall that events \(A_{1}\),..., \(A_{k}\) are mutually exclusive if no two have any common outcomes. The events are _exhaustive_ if one \(A_{i}\) must occur, so that \(A_{1}\cup\dots\cup A_{k}=\mathcal{E}\).

The transition from the second to the third expression in (2.6) rests on using the multiplication rule in the numerator and the law of total probability in the denominator.

The proliferation of events and subscripts in (2.6) can be a bit intimidating to probability newcomers. As long as there are relatively few events in the partition, a tree diagram (as in Example 2.29) can be used as a basis for calculating posterior probabilities without ever referring explicitly to Bayes' theorem.

To use Bayes' theorem, let \(A_{1}=\{\) individual has the disease\(\}\), \(A_{2}=\{\) individual does not have the disease\(\}\), and \(B=\{\) positive test result\(\}\). Then \(P(A_{1})=.001,\)\(P(A_{2})=.999,\)\(P(B\,|\,A_{1})=.99,\) and \(P(B\,|\,A_{2})=.02.\) The tree diagram for this problem is in Figure 12.

Next to each branch corresponding to a positive test result, the multiplication rule yields the recorded probabilities. Therefore, \(P(B)=.00099+.01998=.02097,\) from which we have

\[P(A_{1}\,|\,B)=\frac{P(A_{1}\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{.00099}{.02097}=.047\]

This result seems counterintuitive; because the diagnostic test appears so accurate, we expect someone with a positive test result to be highly likely to have the disease, whereas the computed conditional probability is only.047. However, because the disease is rare and the test only moderately reliable, most positive test results arise from errors rather than from diseased individuals. The probability of having the disease has increased by a multiplicative factor of 47 (from prior.001 to posterior.047); but to get a further increase in the posterior probability, a diagnostic test with much smaller error rates is needed. If the disease were not so rare (e.g., 25% incidence in the population), then the error rates for the present test would provide good diagnoses.

This example shows why it makes sense to be tested for a rare disease only if you are in a high-risk group. For example, most of us are at low risk for HIV infection, so testing would not be indicated, but those who are in a high-risk group should be tested for HIV. For some diseases the degree of risk is strongly influenced by age. Young women are at low risk for breast cancer and should not be tested, but older women do have increased risk and need to be tested. There is some argument about where to draw the line. If we can find the incidence rate for our group and the sensitivity and specificity for the test, then we can do our own calculation to see if a positive test result would be informative. 

An important contemporary application of Bayes' theorem is in the identification of spam e-mail messages. A nice expository article on this appears in _Statistics: A Guide to the Unknown_ (see the Chapter 1 bibliography).

## 2.5 Independence

The definition of conditional probability enables us to revise the probability \(P(A)\) originally assigned to \(A\) when we are subsequently informed that another event \(B\) has occurred; the new probability of \(A\) is \(P(A\mid B)\). In our examples, it was frequently the case that \(P(A\mid B)\) was unequal to the unconditional probability \(P(A)\), indicating that the information "\(B\) has occurred" resulted in a change in the chance of \(A\) occurring. There are other situations, though, in which the chance that \(A\) will occur or has occurred is not affected by knowledge that \(B\) has occurred, so that \(P(A\mid B) = P(A)\). It is then natural to think of \(A\) and \(B\) as independent events, meaning that the occurrence or nonoccurrence of one event has no bearing on the chance that the other will occur.

The definition of independence might seem "unsymmetrical" because we do not demand that \(P(B\,|\,A)=P(B)\) also. However, using the definition of conditional probability and the multiplication rule,

\[P(B\,|\,A)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}=\frac{P(A\,|\,B)P(B)}{P(A)} \tag{2.7}\]

The right-hand side of Equation (2.7) is \(P(B)\) if and only if \(P(A\,|\,B)=P(A)\) (independence), so the equality in the definition implies the other equality (and vice versa). It is also straightforward to show that if \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, then so are the following pairs of events: (1) \(A^{\prime}\) and \(B\), (2) \(A\) and \(B^{\prime}\), and (3) \(A^{\prime}\) and \(B^{\prime}\).

Consider an ordinary deck of 52 cards comprised of the four "suits" spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs, with each suit consisting of the 13 denominations ace, king, queen, jack, ten,..., and two. Suppose someone randomly selects a card from the deck and reveals to you that it is a face card (that is, a king, queen, or jack). What now is the probability that the card is a spade? If we let \(A=\{\,\text{spade}\,\}\) and \(B=\{\,\text{face card}\,\}\), then \(P(A)=13/52\), \(P(B)=12/52\) (there are three face cards in each of the four suits), and \(P(A\,\cap\,B)=P(\text{spade and face card})=3/52\). Thus

\[P(A\,|\,B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{3/52}{12/52}=\frac{3}{12}=\frac{1}{4 }=\frac{13}{52}=P(A)\]

Therefore, the likelihood of getting a spade is not affected by knowledge that a face card had been selected. Intuitively this is because the fraction of spades among face cards (3 out of 12) is the same as the fraction of spades in the entire deck (13 out of 52). It is also easily verified that \(P(B\,|\,A)=P(B)\), so knowledge that a spade has been selected does not affect the likelihood of the card being a jack, queen, or king. 

Let \(A\) and \(B\) be any two mutually exclusive events with \(P(A)>0\). For example, for a randomly chosen automobile, let \(A=\{\,\text{car is blue}\,\}\) and \(B=\{\,\text{car is red}\,\}\). Since the events are mutually exclusive, if \(B\) occurs, then \(A\) cannot possibly have occurred, so \(P(A\,|\,B)=0\neq P(A)\). The message here is that _if two events are mutually exclusive_, _they cannot be independent_. When \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive, the information that \(A\) occurred says something about \(B\) (it cannot have occurred), so independence is precluded. 

### \(P(A\,\cap\,B)\) When Events Are Independent

Frequently the nature of an experiment suggests that two events \(A\) and \(B\) should be assumed independent. This is the case, for example, if a manufacturer receives a circuit board from each of two different suppliers, each board is tested on arrival, and \(A=\{\,\text{first is defective}\,\}\) and \(B=\{\,\text{second is defective}\,\}\). If \(P(A)=.1\)it should also be the case that \(P(A\,{\rm 1}\,B)=.1\); knowing the condition of the second board shouldn't provide information about the condition of the first. Our next result shows how to compute \(P(A\,\cap\,B)\) when the events are independent.

\(A\) and \(B\) are independent if and only if

\[P(A\,\cap\,B)=P(A)\cdot P(B) \tag{8}\]

To paraphrase the proposition, \(A\) and \(B\) are independent events iff1 the probability that they both occur (\(A\,\cap\,B\)) is the product of the two individual probabilities. The verification is as follows:

\[P(A\,\cap\,B)=P(A\,|\,B)\cdot P(B)=P(A)\cdot P(B) \tag{9}\]

where the second equality in Equation (9) is valid iff \(A\) and \(B\) are independent. Because of the equivalence of independence with Equation (8), the latter can be used as a definition of independence.2

Footnote 1: If is an abbreviation for “if and only if.”

Footnote 2: However, the multiplication property is satisfied if \(P(B)=0\), yet \(P(A|B)\) is not defined in this case. To make the multiplication property completely equivalent to the definition of independence, we should append to that definition that \(A\) and \(B\) are also independent if either \(P(A)=0\) or \(P(B)=0\).

It is known that 30% of a certain company's washing machines require service while under warranty, whereas only 10% of its dryers need such service. If someone purchases both a washer and a dryer made by this company, what is the probability that both machines need warranty service?

Let \(A\) denote the event that the washer needs service while under warranty, and let \(B\) be defined analogously for the dryer. Then \(P(A)=.30\) and \(P(B)=.10\). Assuming that the two machines function independently of each other, the desired probability is

\[P(A\,\cap\,B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)=(.30)(.10)=.03\]

The probability that neither machine needs service is

\[P(A^{\prime}\,\cap\,B^{\prime})=P(A^{\prime})\cdot P(B^{\prime})=(.70)(.90)=.63\]

Note that, although the independence assumption is reasonable here, it can be questioned. In particular, if heavy usage causes a breakdown in one machine, it could also cause trouble for the other one.

Each day, Monday through Friday, a batch of components sent by a first supplier arrives at a certain inspection facility. Two days a week, a batch also arrives from a second supplier. Eighty percent of all supplier 1's batches pass inspection, and 90% of supplier 2's do likewise. What is the probability that, on a randomly selected day, two batches pass inspection? We will answer this assuming that on days when two batches are tested, whether the first batch passes is independent of whether the second batch does so. Figure 2.13 displays the relevant information.

\[P(\text{two pass}) =P(\text{two received}\cap\text{both pass})\] \[=P(\text{both pass}\,|\,\text{two received})\cdot P(\text{two received})\] \[=[(.8)(.9)](.4)=.288\]

### Independence of More Than Two Events

The notion of independence of two events can be extended to collections of more than two events. Although it is possible to extend the definition for two independent events by working in terms of conditional and unconditional probabilities, it is more direct and less cumbersome to proceed along the lines of the last proposition.

\begin{tabular}{l l} Definition & Events \(A_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(A_{n}\) are **mutually independent** if for every \(k\) (\(k=2\), \(3\), \(\ldots\), \(n\)) \\  & and every subset of indices \(i_{1}\), \(i_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(i_{k}\), \\  & \(P(A_{i_{1}}\cap A_{i_{2}}\cap\cdots\cap A_{i_{k}})=P(A_{i_{1}})\cdot P(A_{i_{2 }})\cdot\cdots\cdot P(A_{i_{k}})\) \\ \end{tabular}

To paraphrase the definition, the events are mutually independent if the probability of the intersection of any subset of the \(n\) events is equal to the product of the individual probabilities. As was the case with two events, we frequently specify at the outset of a problem the independence of certain events. The definition can then be used to calculate the probability of an intersection.

The article "Reliability Evaluation of Solar Photovoltaic Arrays" (_Solar Energy_, 2002: 129-141) presents various configurations of solar photovoltaic arrays consisting of crystalline silicon solar cells. Consider first the system illustrated in Figure 2.14a. There are two subsystems connected in parallel, each one containing three cells. In order for the system to function, at least one of the two parallel subsystems must work. Within each subsystem, the three cells are connected in series, so a subsystem will work only if all cells in the subsystem work. Consider a particular lifetime value \(t_{0}\), and suppose we want to determine the probability that the system lifetime exceeds \(t_{0}\). Let \(A_{i}\) denote the event that the lifetime of cell \(i\) exceeds \(t_{0}\) (\(i\!=\!1\), \(2\),..., \(6\)). We assume that the \(A_{i}\)'s are independent events (whether any particular cell lasts more than \(t_{0}\) hours has no bearing on whether any other cell does) and that \(P(A_{i})\!=\!.9\) for every \(i\) since the cells are identical. Then

\[P(\text{system lifetime exceeds }t_{0}) =P[(A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3})\cup(A_{4}\cap A_{5}\cap A_{6})]\] \[=P(A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3})+P(A_{4}\cap A_{5}\cap A_{6})\] \[\quad-P[(A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3})\cap(A_{4}\cap A_{5}\cap A_{6})]\] \[=(.9)(.9)+(.9)(.9)(.9)\] \[\quad-(.9)(.9)(.9)(.9)(.9)=.927\]

Alternatively,

\[P(\text{system lifetime exceeds }t_{0}) =1-P(\text{both subsystem lives are}\leq t_{0})\] \[=1-[P(\text{subsystem life is}\leq t_{0})]^{2}\] \[=1-[1-P(\text{subsystem life is}\!\!>\!t_{0})]^{2}\] \[=1-[1-(.9)^{3})]^{2}=.927\]

Next consider the total-cross-tied system shown in Figure 2.14b, obtained from the series-parallel array by connecting ties across each column of junctions. Now the system fails as soon as an entire column fails, and system lifetime exceeds \(t_{0}\) only if the life of every column does so. For this configuration,

\[P(\text{system lifetime exceeds }t_{0}) =[P(\text{column lifetime exceeds }t_{0})]^{3}\] \[=[1-P(\text{column lifetime is}\leq t_{0})]^{3}\] \[=[1-P(\text{both cells in a column have lifetime}\leq t_{0})]^{3}\] \[=1-[1-(.9)^{2})]^{3}=.970\]

Factors_, 1979: 99-105). * Assuming that an item has a flaw, what is the probability that it is detected by the end of the second fixation (once a flaw has been detected, the sequence of fixations terminates)? * Give an expression for the probability that a flaw will be detected by the end of the _n_th fixation. * If when a flaw has not been detected in three fixations, the item is passed, what is the probability that a flawed item will pass inspection? * Suppose 10% of all items contain a flaw [_P_(randomly chosen item is flawed) =.1]. With the assumption of part (c), what is the probability that a randomly chosen item will pass inspection (it will automatically pass if it is not flawed, but could also pass if it is flawed)? * Given that an item has passed inspection (no flaws in three fixations), what is the probability that it is actually flawed? Calculate for \(p\) =.5.
80. A lumber company has just taken delivery on a lot of 10,000 \(2\times 4\) boards. Suppose that 20% of these boards (2000) are actually too green to be used in first-quality construction. Two boards are selected at random, one after the other. Let \(A=\{\text{the first board is green}\}\) and \(B=\{\text{the second board is green}\}\). Compute \(P(A)\), \(P(B)\), and \(P(A\cap B)\) (a tree diagram might help). Are \(A\) and \(B\) independent? * With \(A\) and \(B\) independent and \(P(A)=P(B)=.2\), what is \(P(A\cap B)\)? How much difference is there between this answer and \(P(A\cap B)\) in part (a)? For purposes of calculating \(P(A\cap B)\), can we assume that \(A\) and \(B\) of part (a) are independent to obtain essentially the correct probability? * Suppose the lot consists of ten boards, of which two are green. Does the assumption of independence now yield approximately the correct answer for \(P(A\cap B)\)? What is the critical difference between the situation here and that of part (a)? When do you think that an independence assumption would be valid in obtaining an approximately correct answer to \(P(A\cap B)\)?
81. Refer to the assumptions stated in Exercise 75 and answer the question posed there for the system in the accompanying picture. How would the probability change if this were a subsystem connected in parallel to the subsystem pictured in Figure 2.14a? 
82. Professor Stander Deviation can take one of two routes on his way home from work. On the first route, there are four railroad crossings. The probability that he will be stopped by a train at any particular one of the crossings is.1, and trains operate independently at the four crossings. The other route is longer but there are only two crossings, independent of each other, with the same stoppage probability for each as on the first route. On a particular day, Professor Deviation has a meeting scheduled at home for a certain time. Whichever route he takes, he calculates that he will be late if he is stopped by trains at least half the crossings encountered. * Which route should he take to minimize the probability of being late to the meeting? * If he tosses a fair coin to decide on a route and he is late, what is the probability that he took the four-crossing route?

**89.**: Individual A has a circle of five close friends (B, C, D, E, and F). A has heard a certain rumor from outside the circle and has invited the five friends to a party to circulate the rumor. To begin, A selects one of the five at random and tells the rumor to the chosen individual. That individual then selects at random one of the four remaining individuals and repeats the rumor.

Three separate experiments result in only two detections. What is the posterior probability that the impurity is present?
**92.**: Fasteners used in aircraft manufacturing are slightly crimped so that they lock enough to avoid loosening during vibration. Suppose that 95% of all fasteners pass an initial inspection. Of the 5% that fail, 20% are so seriously defective that they must be scrapped. The remaining fasteners are sent to a recrimping operation, where 40% cannot be salvaged and are discarded. The other 60% of these fasteners are corrected by the recrimping process and subsequently pass inspection.

The probability that the second component functions in a satisfactory manner during its design life is.9, the probability that at least one of the two components does so is.96, and the probability that both components do so is.75. Given that the first component functions in a satisfactory manner throughout its design life, what is the probability that the second one does also?
**95.**: A certain company sends 40% of its overnight mail parcels via express mail service \(E_{1}\). Of these parcels, 2% arrive after the guaranteed delivery time (denote the event "late delivery" by \(L\)). If a record of an overnight mailing is randomly selected from the company's file, what is the probability that the parcel went via \(E_{1}\) and was late?
**96.**: Refer to Exercise 95. Suppose that 50% of the overnight parcels are sent via express mail service \(E_{2}\) and the remaining 10% are sent via \(E_{3}\). Of those sent via \(E_{2}\), only 1% arrive late, whereas 5% of the parcels handled by \(E_{3}\) arrive late.

**b.**: If a randomly selected parcel has arrived on time, what is the probability that it was not sent via \(E_{1}\)?
**97.**: A company uses three different assembly lines--\(A_{1}\), \(A_{2}\), and \(A_{3}\)--to manufacture a particular component. Of those manufactured by line \(A_{1}\), 5% need rework to remedy a defect, whereas 8% of \(A_{2}\)'s components need rework and 10% of \(A_{3}\)'s need rework.

the first subsequent candidate who is best among those already interviewed (if no such candidate appears, the last one interviewed is hired).

For example, with \(s = 2\), the order 3, 4, 1, 2 would result in the best being hired, whereas the order 3, 1, 2, 4 would not. Of the four possible \(s\) values (0, 1, 2, and 3), which one maximizes \(P\)(best is hired)? [_Hint_: Write out the 24 equally likely interview orderings: \(s = 0\) means that the first candidate is automatically hired.]
104. Consider four independent events \(A_{1}\), \(A_{2}\), \(A_{3}\), and \(A_{4}\) and let \(p_{i} = P(A_{i})\) for \(i = 1\), 2, 3, 4. Express the probability that at least one of these four events occurs in terms of the \(p_{i}\)'s, and do the same for the probability that at least two of the events occur.
105. A box contains the following four slips of paper, each having exactly the same dimensions: (1) win prize 1; (2) win prize 2; (3) win prize 3; (4) win prizes 1, 2, and 3. One slip will be randomly selected. Let \(A_{1} = \{\text{win prize 1}\}\), \(A_{2} = \{\text{win prize 2}\}\), and \(A_{3} = \{\text{win prize 3}\}\). Show that \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) are independent, that \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{3}\) are independent, and that \(A_{2}\) and \(A_{3}\) are also independent (this is _pairwise_ independence). However, show that \(P(A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3}) \neq P(A_{1})\cdot P(A_{2})\cdot P(A_{3})\), so the three events are not _mutually_ independent.
106. Consider a woman whose brother is afflicted with hemophilia, which implies that the woman's mother has the hemophilia gene on one of her two X chromosomes (almost surely not both, since that is generally fatal). Thus there is a 50-50 chance that the woman's mother has passed on the bad gene to her. The woman has two sons, each of whom will independently inherit the gene from one of her two chromosomes. If the woman herself has a bad gene, there is a 50-50 chance she will pass this on to a son. Suppose that neither of her two sons is afflicted with hemophilia. What then is the probability that the woman is indeed the carrier of the hemophilia gene? What is this probability if she has a third son who is also not afflicted?
107. Jurors may be a priori biased for or against the prosecution in a criminal trial. Each juror is questioned by both the prosecution and the defense (the _voir dire_ process), but this may not reveal bias. Even if bias is revealed, the judge may not excuse the juror for cause because of the narrow legal definition of bias. For a randomly selected candidate for the jury, define events \(B_{0}\), \(B_{1}\), and \(B_{2}\) as the juror being unbiased, biased against the prosecution, and biased against the defense, respectively. Also let \(C\) be the event that bias is revealed during the questioning and \(D\) be the event that the juror is eliminated for cause. Let \(b_{i} = P(B_{i})\) (\(i = 0,1,2\)), \(c = P(C|B_{1}) = P(C|B_{2})\) and \(d = P(D|B_{1}\cap C) = P(D|B_{2}\cap C)\) ["Fair Number of Peremptory Challenges in Jury Trials," _J. Amer. Statist. Assoc._, 1979: 747-753]. **a.**: If a juror survives the voir dire process, what is the probability that he/she is unbiased (in terms of the \(b_{i}\)'s, \(c\), and \(d\))? What is the probability that he/she is biased against the prosecution? What is the probability that he/she is biased against the defense? [_Hint_: Represent this situation using a tree diagram with three generations of branches.] **b.**: What are the probabilities requested in (a) if \(b_{0} =.50\), \(b_{1} =.10\), \(b_{2} =.40\) (all based on data relating to the famous trial of the Florida murderer Ted Bundy), \(c =.85\) (corresponding to the extensive questioning appropriate in a capital case), and \(d =.7\) (a "moderate" judge)?
108. Allan and Beth currently have $2 and $3, respectively. A fair coin is tossed. If the result of the toss is H, Allan wins $1 from Beth, whereas if the coin toss results in T, then Beth wins $1 from Allan. This process is then repeated, with a coin toss followed by the exchange of $1, until one of the two players goes broke (one of the two gamblers is ruined). We wish to determine \(a_{2} = P(\text{Allan is the winner | he starts with $2$})\) To do so, let's also consider \(a_{i} = P(\text{Allan wins | he starts with $i$})\) for \(i = 0\), 1, 3, 4, and 5. **a.**: What are the values of \(a_{0}\) and \(a_{3}\)? **b.**: Use the law of total probability to obtain an equation relating \(a_{2}\) to \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{3}\). [_Hint_: Condition on the result of the first coin toss, realizing that if it is a H, then from that point Allan starts with $3.] **c.**: Using the logic described in (b), develop a system of equations relating \(a_{i}\) (\(i = 1\), 2, 3, 4) to \(a_{i-1}\) and \(a_{i+1}\). Then solve these equations. [_Hint_: Write each equation so that \(a_{i} - a_{i-1}\) is on the left hand side. Then use the result of the first equation to express each other \(a_{i} - a_{i-1}\) as a function of \(a_{1}\), and add together all four of these expressions (\(i = 2\), 3, 4, 5).] **d.**: Generalize the result to the situation in which Allan's initial fortune is \(\$a\) and Beth's is \(\$b\). _Note_: The solution is a bit more complicated if \(p = P(\text{Allan wins $1$}) \neq.5\).

* **109.**: Prove that if \(P(B|A)>P(B)\) [in which case we say that "\(A\) attracts \(B\)"], then \(P(A|B)>P(A)\) ["\(B\) attracts \(A\)"].
* **110.**: Suppose a single gene determines whether the coloring of a certain animal is dark or light. The coloring will be dark if the genotype is either \(AA\) or \(Aa\) and will be light only if the genotype is \(aa\) (so \(A\) is dominant and \(a\) is recessive).

Consider two parents with genotypes \(Aa\) and \(AA\). The first contributes \(A\) to an offspring with probability 1/2 and \(a\) with probability 1/2, whereas the second contributes \(A\) for sure. The resulting offspring will be either \(AA\) or \(Aa\), and therefore will be dark colored. Assume that this child then mates with an \(Aa\) animal to produce a grandchild with dark coloring. In light of this information, what is the probability that the first-generation offspring has the \(Aa\) genotype (is heterozygous)? [_Hint_: Construct an appropriate tree diagram.]

## Chapter 11 Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions

### 11 Introduction

Whether an experiment yields qualitative or quantitative outcomes, methods of statistical analysis require that we focus on certain numerical aspects of the data (such as a sample proportion \(x|n\), mean \(\bar{x}\), or standard deviation \(s\)). The concept of a random variable allows us to pass from the experimental outcomes themselves to a numerical function of the outcomes. There are two fundamentally different types of random variables--discrete random variables and continuous random variables. In this chapter, we examine the basic properties and discuss the most important examples of discrete variables. Chapter 4 focuses on continuous random variables.

## Chapter 3 Random Variables

In any experiment, numerous characteristics can be observed or measured, but in most cases an experimenter will focus on some specific aspect or aspects of a sample. For example, in a study of commuting patterns in a metropolitan area, each individual in a sample might be asked about commuting distance and the number of people commuting in the same vehicle, but not about IQ, income, family size, and other such characteristics. Alternatively, a researcher may test a sample of components and record only the number that have failed within 1000 hours, rather than record the individual failure times.

In general, each outcome of an experiment can be associated with a number by specifying a rule of association (e.g., the number among the sample of ten components that fail to last 1000 h or the total weight of baggage for a sample of 25 airline passengers). Such a rule of association is called a **random variable**--a variable because different numerical values are possible and random because the observed value depends on which of the possible experimental outcomes results (Figure 3.1).

Random variables are customarily denoted by uppercase letters, such as \(X\) and \(Y\), near the end of our alphabet. In contrast to our previous use of a lowercase letter, such as \(x\), to denote a variable, we will now use lowercase letters to represent some particular value of the corresponding random variable. The notation \(X(s)=x\) means that \(x\) is the value associated with the outcome \(s\) by the rv \(X\).

When a student attempts to connect to a university computer system, either there is a failure (\(F\)), or there is a success (\(S\)). With \(\mathcal{E}=\{S,F\}\), define an rv \(X\) by \(X(S)=1\), \(X(F)=0\). The rv \(X\) indicates whether (1) or not (0) the student can connect. \(\blacksquare\)

In Example 3.1, the rv \(X\) was specified by explicitly listing each element of \(\mathcal{E}\) and the associated number. If \(\mathcal{E}\) contains more than a few outcomes, such a listing is tedious, but it can frequently be avoided.

Figure 3.1: A random variable

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:111]

Suppose that in some random fashion, a location (latitude and longitude) in the continental United States is selected. Define an rv \(Y\) by

\[Y=\text{the height above sea level at the selected location}\]

For example, if the selected location were (39deg50'N, 98deg35'W), then we might have \(Y((39\text{\textdegree}50\text{\textdegree}N,\,98\text{\textdegree}35\text{\textdegree}W))=1748.26\) ft. The largest possible value of \(Y\) is 14,494 (Mt. Whitney), and the smallest possible value is \(-282\) (Death Valley). The set of all possible values of \(Y\) is the set of all numbers in the interval between \(-282\) and 14,494--that is,

\[\{y\colon y\text{ is a number},-282\leq y\leq 14,494\}\]

and there are an infinite number of numbers in this interval. 

## Two Types of Random Variables

In Section 1.2 we distinguished between data resulting from observations on a counting variable and data obtained by observing values of a measurement variable. A slightly more formal distinction characterizes two different types of random variables.

**A discrete** random variable is an rv whose possible values either constitute a finite set or else can be listed in an infinite sequence in which there is a first element, a second element, and so on.

A random variable is **continuous** if _both_ of the following apply:

**1.**: Its set of possible values consists either of all numbers in a single interval on the number line (possibly infinite in extent, e.g., from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\)) or all numbers in a disjoint union of such intervals \((\text{e.g.},[0,10]\cup[20,30])\).
**2.**: No possible value of the variable has positive probability, that is, \(P(X=c)=0\) for any possible value \(c\).

Although any interval on the number line contains an infinite number of numbers, it can be shown that there is no way to create an infinite listing of all these values--there are just too many of them. The second condition describing a continuous random variable is perhaps counterintuitive, since it would seem to imply a total probability of zero for all possible values. But we shall see in Chapter 4 that _intervals_ of values have positive probability; the probability of an interval will decrease to zero as the width of the interval shrinks to zero.

All random variables in Examples 3.1-3.4 are discrete. As another example, suppose we select married couples at random and do a blood test on each person until we find a husband and wife who both have the same Rh factor. With \(X=\) the number of blood tests to be performed, possible values of \(X\) are \(D=\{2,4,6,8,\dots\}\). Since the possible values have been listed in sequence, \(X\) is a discrete rv. 

To study basic properties of discrete rv's, only the tools of discrete mathematics--summation and differences--are required. The study of continuous variables requires the continuous mathematics of the calculus--integrals and derivatives.

### 2.2 Probability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables

When probabilities are assigned to various outcomes in \(\mathcal{E}\), these in turn determine probabilities associated with the values of any particular rv \(X\). The _probability distribution of \(X\)_ says how the total probability of 1 is distributed among (allocated to) the various possible \(X\) values.

Six lots of components are ready to be shipped by a supplier. The number of defective components in each lot is as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline \hline _Lot_ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ _Number of defectives_ & 0 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

One of these lots is to be randomly selected for shipment to a customer. Let \(X\) be the number of defectives in the selected lot. The three possible \(X\) values are 0, 1, and 2. Of the six equally likely simple events, three result in \(X=0\), one in \(X=1\), and the other two in \(X=2\). Let \(p(0)\) denote the probability that \(X=0\) and \(p(1)\) and \(p(2)\) represent the probabilities of the other two possible values of \(X\). Then

\[p(0)=P(X=0)=P(\text{lot 1 or 3 or 6 is sent})=\frac{3}{6}=.500\]

\[p(1)=P(X=1)=P(\text{lot 4 is sent})=\frac{1}{6}=.167\]

\[p(2)=P(X=2)=P(\text{lot 2 or 5 is sent})=\frac{2}{6}=.333\]

That is, a probability of.500 is distributed to the \(X\) value 0, a probability of.167 is placed on the \(X\) value 1, and the remaining probability,.333, is associated with the \(X\) value 2. The values of \(X\) along with their probabilities collectively specify the probability distribution or _probability mass function of \(X\)_. If this experiment were repeated over and over again, in the long run \(X=0\) would occur one-half of the time, \(X=1\) one-sixth of the time, and \(X=2\) one-third of the time.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline DEFINITION & The **probability distribution** or **probability mass function** (pmf) of a discrete rv is defined for every number \(x\) by \(p(x)=P(X=x)=P(\text{all }s\in\mathcal{E}\): \(X(s)=x)\).1 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In words, for every possible value \(x\) of the random variable, the pmf specifies the probability of observing that value when the experiment is performed. The conditions \(p(x)\geq 0\) and \(\Sigma p(x)=1\), where the summation is over all possible \(x\), are required of any pmf.

Consider randomly selecting a student at a large public university, and define a Bernoulli rv by \(X=1\) if the selected student does not qualify for in-state tuition (a success from the university administration's point of view) and \(X=0\) if the student does qualify. If 20% of all students do not qualify, the pmf for \(X\) is

\[p(0) = P(X=0) = P(\text{the selected student does qualify}) =.8\] \[p(1) = P(X=1) = P(\text{the selected student does not qualify}) =.2\] \[p(x) = P(X=x) = 0\text{ for }x\neq 0\text{ or }1.\] \[p(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}.8&\text{if }x=0\\.2&\text{if }x=1\\ 0&\text{if }x\neq 0\text{ or }1\end{array}\right.\]

Figure 3.2 is a picture of this pmf, called a _line graph_.

Consider a group of five potential blood donors--A, B, C, D, and E--of whom only A and B have type O+ blood. Five blood samples, one from each individual, will be typed in random order until an O+ individual is identified. Let the rv \(Y=\) the number of typings necessary to identify an O+ individual. Then the pmf of \(Y\) is

\[p(1) = P(Y=1) = P(\text{A or B typed first}) = \frac{2}{5} =.4\] \[p(2) = P(Y=2) = P(\text{C},\text{D},\text{or E first, and then A or B}) = P(\text{C},\text{D},\text{or E first}) \cdot \text{P(A or B next}|\text{C},\text{D},\text{or E first}) = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} =.3\] \[p(3) = P(Y=3) = P(\text{C},\text{D},\text{ or E first and second},\text{ and then A or B}) = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} =.2\] \[p(4) = P(Y=4) = P(\text{C},\text{D},\text{ and E all done first}) = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{3} =.1\] \[p(y) = 0\text{ for }y \neq 1,2,3,4.\]

The pmf can be presented compactly in tabular form:

\[\frac{y}{p(y)} \quad 1 \quad 2 \quad 3 \quad 4\]

where any \(y\) value not listed receives zero probability. This pmf can also be displayed in a line graph (Figure 3.3).

Figure 3.2: The line graph for the pmf in Example 3.8

The name "probability mass function" is suggested by a model used in physics for a system of "point masses." In this model, masses are distributed at various locations \(x\) along a one-dimensional axis. Our pmf describes how the total probability mass of 1 is distributed at various points along the axis of possible values of the random variable (where and how much mass at each \(x\)).

Another useful pictorial representation of a pmf, called a **probability histogram**, is similar to histograms discussed in Chapter 1. Above each \(y\) with \(p(y)>0\), construct a rectangle centered at \(y\). The height of each rectangle is proportional to \(p(y)\), and the base is the same for all rectangles. When possible values are equally spaced, the base is frequently chosen as the distance between successive \(y\) values (though it could be smaller). Figure 3.4 shows two probability histograms.

## Appendix A Parameter of a Probability Distribution

In Example 3.8, we had \(p(0)=.8\) and \(p(1)=.2\) because 20% of all students did not qualify for in-state tuition. At another university, it may be the case that \(p(0)=.9\) and \(p(1)=.1\). More generally, the pmf of any Bernoulli rv can be expressed in the form \(p(1)=\alpha\) and \(p(0)=1-\alpha\), where \(0<\alpha<1\). Because the pmf depends on the particular value of \(\alpha\), we often write \(p(x;\alpha)\) rather than just \(p(x)\):

\[p(x;\alpha)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1-\alpha&\mbox{if }\,x=0\\ \alpha&\mbox{if }\,x=1\\ 0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right. \tag{3.1}\]

Then each choice of \(\alpha\) in Expression (3.1) yields a different pmf.

Figure 3.4: Probability histograms: (a) Example 3.8; (b) Example 3.9

Figure 3.3: The line graph for the pmf in Example 3.9

\begin{tabular}{p{28.5pt} p{28.5pt}}  & \\ \end{tabular}

The quantity \(\alpha\) in Expression (3.1) is a parameter. Each different number \(\alpha\) between 0 and 1 determines a different member of a family of distributions; two such members are

\[p(x;.6)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}.4&\text{if }x=0\\.6&\text{if }x=1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\quad\text{and}\quad p(x;.5)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}.5&\text{if }x=0\\.5&\text{if }x=1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Every probability distribution for a Bernoulli rv has the form of Expression (3.1), so it is called the _family of Bernoulli distributions_.

Starting at a fixed time, we observe the gender of each newborn child at a certain hospital until a boy (\(B\)) is born. Let \(p=P(B)\), assume that successive births are independent, and define the rv \(X\) by \(X=\) number of births observed. Then

\[p(1)=P(X=1)=P(B)=p\] \[p(2)=P(X=2)=P(GB)=P(G)\cdot P(B)=(1-p)p\]

and

\[p(3)=P(X=3)=P(GGB)=P(G)\cdot P(G)\cdot P(B)=(1-p)^{2}p\]

Continuing in this way, a general formula emerges:

\[p(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}(1-p)^{x-1}p&x=1,2,3,\ldots\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right. \tag{3.2}\]

The quantity \(p\) in Expression (3.2) represents a number between 0 and 1 and is a parameter of the probability distribution. In the gender example, \(p=.51\) might be appropriate, but if we were looking for the first child with Rh-positive blood, then we might have \(p=.85\). 

## The Cumulative Distribution Function

For some fixed value \(x\), we often wish to compute the probability that the observed value of \(X\) will be at most \(x\). For example, the pmf in Example 3.7 was

\[p(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}.500&x=0\\.167&x=1\\.333&x=2\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]The probability that \(X\) is at most 1 is then

\[P(X\leq 1)=p(0)+p(1)=.500+.167=.667\]

In this example, \(X\leq 1.5\) iff \(X\leq 1\), so \(P(X\leq 1.5)=P(X\leq 1)=.667\). Similarly, \(P(X\leq 0)=P(X=0)=.5\), and \(P(X\leq.75)=.5\) also. Since 0 is the smallest possible value of \(X\), \(P(X\leq-1.7)=0\), \(P(X\leq-.0001)=0\), and so on. The largest possible \(X\) value is 2, so \(P(X\leq 2)=1\), and if \(x\) is any number larger than \(2\), \(P(X\leq x)=1\); that is, \(P(X\leq 5)=1\), \(P(X\leq 10.23)=1\), and so on. Notice that \(P(X<1)=.5\neq P(X\leq 1)\), since the probability of the \(X\) value 1 is included in the latter probability but not in the former. When \(X\) is a discrete random variable and \(x\) is a possible value of \(X\), \(P(X<x)<P(X\leq x)\).

The **cumulative distribution function** (cdf) \(F(x)\) of a discrete rv \(X\) with pmf \(p(x)\) is defined for every number \(x\) by

\[F(x)=P(X\leq x)=\sum_{y:y\leq x}p(y) \tag{3.3}\]

For any number \(x\), \(F(x)\) is the probability that the observed value of \(X\) will be at most \(x\).

A store carries flash drives with either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 GB of memory. The accompanying table gives the distribution of \(Y=\) the amount of memory in a purchased drive:

\[\begin{array}{l|ccccc}y&1&2&4&8&16\\ \hline p(y)&.05&.10&.35&.40&.10\end{array}\]

Let's first determine \(F(y)\) for each of the five possible values of \(Y\):

\[F(1)=P(Y\leq 1)=P(Y=1)=p(1)=.05\] \[F(2)=P(Y\leq 2)=P(Y=1\mbox{ or }2)=p(1)+p(2)=.15\] \[F(4)=P(Y\leq 4)=P(Y=1\mbox{ or }2\mbox{ or }4)=p(1)+p(2)+p(4)=.50\] \[F(8)=P(Y\leq 8)=p(1)+p(2)+p(4)+p(8)=.90\] \[F(16)=P(Y\leq 16)=1\]

Now for any other number \(y\), \(F(y)\) will equal the value of \(F\) at the closest possible value of \(Y\) to the left of \(y\). For example,

\[F(2.7)=P(Y\leq 2.7)=P(Y\leq 2)=F(2)=.15\] \[F(7.999)=P(Y\leq 7.999)=P(Y\leq 4)=F(4)=.50\]

If \(y\) is \(<\)1, \(F(y)=0\) [e.g. \(F(.58)=0\)], and if \(y\) is at least 16, \(F(y)=1\) [e.g. \(F(25)=1\)]. The cdf is thus \[F(y)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0&y<1\\.05&1\leq y<2\\.15&2\leq y<4\\.50&4\leq y<8\\.90&8\leq y<16\\ 1&16\leq y\\ \end{array}\right.\]

A graph of this cdf is shown in Figure 3.5.

For \(X\) a discrete rv, the graph of \(F(x)\) will have a jump at every possible value of \(X\) and will be flat between possible values. Such a graph is called a **step function**.

In Example 3.10, any positive integer was a possible \(X\) value, and the pmf was

\[p(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1-p)^{x-1}p&x=1,2,3,\ldots\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

For any positive integer \(x\),

\[F(x)=\sum_{y\leq x}p(y)=\sum_{y=1}^{x}\left(1-p\right)^{y-1}p=p\sum_{y=0}^{x-1 }\left(1-p\right)^{y} \tag{3.4}\]

Figure 3.5: A graph of the cdf of Example 3.11

To evaluate this sum, we use the fact that the partial sum of a geometric series is

\[\sum_{y=0}^{k}a^{y}=\frac{1-a^{k+1}}{1-a}\]

Using this in Equation (3.4), with \(a=1-p\) and \(k=x-1\), gives

\[F(x)=p\cdot\frac{1-(1-p)^{x}}{1-(1-p)}=1-(1-p)^{x}\quad\text{$x$ a positive integer}\]

Since \(F\) is constant in between positive integers,

\[F(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}0&x<1\\ 1-(1-p)^{[x]}&x\geq 1\end{array}\right. \tag{3.5}\]

where \([x]\) is the largest integer \(\leq x\) (e.g., \([2.7]=2\)). Thus if \(p=.51\) as in the birth example, then the probability of having to examine at most five births to see the first boy is \(F(5)=1-(.49)^{5}=1-.0282=.9718\), whereas \(F(10)\approx 1.0000\). This cdf is graphed in Figure 3.6.

In our examples thus far, the cdf has been derived from the pmf. This process can be reversed to obtain the pmf from the cdf whenever the latter function is available. Suppose, for example, that \(X\) represents the number of defective components in a shipment consisting of six components, so that possible \(X\) values are 0, 1,..., 6. Then

\[p(3) =P(X=3)\] \[=\left[p(0)+p(1)+p(2)+p(3)\right]-\left[p(0)+p(1)+p(2)\right]\] \[=P(X\leq 3)-P(X\leq 2)\] \[=F(3)-F(2)\]

Figure 3.6: A graph of \(F(x)\) for Example 3.12

More generally, the probability that \(X\) falls in a specified interval is easily obtained from the cdf. For example,

\[\begin{array}{l}P(2\leq X\leq 4)=p(2)+p(3)+p(4)\\ \phantom{P(2\leq X\leq 4)}=[p(0)+\cdots+p(4)]-[p(0)+p(1)]\\ \phantom{P(2\leq X\leq 4)}=P(X\leq 4)-P(X\leq 1)\\ \phantom{P(2\leq X\leq 4)}=F(4)-F(1)\end{array}\]

Notice that \(P(2\leq X\leq 4)\neq F(4)-F(2)\). This is because the \(X\) value 2 is included in \(2\leq X\leq 4\), so we do not want to subtract out its probability. However, \(P(2<X\leq 4)=F(4)-F(2)\) because \(X=2\) is not included in the interval \(2<X\leq 4\).

For any two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a\leq b\),

\[P(a\leq X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a-)\]

where \(F(a-)\) represents the maximum of \(F(x)\) values to the left of \(a\). Equivalently, if \(a\) is the limit of values of \(x\) approaching from the left, then \(F(a-)\) is the limiting value of \(F(x)\). In particular, if the only possible values are integers and if \(a\) and \(b\) are integers, then

\[\begin{array}{l}P(a\leq X\leq b)=P(X=a\text{ or }a+1\text{ or }\ldots\text{or }b)\\ \phantom{P(2\leq X\leq b)}=F(b)-F(a-1)\end{array}\]

Taking \(a=b\) yields \(P(X=a)=F(a)-F(a-1)\) in this case.

The reason for subtracting \(F(a-)\) rather than \(F(a)\) is that we want to include \(P(X=a)\); \(F(b)-F(a)\) gives \(P(a<X\leq b)\). This proposition will be used extensively when computing binomial and Poisson probabilities in Sects. 3.5 and 3.7.

Let \(X=\) the number of days of sick leave taken by a randomly selected employee of a large company during a particular year. If the maximum number of allowable sick days per year is 14, possible values of \(X\) are 0, 1,..., 14. With \(F(0)=.58\), \(F(1)=.72\), \(F(2)=.76\), \(F(3)=.81\), \(F(4)=.88\), and \(F(5)=.94\),

\[P(2\leq X\leq 5)=P(X=2,3,4,\text{or }5)=F(5)-F(1)=.22\]

and

\[P(X=3)=F(3)-F(2)=.05\]

Now focus on the leading digit of each number, which could be 1, 2,..., 8, or 9. Your first thought might be that the leading digit \(X\) of a randomly selected number would be equally likely to be one of the nine possibilities (a discrete uniform distribution). However, much empirical evidence as well as some theoretical arguments suggest an alternative probability distribution called _Benford's law_: \[p(x)=P(1\text{st digit is }x)=\log_{10}\left(\frac{x+1}{x}\right),\] \[x=1,2,\...\,9\] **a.** Without computing individual probabilities from this formula, show that it specifies a legitimate pmf. **b.** Now compute the individual probabilities and compare to the corresponding discrete uniform distribution.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:125]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:126]

From Example 3.10 the general form for the pmf of \(X=\) the number of children born up to and including the first boy is

\[p(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}(1-p)^{x-1}p&x=1,2,3,\ldots\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

From the definition,

\[E(X) = \sum_{D}x\cdot p(x)=\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}xp(1-p)^{x-1}=p\sum_{x=1}^ {\infty}x(1-p)^{x-1} \tag{3.9}\] \[= p\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}\left[-\frac{d}{dp}(1-p)^{x}\right]\]

If we interchange the order of taking the derivative and the summation, the sum is that of a geometric series. After the sum is computed, the derivative is taken, and the final result is \(E(X)=1/p\). If \(p\) is near 1, we expect to see a boy very soon, whereas if \(p\) is near 0, we expect many births before the first boy. For \(p=.5\), \(E(X)=2\). 

There is another frequently used interpretation of \(\mu\). Consider the pmf

\[p(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}(.5)\cdot(.5)^{x-1}&x=1,2,3,\ldots\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

This is the pmf of \(X=\) the number of tosses of a fair coin necessary to obtain the first \(H\) (a special case of Example 3.18). Suppose we observe a value \(x\) from this pmf (toss a coin until an \(H\) appears), then observe independently another value (keep tossing), then another, and so on. If after observing a very large number of \(x\) values, we average them, the resulting sample average will be very near to \(\mu=2\). That is, \(\mu\) can be interpreted as the long-run average observed value of \(X\) when the experiment is performed repeatedly.

Let \(X\), the number of interviews a student has prior to getting a job, have pmf

\[p(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}k/x^{2}&x=1,2,3,\ldots\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

where \(k\) is chosen so that \(\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}\left(k/x^{2}\right)=1\). (Because \(\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}\left(1/x^{2}\right)=\pi^{2}/6\), the value of \(k\) is 6/\(\pi^{2}\).) The expected value of \(X\) is

\[\mu=E(X)=\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}x\frac{k}{x^{2}}=k\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x} \tag{3.10}\]

The sum on the right of Equation (3.10) is the famous harmonic series of mathematics and can be shown to equal \(\infty\). \(E(X)\) is not finite here because \(p(x)\) does not decrease sufficiently fast as \(x\) increases; statisticians say that the probability distribution of \(X\) has "a heavy tail." If a sequence of \(X\) values is chosen using this distribution, the sample average will not settle down to some finite number but will tend to grow without bound.

Statisticians use the phrase "heavy tails" in connection with any distribution having a large amount of probability far from \(\mu\) (so heavy tails do not require \(\mu=\infty\)). Such heavy tails make it difficult to make inferences about \(\mu\). 

## The Expected Value of a Function

Often we will be interested in the expected value of some function \(h(X)\) rather than \(X\) itself.

Suppose a bookstore purchases ten copies of a book at $6.00 each to sell at $12.00 with the understanding that at the end of a 3-month period any unsold copies can be redeemed for $2.00. If \(X\) represents the number of copies sold, then net revenue \(=h(X)=12X\) + \(2(10-X)-60=10X-40\). 

An easy way of computing the expected value of \(h(X)\) is suggested by the following example.

The cost of a certain diagnostic test on a car depends on the number of cylinders (4, 6, or 8) in the car's engine. Let \(X\) denote the number of cylinders on a randomly chosen vehicle about to undergo this test, and suppose the cost function is \(h(X)=20+3X+.5X^{2}\). Since \(X\) is a random variable, so is \(h(X)\); denote this latter rv by \(Y\). The pmf's of \(X\) and \(Y\) are as follows:

\[x\]

\[4\]

\[6\]

\[8\]

\[y\]

\[40\]

\[56\]

\[76\]

\[p(x)\]

\[.5\]

\[.3\]

\[.2\]

With \(D^{\otimes}\) denoting possible values of \(Y\),

\[E(Y) =E[h(X)]=\sum_{Ds}y\cdot p(y)\] \[=(40)(.5)+(56)(.3)+(76)(.2)\] \[=h(4)\cdot(.5)+h(6)\cdot(.3)+h(8)\cdot(.2)\] \[=\ \sum_{D}h(x)\cdot p(x) \tag{3.11}\]

According to Equation (3.11), it was not necessary to determine the pmf of \(Y\) to obtain \(E(Y)\); instead, the desired expected value is a weighted average of the possible \(h(x)\) (rather than \(x\)) values. 

If the rv \(X\) has a set of possible values \(D\) and pmf \(p(x)\), then the expected value of any function \(h(X)\), denoted by \(E[h(X)]\) or \(\mu_{h(X)}\), is computed by

\[E[h(X)]=\sum_{D}h(x)\cdot p(x)\]

assuming that \(\sum_{D}|h(x)|\cdot p(x)\) is finite.

According to this proposition, \(E[h(X)]\) is computed in the same way that \(E(X)\) itself is, except that \(h(x)\) is substituted in place of \(x\).

A computer store has purchased three computers at $500 apiece. It will sell them for $1000 apiece. The manufacturer has agreed to repurchase any computers still unsold after a specified period at $200 apiece. Let \(X\) denote the number of computers sold, and suppose that \(p(0)=.1\), \(p(1)=.2\), \(p(2)=.3\), and \(p(3)=.4\). With \(h(X)\) denoting the profit associated with selling \(X\) units, the given information implies that \(h(X)=\) revenue \(-\) cost \(=1000X\) + \(200(3-X)-1500=800X-900\). The expected profit is then

\[E[h(X)] = h(0)\cdot p(0)+h(1)\cdot p(1)+h(2)\cdot p(2)+h(3)\cdot p(3)\] \[= (-900)(.1)+(-100)(.2)+(700)(.3)+(1500)(.4)\] \[= \$700\]

The \(h(X)\) function of interest is quite frequently a linear function \(aX+b\). In this case, \(E[h(X)]\) is easily computed from \(E(X)\).

\[E(aX+b)=a\cdot E(X)+b \tag{3.12}\]

(Or, using alternative notation, \(\mu_{aX+b}=a\cdot\mu_{X}+b\).)

To paraphrase, the expected value of a linear function equals the linear function evaluated at the expected value \(E(X)\). Since \(h(X)\) in Example 3.22 is linear and \(E(X)=2\), \(E[h(X)]=800(2)-900=\$700\), as before.

**Proof**

\[E(aX+b) = \sum_{D}{(ax+b)\cdot p(x)}=a\sum_{D}{x\cdot p(x)}+b\sum_{D}{p(x)}\] \[= aE(X)+b\]

Two special cases of the proposition yield two important rules of expected value.

**1.**: For any constant \(a\), \(E(aX)=a\cdot E(X)\) [take \(b=0\) in (3.12)].
**2.**: For any constant \(b\), \(E(X+b)=E(X)\) + \(b\) [take \(a=1\) in (3.12)].

Multiplication of \(X\) by a constant \(a\) changes the unit of measurement (from dollars to cents, where \(a=100\), inches to cm, where \(a=2.54\), etc.). Rule 1 says that the expected value in the new units equals the expected value in the old units multiplied by the conversion factor \(a\). Similarly, if the constant \(b\) is added to each possible value of \(X\), then the expected value will be shifted by that same constant amount.

## The Variance of \(X\)

The expected value of \(X\) describes where the probability distribution is centered. Using the physical analogy of placing point mass \(p(x)\) at the value \(x\) on a one-dimensional axis, if the axis were then supported by a fulcrum placed at \(\mu\), there would be no tendency for the axis to tilt. This is illustrated for two different distributions in Figure 3.7.

Although both distributions pictured in Figure 3.7 have the same center \(\mu\), the distribution of Figure 3.7b has greater spread or variability or dispersion than does that of Figure 3.7a. We will use the variance of \(X\) to assess the amount of variability in (the distribution of) \(X\), just as \(s^{2}\) was used in Chapter 1 to measure variability in a sample.

The quantity \(h(X)=(X-\mu)^{2}\) is the squared deviation of \(X\) from its mean, and \(\sigma^{2}\) is the expected squared deviation. If most of the probability distribution is close to \(\mu\), then \(\sigma^{2}\) will typically be relatively small. However, if there are \(x\) values far from \(\mu\) that have large \(p(x)\), then \(\sigma^{2}\) will be quite large.

Consider again the distribution of the Apgar score \(X\) of a randomly selected newborn described in Example 3.16. The mean value of \(X\) was calculated as \(\mu=7.15\), so

\[V(X) =\sigma^{2}=\sum_{x=0}^{10}{(x-7.15)^{2}\cdot p(x)}\] \[=(0-7.15)^{2}(.002)+...+(10-7.15)^{2}(.01)=1.5815\]

The standard deviation of \(X\) is \(\sigma=\sqrt{1.5815}=1.26\).

Figure 3.7: Two different probability distributions with \(\mu=4\)When the pmf \(p(x)\) specifies a mathematical model for the distribution of population values, both \(\sigma^{2}\) and \(\sigma\) measure the spread of values in the population; \(\sigma^{2}\) is the population variance, and \(\sigma\) is the population standard deviation.

## A Shortcut Formula for \(\sigma^{2}\)

The number of arithmetic operations necessary to compute \(\sigma^{2}\) can be reduced by using an alternative computing formula.

### Proposition

\[V(X)=\sigma^{2}=\left[\sum_{D}x^{2}\cdot p(x)\right]-\mu^{2}=E(X^{2})-\left[E( X)\right]^{2}\]

In using this formula, \(E(X^{2})\) is computed first without any subtraction; then \(E(X)\) is computed, squared, and subtracted (once) from \(E(X^{2})\).

Referring back to the Apgar score scenario of Examples 3.16 and 3.23,

\[E(X^{2})=\sum_{x=0}^{10}x^{2}\cdot p(x)=(0^{2})(.002)+(1^{2})(.001)+...+(10^{2} )(.01)=52.704\]

Thus \(\sigma^{2}=52.704-(7.15)^{2}=1.5815\) as before.

### Proof of the Shortcut Formula

Expand \((x-\mu)^{2}\) in the definition of \(\sigma^{2}\) to obtain \(x^{2}-2\mu x+\mu^{2}\), and then carry \(\Sigma\) through to each of the three terms:

\[\sigma^{2} = \sum_{D}x^{2}\cdot p(x)-2\mu\cdot\sum_{D}x\cdot p(x)+\mu^{2}\sum _{D}p(x)\] \[= E(X^{2})-2\mu\cdot\mu+\mu^{2}=E(X^{2})-\mu^{2}\]

### Rules of Variance

The variance of \(h(X)\) is the expected value of the squared difference between \(h(X)\) and its expected value:

\[V[h(X)]=\sigma^{2}_{h(X)}=\sum_{D}\left\{h(x)-E[h(x)]\right\}^{2}\cdot p(x) \tag{3.13}\]

When \(h(x)\) is a linear function, \(V[h(X)]\) is easily related to \(V(X)\) (Exercise 40).
This result says that the addition of the constant \(b\) does not affect the variance, which is intuitive, because the addition of \(b\) changes the location (mean value) but not the spread of values. In particular,

\[\begin{array}{l} 1.\ \sigma_{aX}^{2}=a^{2}\cdot\sigma_{X}^{2}\quad\sigma_{aX}=|a|\cdot\sigma_{X}\\ 2.\ \sigma_{X+b}^{2}=\sigma_{X}^{2}\end{array} \tag{3.14}\]

The reason for the absolute value in \(\sigma_{aX}\) is that \(a\) may be negative, whereas a standard deviation cannot be negative; \(a^{2}\) results when \(a\) is brought outside the term being squared in Equation 3.13.

In the computer sales scenario of Example 3.22, \(E(X)=2\) and

\[E(X^{2})=(0^{2})(.1)+(1^{2})(.2)+(2^{2})(.3)+(3^{2})(.4)=5\]

so \(V(X)=5-(2)^{2}=1\). The profit function \(h(X)=800X-900\) then has variance \((800)^{2}\cdot V(X)=(640,000)(1)=640,000\) and standard deviation 800. \(\blacksquare\)

## Chapter Moments and Moment Generating Functions

Sometimes the expected values of integer powers of \(X\) and \(X-\mu\) are called **moments**, terminology borrowed from physics. Expected values of powers of \(X\) are called **moments about 0** and powers of \(X-\mu\) are called **moments about the mean**. For example, \(E(X^{2})\) is the second moment about 0, and \(E[(X-\mu)^{3}]\) is the third moment about the mean. Moments about 0 are sometimes simply called moments.

Suppose the pmf of \(X\), the number of points earned on a short quiz, is given by

\[\begin{array}{c|cccc}x&0&1&2&3\\ \hline p(x)&.1&.2&.3&.4\end{array}\]

The first moment about 0 is the mean

\[\mu=E(X)=\sum_{x\in D}xp(x)=0(.1)+1(.2)+2(.3)+3(.4)=2\]

The second moment about the mean is the variance

\[\sigma^{2} =E[(X-\mu)^{2}]=\sum_{x\in D}{(x-\mu)^{2}p(x)}\] \[=(0-2)^{2}(.1)+(1-2)^{2}(.2)+(2-2)^{2}(.3)+(3-2)^{2}(.4)=1\]

The third moment about the mean is also important.

\[E[(X-\mu)^{3}] =\sum_{x\in D}{(x-\mu)^{3}p(x)}\] \[=(0-2)^{3}(.1)+(1-2)^{3}(.2)+(2-2)^{3}(.3)+(3-2)^{3}(.4)=-.6\]

We would like to use this as a measure of lack of symmetry, but \(E[(X-\mu)^{3}]\) depends on the scale of measurement. That is, if \(X\) is measured in feet, the value is different from what would be obtained if \(X\) were measured in inches. Scale independence results from dividing the third moment about the mean by \(\sigma^{3}\):

\[\frac{E[(X-\mu)^{3}]}{\sigma^{3}}=E\Bigg{[}\Bigg{(}\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\Bigg{)}^ {3}\Bigg{]}\]

This is our measure of departure from symmetry, called the **skewness**. For a symmetric distribution the third moment about the mean would be 0, so the skewness in that case is 0. However, in the present example the skewness is \(E[(X-\mu)^{3}]/\sigma^{3}=-.6/1=-.6\). When the skewness is negative, as it is here, we say that the distribution is negatively skewed or that it is skewed to the left. Generally speaking, it means that the distribution stretches farther to the left of the mean than to the right.

If the skewness were positive then we would say that the distribution is positively skewed or that it is skewed to the right. For example, reverse the order of the probabilities in the \(p(x)\) table above, so the probabilities of the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 are now.4,.3,.2, and.1, respectively (a much harder quiz). This changes the sign but not the magnitude of the skewness, so it becomes.6 and the distribution is skewed right (see Exercise 57).

Moments are not always easy to obtain, as shown by the calculation of \(E(X)\) in Example 3.18. We now introduce the **moment generating function**, which will help in the calculation of moments and the understanding of statistical distributions. We have already discussed the expected value of a function, \(E[h(X)]\). In particular, let \(e\) denote the base of the natural logarithms, with approximate value 2.71828. Then we may wish to calculate \(E(e^{2X})=\Sigma e^{2x}p(x)\), \(E(e^{3.75X})\), or \(E(e^{-2.56X})\). That is, for any particular number \(t\), the expected value \(E(e^{dX})\) is meaningful. When we consider this expected value as a function of \(t\), the result is called the moment generating function.

The moment generating function (mgf) of a discrete random variable \(X\) is defined to be

\[M_{X}(t)=E(e^{dX})=\sum_{x\in D}e^{tx}p(x)\]

where \(D\) is the set of possible \(X\) values. We will say that the moment generating function exists if \(M_{X}(t)\) is defined for an interval of numbers that includes zero as well as positive and negative values of \(t\) (an interval including 0 in its interior).

If the mgf exists, it will be defined on a symmetric interval of the form (\(-t_{0}\), \(t_{0}\)), where \(t_{0}>0\), because \(t_{0}\) can be chosen small enough so the symmetric interval is contained in the interval of the definition.

When \(t=0\), for any random variable \(X\)

\[M_{X}(0)=E(e^{0X})=\sum_{x\in D}e^{0x}p(x)=\sum_{x\in D}1p(x)=1\]

That is, \(M_{X}(0)\) is the sum of all the probabilities, so it must always be 1. However, in order for the mgf to be useful in generating moments, it will need to be defined for an interval of values of \(t\) including 0 in its interior, and that is why we do not bother with the mgf otherwise. As you might guess, the moment generating function fails to exist in cases when moments themselves fail to exist, as in Example 3.19. See Example 3.30 below.

The simplest example of an mgf is for a Bernoulli distribution, where only the \(X\) values 0 and 1 receive positive probability.

Let \(X\) be a Bernoulli random variable with \(p(0)=\frac{1}{3}\) and \(p(1)=\frac{2}{3}\). Then

\[M_{X}(t)=E(e^{dX})=\sum_{x\in D}e^{tx}p(x)=e^{t\cdot 0}\frac{1}{3}+e^{t\cdot 1} \frac{2}{3}=\frac{1}{3}+e^{t}\frac{2}{3}\]

It should be clear that a Bernoulli random variable will always have an mgf of the form \(p(0)+p(1)e^{t}\). This mgf exists because it is defined for all \(t\).

The idea of the mgf is to have an alternate view of the distribution based on an infinite number of values of \(t\). That is, the mgf for \(X\) is a function of \(t\), and we get a different function for each different distribution. When the function is of the form of one constant plus another constant times \(e^{t}\), we know that it corresponds to a Bernoulli random variable, and the constants tell us the probabilities. This is an example of the following "uniqueness property."

If the mgf exists and is the same for two distributions, then the two distributions are the same. That is, the moment generating function uniquely specifies the probability distribution; there is a one-to-one correspondence between distributions and mgf's.

Let \(X\) be the number of claims in a year by someone holding an automobile insurance policy with a company. The mgf for \(X\) is \(M_{X}(t)=.7+.2e^{t}+.1e^{2t}\). Then we can say that the pmf of \(X\) is given by

\[\begin{array}{c|ccc}x&0&1&2\\ p(x)&.7&.2&.1\end{array}\]

Why? If we compute \(E(e^{\alpha X})\) based on this table, we get the correct mgf. Because \(X\) and the random variable described by the table have the same mgf, the uniqueness property requires them to have the same distribution. Therefore, \(X\) has the given pmf.

This is a continuation of Example 3.18, except that here we do not consider the number of births needed to produce a male child. Instead we are looking for a person whose blood type is Rh+. Set \(p=.85\), which is the approximate probability that a random person has blood type Rh+. If \(X\) is the number of people we need to check until we find someone who is Rh+, then \(p(x)=p(1-p)^{x-1}=.85(.15)^{x-1}\) for \(x=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(\dots\).

Determination of the moment generating function here requires using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

\[a+ar+ar^{2}+\dots=\frac{a}{1-r}\]

where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the ratio of successive terms, and \(|r|<1\). The moment generating function is

\[M_{X}(t) = E(e^{\alpha X})=\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}e^{tx}.85\;(.15)^{x-1}=.85e^{ t}\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}e^{t(x-1)}(.15)^{x-1}\] \[=.85e^{t}\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}\left[e^{t}(.15)\right]^{x-1}=\frac{.8 5e^{t}}{1-.15e^{t}}\]The condition on \(r\) requires \(1.15e^{t}|<1\). Dividing by \(.15\) and taking logs, this gives \(t<-\ln(.15)\approx 1.90\). The result is an interval of values that includes \(0\) in its interior, so the mgf exists.

What about the value of the mgf at \(0\)? Recall that \(M_{X}(0)=1\) always, because the value at \(0\) amounts to summing the probabilities. As a check, after computing an mgf we should make sure that this condition is satisfied. Here \(M_{X}(0)=.85/(1-.15)=1\). \(\blacksquare\)

Reconsider Example 3.19, where \(p(x)=k/x^{2}\), \(x=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(\ldots\). Recall that \(E(X)\) does not exist, so there might be problems with the mgf, too:

\[M_{X}(t)=E(e^{xX})=\sum_{x=1}^{\infty}e^{tx}\frac{k}{x^{2}}\]

With the help of tests for convergence such as the ratio test, we find that the series converges if and only if \(e^{\prime}\leq 1\), which means that \(t\leq 0\). Because zero is on the boundary of this interval, not the interior of the interval (the interval must include both positive and negative values), this mgf does not exist. Of course, it could not be useful for finding moments, because \(X\) does not have even a first moment (mean). \(\blacksquare\)

How does the mgf produce moments? We will need various derivatives of \(M_{X}(t)\). For any positive integer \(r\), let \(M_{X}^{(r)}(t)\) denote the \(r\)th derivative of \(M_{X}(t)\). By computing this and then setting \(t=0\), we get the \(r\)th moment about \(0\).

THEOREM If the mgf exists,

\[E(X^{r})=M_{X}^{(r)}(0)\]

**Proof** We show that the theorem is true for \(r=1\) and \(r=2\). A proof by mathematical induction can be used for general \(r\). Differentiate

\[\frac{d}{dt}M_{X}(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{x\in D}e^{xt}p(x)=\sum_{x\in D}\frac{d} {dt}e^{xt}p(x)=\sum_{x\in D}xe^{xt}p(x)\]

where we have interchanged the order of summation and differentiation. This is justified inside the interval of convergence, which includes \(0\) in its interior. Next we set \(t=0\) and get the first moment

\[M_{X}^{\prime}(0)=M_{X}^{(1)}(0)=\sum_{x\in D}xp(x)=E(X)\]Differentiate again:

\[\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}M_{X}(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\sum_{x\in D}xe^{u}p(x)=\sum_{x\in D}x \frac{d}{dt}e^{u}p(x)=\sum_{x\in D}x^{2}e^{u}p(x)\]

Set \(t=0\) to get the second moment

\[M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(0)=M_{X}^{(2)}(0)=\sum_{x\in D}x^{2}p(x)=E(X^{2})\]

\(\blacksquare\)

This is a continuation of Example 3.28, where \(X\) represents the number of claims in a year with pmf and mgf

\[\begin{array}{c|ccc}x&0&1&2&M_{X}(t)=.7+.2e^{t}+.1e^{2t}\\ \hline p(x)&.7&.2&.1&\\ \end{array}\]

First, find the derivatives

\[\begin{array}{c}M_{X}^{\prime}(t)=.2e^{t}+.1(2)e^{2t}\\ M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(t)=.2e^{t}+.1(2)(2)e^{2t}\\ \end{array}\]

Setting \(t\) to \(0\) in the first derivative gives the first moment

\[E(X)=M_{X}^{\prime}(0)=M_{X}^{(1)}(0)=.2e^{0}+.1(2)e^{2(0)}=.2+.1(2)=.4\]

Setting \(t\) to \(0\) in the second derivative gives the second moment

\[E(X^{2})=M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(0)=M_{X}^{(2)}(0)=.2e^{0}+.1(2)(2)e^{2(0)}=.2+.1 (2)(2)=.6\]

To get the variance recall the shortcut formula from the previous section:

\[V(X)=\sigma^{2}=E(X^{2})-\left[E(X)\right]^{2}=.6-.4^{2}=.6-.16=.44\]

Taking the square root gives \(\sigma=.66\) approximately. Do a mean of \(.4\) and a standard deviation of \(.66\) seem about right for a distribution concentrated mainly on \(0\) and \(1\)? \(\blacksquare\)

Recall that \(p=.85\) is the probability of a person having Rh + blood and we keep checking people until we find one with this blood type. If \(X\) is the number of people we need to check, then \(p(x)=.85(.15)^{x-1},x=1,2,3,\dots,\) and the mgf is

\[M_{X}(t)=E(e^{X})=\frac{.85e^{t}}{1-.15e^{t}}\]

Differentiating with the help of the quotient rule,

\[M_{X}^{\prime}(t)=\frac{.85e^{t}}{\left(1-.15e^{t}\right)^{2}}\]Setting \(t=0\), \[\mu=E(X)=M^{\prime}_{X}(0)=\frac{1}{.85}\] Recalling that.85 corresponds to \(p\), we see that this agrees with Example 3.18. To get the second moment, differentiate again: \[M^{\prime\prime}_{X}(t)=\frac{.85e^{\prime}(1+.15e^{\prime})}{\left(1-.15e^{ \prime}\right)^{3}}\] Setting \(t=0\), \[E(X^{2})=M^{\prime\prime}_{X}(0)=\frac{1.15}{.85^{2}}\] Now use the shortcut formula for the variance from the previous section: \[V(X)=\sigma^{2}=E(X^{2})-\left[E(X)\right]^{2}=\frac{1.15}{.85^{2}}-\frac{1}{. 85^{2}}=\frac{.15}{.85^{2}}=.2076\]

There is an alternate way of doing the differentiation that can sometimes make the effort easier. Define \(R_{X}(t)=\ln[M_{X}(t)]\), where \(\ln(u)\) is the natural log of \(u\). In Exercise 54 you are requested to verify that if the moment generating function exists,

\[\mu =E(X)=R^{\prime}_{X}(0)\] \[\sigma^{2} =V(X)=R^{\prime\prime}_{X}(0)\]

Here we apply \(R_{X}(t)\) to Example 3.32. Using \(\ln(e^{\prime})=t\),

\[R_{X}(t)=\ln[M_{X}(t)]=\ln\left(\frac{.85e^{\prime}}{1-.15e^{\prime}}\right)= \ln(.85)+t-\ln(1-.15e^{\prime})\]

The first derivative is

\[R^{\prime}_{X}(t)=\frac{1}{1-.15e^{\prime}}\]

and the second derivative is

\[R^{\prime\prime}_{X}(t)=\frac{.15e^{\prime}}{\left(1-.15e^{\prime}\right)^{2}}\]

Setting \(t\) to \(0\) gives

\[\mu=E(X)=R^{\prime}_{X}(0)=\frac{1}{.85}\]

\[\sigma^{2}=V(X)=R^{\prime\prime}_{X}(0)=\frac{.15}{.85^{2}}\]

These are in agreement with the results of Example 3.32.

As mentioned at the end of the previous section, it is common to transform \(X\) using a linear function \(Y=aX+b\). What happens to the mgf when we do this?

Let \(X\) have the mgf \(M_{X}(t)\) and let \(Y=aX+b\). Then \(M_{Y}(t)=e^{bt}M_{X}(at)\).

Let \(X\) be a Bernoulli random variable with \(p(0)=\frac{20}{38}\) and \(p(1)=\frac{18}{38}\). Think of \(X\) as the number of wins, 0 or 1, in a single play of roulette. If you play roulette at an American casino and you bet red, then your chances of winning are \(\frac{18}{38}\) because 18 of the 38 possible outcomes are red. Then from Example 3.27\(M_{X}(t)=\frac{20}{38}+e^{t}\frac{18}{38}\). Let your bet be \(\$5\) and let \(Y\) be your winnings. If \(X=0\) then \(Y=-5\), and if \(X=1\) then \(Y=+5\). The linear equation \(Y=10X-5\) gives the appropriate relationship.

The equation is of the form \(Y=aX+b\) with \(a=10\) and \(b=-5\), so by the proposition

\[M_{Y}(t) = e^{bt}M_{X}(at)=e^{-5t}M_{X}(10t)\] \[= e^{-5t}\left[\frac{20}{38}+e^{10t}\frac{18}{38}\right]=e^{-5t} \frac{20}{38}+e^{5t}\frac{18}{38}\]

From this we can read off the probabilities for \(Y\): \(p(-5)=\frac{20}{38}\) and \(p(5)=\frac{18}{38}\).

## 3 The Binomial Probability Distribution

Many experiments conform either exactly or approximately to the following list of requirements:

1. The experiment consists of a sequence of \(n\) smaller experiments called _trials_, where \(n\) is fixed in advance of the experiment.
2. Each trial can result in one of the same two possible outcomes (dichotomous trials), which we denote by success (\(S\)) or failure (\(F\)).
3. The trials are independent, so that the outcome on any particular trial does not influence the outcome on any other trial.
4. The probability of success is constant from trial to trial; we denote this probability by \(p\).

The same coin is tossed successively and independently \(n\) times. We arbitrarily use \(S\) to denote the outcome \(H\) (heads) and \(F\) to denote the outcome \(T\) (tails). Then this experiment satisfies Conditions 1-4. Tossing a thumbtack \(n\) times, with \(S=\) point up and \(F=\) point down, also results in a binomial experiment. 

Some experiments involve a sequence of independent trials for which there are more than two possible outcomes on any one trial. A binomial experiment can then be created by dividing the possible outcomes into two groups.

The color of pea seeds is determined by a single genetic locus. If the two alleles at this locus are AA or Aa (the genotype), then the pea will be yellow (the phenotype), and if the allele is aa, the pea will be green. Suppose we pair off 20 Aa seeds and cross the two seeds in each of the ten pairs to obtain ten new genotypes. Call each new genotype a success \(S\) if it is aa and a failure otherwise. Then with this identification of \(S\) and \(F\), the experiment is binomial with \(n=10\) and \(p=P(\text{aa}\) genotype). If each member of the pair is equally likely to contribute a or A, then \(p=P(\text{a})\cdot P(\text{a})=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)=\frac{1}{4}\) 

Suppose a city has 50 licensed restaurants, of which 15 currently have at least one serious health code violation and the other 35 have no serious violations. There are five inspectors, each of whom will inspect one restaurant during the coming week. The name of each restaurant is written on a different slip of paper, and after the slips are thoroughly mixed, each inspector in turn draws one of the slips _without replacement_. Label the \(i\)th trial as a success if the \(i\)th restaurant selected (\(i=1,\,\ldots,\,5\)) has no serious violations. Then

\[P(S\text{ on first trial})=\frac{35}{50}=.70\]

and

\[P(S\text{ on second trial}) =P(SS)+P(FS)\] \[=P(\text{second}\,S|\text{first}\,S)P(\text{first}\,S)+P(\text{ second}\,S|\text{first}\,F)P(\text{first}\,F)\] \[=\frac{34}{49}.\frac{35}{50}+\frac{35}{49}.\frac{15}{50}=\frac{3 5}{50}\left(\frac{34}{49}+\frac{15}{49}\right)=\frac{35}{50}=.70\]

Similarly, it can be shown that \(P(S\text{ on }i\text{th trial})=.70\) for \(i=3,\,4,\,5\). However,

\[P(S\text{ on fifth trial}|SSSS)=\frac{31}{46}=.67\]

whereas

\[P(S\text{ on fifth trial}|FFFF))=\frac{35}{46}=.76\]

The experiment is not binomial because the trials are not independent. In general, if sampling is without replacement, the experiment will not yield independent trials. If each slip had been replaced after being drawn, then trials would have been independent, but this might have resulted in the same restaurant being inspected by more than one inspector.

Suppose a state has 500,000 licensed drivers, of whom 400,000 are insured. A sample of ten drivers is chosen without replacement. The \(i\)th trial is labeled \(S\) if the \(i\)th driver chosen is insured. Although this situation would seem identical to that of Example 3.37, the important difference is that the size of the population being sampled is very large relative to the sample size. In this case

\[P(S\text{ on }2|S\text{ on }1)=\frac{399,999}{499,999}=.80000\]

and

\[P(S\text{ on }10|S\text{ on first }9)=\frac{399,991}{499,991}=.799996\approx.80000\]These calculations suggest that although the trials are not exactly independent, the conditional probabilities differ so slightly from one another that for practical purposes the trials can be regarded as independent with constant \(P(S)=.8\). Thus, to a very good approximation, the experiment is binomial with \(n=10\) and \(p=.8\). \(\blacksquare\)

We will use the following rule of thumb in deciding whether a "without-replacement" experiment can be treated as a binomial experiment.

\begin{tabular}{c c} R ULE & Consider sampling without replacement from a dichotomous population of size \(N\). If the sample size (number of trials) \(n\) is at most 5% of the population size, the experiment can be analyzed as though it were exactly a binomial experiment. \\ \end{tabular}

By "analyzed," we mean that probabilities based on the binomial experiment assumptions will be quite close to the actual "without-replacement" probabilities, which are typically more difficult to calculate. In Example 3.37, \(n/N=5/50=.1\)\(>.05\), so the binomial experiment is not a good approximation, but in Example 3.38, \(n/N=10/500,000<.05\).

### The Binomial Random Variable and Distribution

In most binomial experiments, it is the total number of \(S\)'s, rather than knowledge of exactly which trials yielded \(S\)'s, that is of interest.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & Given a binomial experiment consisting of \(n\) trials, the **binomial random variable**\(X\)** associated with this experiment is defined as \(X=\) the number of \(S\)'s among the \(n\) trials \\ \end{tabular}

Suppose, for example, that \(n=3\). Then there are eight possible outcomes for the experiment:

\(\mathit{SSS\ SSF\ SSF\ SFF\ FSS\ FFF\ FFF}\)

From the definition of \(X\), \(X(\mathit{SSF})=2\), \(X(\mathit{SFF})=1\), and so on. Possible values for \(X\) in an \(n\)-trial experiment are \(x=0\), \(1\), \(2\), \(\ldots\), \(n\). We will often write \(X\sim\mathrm{Bin}(n,p)\) to indicate that \(X\) is a binomial rv based on \(n\) trials with success probability \(p\).

\begin{tabular}{c c} NOTATION & Because the pmf of a binomial rv \(X\) depends on the two parameters \(n\) and \(p\), we denote the pmf by \(b(x;\,n,\,p)\). \\ \end{tabular}

Consider first the case \(n=4\) for which each outcome, its probability, and corresponding \(x\) value are listed in Table 3.1. For example,

\[P(SSFS) =P(S)\cdot P(S)\cdot P(F)\cdot P(S)\quad(\text{independent trials})\] \[=p\cdot p\cdot(1-p)\cdot p\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad[ \text{constant }P(S)]\] \[=p^{3}\cdot(1-p)\]

In this special case, we wish \(b(x;4,p)\) for \(x=0\), \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\). For \(b(3;4,p)\), we identify which of the \(16\) outcomes yield an \(x\) value of \(3\) and sum the probabilities associated with each such outcome:

\[b(3;4,\;p)=P(FSSS)+P(SFSS)+P(SSFS)+P(SSSF)=4p^{3}(1-p)\]

There are four outcomes with \(x=3\) and each has probability \(p^{3}(1-p)\) (the probability depends only on the number of \(S\)'s, _not_ the order of \(S\)'s and \(F\)'s), so

\[b(3;4,\;p)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}\text{number of outcomes}\\ \text{with }X=3\end{array}\right\}\cdot\left\{\begin{array}{l}\text{probability of any particular}\\ \text{outcome with }X=3\end{array}\right\}\]

Similarly, \(b(2;4,p)=6p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\), which is also the product of the number of outcomes with \(X=2\) and the probability of any such outcome.

In general,

\[b(x;\,n,\,p)=\left\{\begin{array}{l}\text{number of sequences of}\\ \text{length }n\text{ consisting of }x\text{ }S\text{'s}\end{array}\right\}\cdot \left\{\begin{array}{l}\text{probability of any}\\ \text{particular such sequence}\end{array}\right\}\]

Since the ordering of \(S\)'s and \(F\)'s is not important, the second factor in the previous equation is \(p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}\) (e.g., the first \(x\) trials resulting in \(S\) and the last \(n-x\) resulting in \(F\)). The first factor is the number of ways of choosing \(x\) of the \(n\) trials to be \(S\)'s--that is, the number of combinations of size \(x\) that can be constructed from \(n\) distinct objects (trials here).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \hline
**Outcome** & \(\boldsymbol{x}\) & **Probability** & **Outcome** & \(\boldsymbol{x}\) & **Probability** \\ \hline _SSSS_ & \(4\) & \(p^{4}_{4}\) & _FSSS_ & \(3\) & \(p^{3}(1-p)\) \\ _SSSF_ & \(3\) & \(p^{3}(1-p)\) & _FSSF_ & \(2\) & \(p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\) \\ _SSFS_ & \(3\) & \(p^{3}(1-p)\) & _FSFS_ & \(2\) & \(p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\) \\ _SSFF_ & \(2\) & \(p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\) & _FSFF_ & \(1\) & \(p(1-p)^{3}\) \\ _SFSS_ & \(3\) & \(p^{3}(1-p)\) & _FFSS_ & \(2\) & \(p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\) \\ _SFSF_ & \(2\) & \(p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\) & _FFSF_ & \(1\) & \(p(1-p)^{3}\) \\ _SFFS_ & \(2\) & \(p^{2}(1-p)^{2}\) & _FFFS_ & \(1\) & \(p(1-p)^{3}\) \\ _SFFF_ & \(1\) & \(p(1-p)^{3}\) & _FFFF_ & \(0\) & \((1-p)^{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3.1: Outcomes and probabilities for a binomial experiment with four trials
Theorem

\[b(x;n,p)=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}n\\ x\end{pmatrix}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}&x=0,1,2,\ \ldots,n\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\right.\]

Each of six randomly selected cola drinkers is given a glass containing cola \(S\) and one containing cola \(F\). The glasses are identical in appearance except for a code on the bottom to identify the cola. Suppose there is no tendency among cola drinkers to prefer one cola to the other. Then \(p=P(\text{a selected individual prefers }S)=.5\), so with \(X=\) the number among the six who prefer \(S\), \(X\sim\text{Bin}(6,.5)\).

Thus

\[P(X=3)=b(3;6,.5)=\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\ 3\end{array}\right)(.5)^{3}(.5)^{3}=20(.5)^{6}=.313\]

The probability that at least three prefer \(S\) is

\[P(3\leq X)=\sum_{x=3}^{6}b(x;6,.5)=\sum_{x=3}^{6}\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\ x\end{array}\right)(.5)^{x}(.5)^{6-x}=.656\]

and the probability that at most one prefers \(S\) is

\[P(X\leq 1)=\sum_{x=0}^{1}b(x;6,.5)=.109\]

## Using Binomial Tables

Even for a relatively small value of \(n\), the computation of binomial probabilities can be tedious. Appendix Table A.1 tabulates the cdf \(F(x)=P(X\leq x)\) for \(n=5\), \(10\), \(15\), \(20\), \(25\) in combination with selected values of \(p\). Various other probabilities can then be calculated using the proposition on cdf's from Section 3.2.

\begin{tabular}{c c} NOTATION & For \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)\), the cdf will be denoted by \\ & & \\ & & \\ \end{tabular}

Suppose that \(20\%\) of all copies of a particular textbook fail a binding strength test. Let \(X\) denote the number among \(15\) randomly selected copies that fail the test. Then \(X\) has a binomial distribution with \(n=15\) and \(p=.2\).

**1.**: The probability that at most 8 fail the test is

\[P(X\leq 8)=\sum_{y=0}^{8}b\left(y\;;\;15,.2\right)=B(8;15,.2)\]

which is the entry in the \(x=8\) row and the \(p=.2\) column of the \(n=15\) binomial table. From Appendix Table A.1, the probability is \(B(8;15,.2)=.999\).
**2.**: The probability that exactly 8 fail is

\[P(X=8)=P(X\leq 8)-P(X\leq 7)=B(8;15,.2)-B(7;15,.2)\]

which is the difference between two consecutive entries in the \(p=.2\) column. The result is \(.999-.996=.003\).
**3.**: The probability that at least 8 fail is

\[P(X\geq 8) = 1-P(X\leq 7)=1-B(7;15,.2)\] \[= 1-\left(\begin{array}{c}\mbox{entry in $x=7$ row}\\ \mbox{of $p=.2$ column}\end{array}\right)\] \[= 1-.996=.004\]
**4.**: Finally, the probability that between 4 and 7, inclusive, fail is

\[P(4\leq X\leq 7) = P(X=4,5,6,\mbox{ or }7)=\ P(X\leq 7)-P(X\leq 3)\] \[= B(7;15,2)-B(3;15,2)=.996-.648=.348\]

Notice that this latter probability is the difference between entries in the \(x=7\) and \(x=3\) rows, _not_ the \(x=7\) and \(x=4\) rows.

An electronics manufacturer claims that at most 10% of its power supply units need service during the warranty period. To investigate this claim, technicians at a testing laboratory purchase 20 units and subject each one to accelerated testing to simulate use during the warranty period. Let \(p\) denote the probability that a power supply unit needs repair during the period (the proportion of all such units that need repair). The laboratory technicians must decide whether the data resulting from the experiment supports the claim that \(p\leq.10\). Let \(X\) denote the number among the 20 sampled that need repair, so \(X\sim\mbox{Bin}(20,p)\). Consider the decision rule

\[\mbox{Reject the claim that $p\leq.10$ in favor of the conclusion that $p>.10$ if $x\geq 5$ (where $x$ is the observed value of $X$), and consider the claim plausible if $x\leq 4$.}\]

The probability that the claim is rejected when \(p=.10\) (an incorrect conclusion) is

\[P(X\geq 5\mbox{ when }\quad p=.10)=1-B(4;20,.1)=1-.957=.043\]

The probability that the claim is not rejected when \(p=.20\) (a different type of incorrect conclusion) is

\[P(X\leq 4\mbox{ when }\quad p=.2)=B(4;20,.2)=.630\]The first probability is rather small, but the second is intolerably large. When \(p=.20\), so that the manufacturer has grossly understated the percentage of units that need service, and the stated decision rule is used, 63% of all samples will result in the manufacturer's claim being judged plausible!

One might think that the probability of this second type of erroneous conclusion could be made smaller by changing the cutoff value 5 in the decision rule to something else. However, although replacing 5 by a smaller number would yield a probability smaller than.630, the other probability would then increase. The only way to make both "error probabilities" small is to base the decision rule on an experiment involving many more units. 

Note that a table entry of 0 signifies only that a probability is 0 to three significant digits, for all entries in the table are actually positive. Statistical computer packages such as MINITAB will generate either \(b(x;n,p)\) or \(B(x;n,p)\) once values of \(n\) and \(p\) are specified. In Chapter 4, we will present a method for obtaining quick and accurate approximations to binomial probabilities when \(n\) is large.

## The Mean and Variance of \(X\)

For \(n=1\), the binomial distribution becomes the Bernoulli distribution. From Example 3.17, the mean value of a Bernoulli variable is \(\mu=p\), so the expected number of \(S\)'s on any single trial is \(p\). Since a binomial experiment consists of \(n\) trials, intuition suggests that for \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,\,p)\), \(E(X)=np\), the product of the number of trials and the probability of success on a single trial. The expression for \(V(X)\) is not so intuitive.

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline Proposition \\ \hline If \(X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p)\), then \(E(X)=np\), \(V(X)=np(1-p)=npq\), and \(\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{npq}\) (where \(q=1-p\)). \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} Thus, calculating the mean and variance of a binomial rv does not necessitate evaluating summations. The proof of the result for \(E(X)\) is sketched in Exercise 74, and both the mean and the variance are obtained below using the moment generating function.

If 75% of all purchases at a store are made with a credit card and \(X\) is the number among ten randomly selected purchases made with a credit card, then \(X\sim\text{Bin}(10,\,.75)\). Thus \(E(X)=np=(10)(.75)=7.5\), \(V(X)=npq=10(.75)(.25)=1.875,\text{ and }\sigma=\sqrt{1.875}\). Again, even though \(X\) can take on only integer values, \(E(X)\) need not be an integer. If we perform a large number of independent binomial experiments, each with \(n=10\) trials and \(p=.75\), then the average number of \(S\)'s per experiment will be close to 7.5.

The Moment Generating Function of X

Let's find the moment generating function of a binomial random variable. Using the definition, \(M_{X}(t)=E(e^{tX})\),

\[M_{X}(t) = E(e^{tX})=\sum_{x\in\,D}e^{tx}p(x)=\sum_{x=0}^{n}e^{tx}{n\choose x}p^{x} (1-p)^{n-x}\] \[= \sum_{x=0}^{n}{n\choose x}(pe^{t})^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}=(pe^{t}+1-p)^{n}\]

Here we have used the binomial theorem, \(\sum_{x=0}^{n}a^{x}b^{n-x}=(a+b)^{n}\).

Notice that the mgf satisfies the property required of all moment generating functions, \(M_{X}(0)=1\), because the sum of the probabilities is 1. The mean and variance can be obtained by differentiating \(M_{X}(t)\):

\[M_{X}^{\prime}(t)=n(pe^{t}+1-p)^{n-1}pe^{t}\mbox{ and }\mu=M_{X}^{\prime}(0)=np\]

Then the second derivative is

\[M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(t)=n(n-1)(pe^{t}+1-p)^{n-2}pe^{t}pe^{t}+n(pe^{t}+1-p)^{n- 1}pe^{t}\]

and

\[E(X^{2})=M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(0)=n(n-1)p^{2}+np\]

Therefore,

\[\sigma^{2} = V(X)=E(X^{2})-\left[E(X)\right]^{2}\] \[= n(n-1)p^{2}+np-n^{2}p^{2}=np-np^{2}=np(1-p)\]

## 3 Hypergeometric and Negative Binomial Distributions

The hypergeometric and negative binomial distributions are both closely related to the binomial distribution. Whereas the binomial distribution is the approximate probability model for sampling without replacement from a finite dichotomous (\(S-F\)) population, the hypergeometric distribution is the exact probability model for the number of \(S\)'s in the sample. The binomial rv \(X\) is the number of \(S\)'s when the number \(n\) of trials is fixed, whereas the negative binomial distribution arises from fixing the number of \(S\)'s desired and letting the number of trials be random.

### The Hypergeometric Distribution

The assumptions leading to the hypergeometric distribution are as follows:

1. The population or set to be sampled consists of \(N\) individuals, objects, or elements (a _finite_ population).
2. Each individual can be characterized as a success (\(S\)) or a failure (\(F\)), and there are \(M\) successes in the population.
3. A sample of \(n\) individuals is selected without replacement in such a way that each subset of size \(n\) is equally likely to be chosen.

The random variable of interest is \(X=\) the number of \(S\)'s in the sample. The probability distribution of \(X\) depends on the parameters \(n\), \(M\), and \(N\), so we wish to obtain \(P(X=x)=h(x;\,n,\,M,\,N)\).

During a particular period a university's information technology office received 20 service orders for problems with printers, of which 8 were laser printers and 12 were inkjet models. A sample of 5 of these service orders is to be selected for inclusion in a customer satisfaction survey. Suppose that the 5 are selected in a completely random fashion, so that any particular subset of size 5 has the same chance of being selected as does any other subset (think of putting the numbers 1, 2,..., 20 on 20 identical slips of paper, mixing up the slips, and 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11412]

Five individuals from an animal population thought to be near extinction in a region have been caught, tagged, and released to mix into the population. After they have had an opportunity to mix, a random sample of ten of these animals is selected. Let \(X=\) the number of tagged animals in the second sample. If there are actually 25 animals of this type in the region, what is the probability that (a) \(X=2\)? (b) \(X\leq 2\)?

Application of the hypergeometric distribution here requires assuming that every subset of 10 animals has the same chance of being captured. This in turn implies that released animals are no easier or harder to catch than are those not initially captured. Then the parameter values are \(n=10,M=5\) (5 tagged animals in the population), and \(N=25\), so

\[h(x;\;10,\;5,\;25)=\frac{\begin{pmatrix}5\\ x\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}20\\ 10-x\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}25\\ 10\end{pmatrix}}\quad x=0,1,2,3,4,5\]

For part (a),

\[P(X=2)=h(2;10,5,25)=\frac{\begin{pmatrix}5\\ 2\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}20\\ 8\end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix}25\\ 10\end{pmatrix}}=.385\]

For part (b),

\[P(X\leq 2) =P(X=0,\;1,\;\text{or}\;2)=\sum_{x=\,0}^{2}h(x;10,5,25)\] \[=.057+.257+.385=.699\]

Comprehensive tables of the hypergeometric distribution are available, but because the distribution has three parameters, these tables require much more space than tables for the binomial distribution. MINITAB, R and other statistical software packages will easily generate hypergeometric probabilities.

As in the binomial case, there are simple expressions for \(E(X)\) and \(V(X)\) for hypergeometric rv's.

PROPOSITION The mean and variance of the hypergeometric rv \(X\) having pmf \(h(x;\,n,M,N)\) are

\[E(X)=n\cdot\frac{M}{N}\quad V(X)=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{N-n}{N-1}\end{pmatrix} \cdot n\cdot\frac{M}{N}\left(1-\frac{M}{N}\right)\]

The proof will be given in Section 6.3. We do not give the moment generating function for the hypergeometric distribution, because the mgf is more trouble than it is worth here.

The ratio _M_/_N_ is the proportion of _S_'s in the population. Replacing _M_/_N_ by \(p\) in _E_(_X_) and _V_(_X_) gives

\[\begin{array}{c} E(X)=np\\ V(X)=\left(\frac{N-n}{N-1}\right)\cdot np(1-p)\end{array} \tag{3.16}\]

Expression (3.16) shows that the means of the binomial and hypergeometric rv's are equal, whereas the variances of the two rv's differ by the factor (_N_ - _n_)/(_N_ - 1), often called the **finite population correction factor**. This factor is <1, so the hypergeometric variable has smaller variance than does the binomial rv. The correction factor can be written (1 - _n_/_N_)/(1 - 1/_N_), which is approximately 1 when \(n\) is small relative to \(N\).

In the animal-tagging example, \(n\) = 10, \(M\) = 5, and \(N\) = 25, so \(p=\frac{5}{25}=.2\) and

\[\begin{array}{c} E(X)=10(.2)=2\\ V(X)=\frac{15}{24}(10)(.2)(.8)=(.625)(1.6)=1\end{array}\]

If the sampling were carried out with replacement, _V_(_X_) = 1.6.

Suppose the population size \(N\) is not actually known, so the value \(x\) is observed and we wish to estimate \(N\). It is reasonable to equate the observed sample proportion of _S_'s, _x_/_n_, with the population proportion, _M_/_N_, giving the estimate

\[\hat{N}=\frac{M\cdot n}{x}\]

If \(M\) = 100, \(n\) = 40, and \(x\) = 16, then \(\hat{N}=250\).

Our general rule of thumb in Section 3.5 stated that if sampling is without replacement but _n_/_N_ is at most.05, then the binomial distribution can be used to compute approximate probabilities involving the number of _S_'s in the sample. A more precise statement is as follows: Let the population size, \(N\), and number of population _S_'s, \(M\), get large with the ratio _M_/_N_ approaching \(p\). Then _h_(_x_, \(n\), \(M\), _N_) approaches _b_(_x_; \(n\), _p_); so for _n_/_N_ small, the two are approximately equal provided that \(p\) is not too near either 0 or 1. This is the rationale for our rule of thumb.

### The Negative Binomial Distribution

The negative binomial rv and distribution are based on an experiment satisfying the following conditions:

1. The experiment consists of a sequence of independent trials.
2. Each trial can result in either a success (_S_) or a failure (_F_).
3. The probability of success is constant from trial to trial, so _P_(_S_ on trial _i_) = \(p\) for \(i\) = 1, 2, 3...
4. The experiment continues (trials are performed) until a total of \(r\) successes has been observed, where \(r\) is a specified positive integer.

The random variable of interest is \(X=\) the number of failures that precede the \(r\)th success, and \(X\) is called a **negative binomial random variable**. In contrast to the binomial rv, the number of successes is fixed and the number of trials is random. Why the name "negative binomial?" Binomial probabilities are related to the terms in the binomial theorem, and negative binomial probabilities are related to the terms in the binomial theorem when the exponent is a negative integer. For details see the proof for the last proposition of this section.

Possible values of \(X\) are 0, 1, 2,... Let \(nb(x;r,p)\) denote the pmf of \(X\). The event \(\{X=x\}\) is equivalent to \(\{r-1\ S\)'s in the first \((x+r-1)\) trials and an \(S\) on the \((x+r)\)th trial \(\}\) (e.g., if \(r=5\) and \(x=10\), then there must be four \(S\)'s in the first 14 trials and trial 15 must be an \(S\)). Since trials are independent,

\[\begin{array}{l}nb(x;\,r\,,\,p)=P(X=x)\\ =P(r-1\ S\,\mbox{s on the first $x+r-1$ trials})\,\cdot\,P(S)\end{array} \tag{3.17}\]

The first probability on the far right of Expression (3.17) is the binomial probability

\[\begin{array}{l}\left(\begin{array}{c}x+r-1\\ r-1\end{array}\right)p^{r-1}(1-p)^{x}\quad\mbox{where $P(S)=p$}\end{array}\]

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & The pmf of the negative binomial rv \(X\) with parameters \(r=\) number of \(S\)'s and \(p=P(S)\) is \\ & \(nb(x;r,p)=\left(\begin{array}{c}x+r-1\\ r-1\end{array}\right)p^{r}(1-p)^{x}\quad x=0,1,2,\ldots\) \\ \end{tabular}

A pediatrician wishes to recruit 5 couples, each of whom is expecting their first child, to participate in a new natural childbirth regimen. Let \(p=P(\)a randomly selected couple agrees to participate). If \(p=.2\), what is the probability that 15 couples must be asked before 5 are found who agree to participate? That is, with \(S=\{\)agrees to participate\(\}\), what is the probability that 10 \(F\)'s occur before the fifth \(S\)? Substituting \(r=5\), \(p=.2\), and \(x=10\) into \(nb(x;\,r,p)\) gives

\[nb(10;\,5,\,2)=\left(\begin{array}{c}14\\ 4\end{array}\right).2^{5}\,.8^{10}=.034\]

The probability that at most 10 \(F\)'s are observed (at most 15 couples are asked) is

\[P(X\leq 10)=\sum_{x\,=\,0}^{10}nb(x;5,2)=.2^{5}\sum_{x\,=\,0}^{10}\left( \begin{array}{c}x+4\\ 4\end{array}\right).8^{x}=.164\]

\(\blacksquare\)

In some sources, the negative binomial rv is taken to be the number of trials \(X+r\) rather than the number of failures.

In the special case \(r=1\), the pmf is

\[nb(x;1,p)=(1-p)^{x}p\quad x=0,1,2,\ldots \tag{3.18}\]

In Example 3.10, we derived the pmf for the number of trials necessary to obtain the first \(S\), and the pmf there is similar to Expression (3.18). Both \(X=\) number of \(F\)'s and \(Y=\) number of trials (\(=1\ +\ X\)) are referred to in the literature as **geometric random variables**, and the pmf in (3.18) is called the **geometric distribution**. The name is appropriate because the probabilities form a geometric series: \(p,(1-p)p,(1-p)^{2}p,\ldots.\) To see that the sum of the probabilities is \(1\), recall that the sum of a geometric series is \(a+ar+ar^{2}+\cdot\cdot\cdot=a/(1-r)\) if \(|v|<1\), so for \(p>0\),

\[p+(1-p)p+(1-p)^{2}p+\cdots=\frac{p}{1-(1-p)}=1\]

In Example 3.18, the expected number of trials until the first \(S\) was shown to be \(1/p\), so that the expected number of \(F\)'s until the first \(S\) is (\(1/p\)) \(-1=(1-p)/p\). Intuitively, we would expect to see \(r\cdot(1-p)/p\)\(F\)'s before the \(r\)th \(S\), and this is indeed \(E(X)\). There is also a simple formula for \(V(X)\).

If \(X\) is a negative binomial rv with pmf \(nb(x;r,p)\), then

\[M_{X}(t)=\frac{p^{r}}{\left[1-e^{r}(1-p)\right]^{r}}\quad E(X)=\frac{r(1-p)}{p }\quad V(X)=\frac{r(1-p)}{p^{2}}\]

ProofIn order to derive the moment generating function, we will use the binomial theorem as generalized by Isaac Newton to allow negative exponents, and this will help to explain the name of the distribution. If \(n\) is any real number, not necessarily a positive integer,

\[\left(a+b\right)^{n}=\sum_{x=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}{x}b^{x}a^{n-x}\]

where

\[\binom{n}{x}=\frac{n\cdot(n-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot(n-x+1)}{x!}\quad\text{except that }\binom{n}{0}=1\]

In the special case that \(x>0\) and \(n\) is a negative integer, \(n=-r\),

\[\binom{-r}{x} =\frac{-r\cdot(-r-1)\cdot\cdots\cdot(-r-x+1)}{x!}\] \[=\frac{(r+x-1)(r+x-2)\cdot\cdots\cdot r}{x!}(-1)^{x}=\binom{r+x-1 }{r-1}(-1)^{x}\]Using this in the generalized binomial theorem with \(a=1\) and \(b=-u\),

\[(1-u)^{-r}=\sum_{x\,=\,0}^{\infty}\binom{r+x-1}{r-1}(-1)^{x}(-u)^{x}=\sum_{x\,=\, 0}^{\infty}\binom{r+x-1}{r-1}u^{x}\]

Now we can find the moment generating function for the negative binomial distribution:

\[M_{X}(t) =\sum_{x\,=\,0}^{\infty}e^{tx}\binom{r+x-1}{r-1}p^{r}(1-p)^{x}=p^{r} \sum_{x\,=\,0}^{\infty}\binom{r+x-1}{r-1}[e^{t}(1-p)]^{x}\] \[=\frac{p^{r}}{[1-e^{t}(1-p)]^{r}}\]

The mean and variance of \(X\) can now be obtained from the moment generating function (Exercise 91). 

Finally, by expanding the binomial coefficient in front of \(p^{r}(1-p)^{x}\) and doing some cancellation, it can be seen that \(nb(x;r,p)\) is well defined even when \(r\) is not an integer. This _generalized negative binomial distribution_ has been found to fit observed data quite well in a wide variety of applications.

### 3.7 The Poisson Probability Distribution

The binomial, hypergeometric, and negative binomial distributions were all derived by starting with an experiment consisting of trials or draws and applying the laws of probability to various outcomes of the experiment. There is no simple experiment on which the Poisson distribution is based, although we will shortly describe how it can be obtained by certain limiting operations.

A random variable \(X\) is said to have a **Poisson distribution** with parameter \(l\) (_l_ = 0) if the pmf of \(X\) is \[p(x;\lambda)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x}}{x!}\quad x=0,1,2,\ldots\] \\ \end{tabular}

We shall see shortly that \(\lambda\) is in fact the expected value of \(X\), so the pmf can be written using \(\mu\) in place of \(\lambda\). Because \(\lambda\) must be positive, \(p(x;\lambda)>0\) for all possible \(x\) values. The fact that \(\sum_{x=0}^{\infty}p(x;\lambda)=1\) is a consequence of the Maclaurin infinite series expansion of \(e^{\lambda}\), which appears in most calculus texts:

\[e^{\lambda}=1+\lambda+\frac{\lambda^{2}}{2!}+\frac{\lambda^{3}}{3!}+\cdots= \sum_{x=0}^{\infty}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!} \tag{3.19}\]

If the two extreme terms in Expression (3.19) are multiplied by \(e^{-\lambda}\) and then \(e^{-\lambda}\) is placed inside the summation, the result is \[1=\sum_{x=0}^{\infty}e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!}\] which shows that \(p(x;\lambda)\) fulfills the second condition necessary for specifying a pmf.

Let \(X\) denote the number of creatures of a particular type captured in a trap during a given time period. Suppose that \(X\) has a Poisson distribution with \(\lambda=4.5\), so on average traps will contain 4.5 creatures. [The article "Dispersal Dynamics of the Bivalve _Gemma gemma_ in a Patchy Environment" (\(Ecol.\ Monogr.\), 1995: 1-20) suggests this model; the bivalve _Gemma gemma_ is a small clam.] The probability that a trap contains exactly five creatures is \[P(X=5)=e^{-4.5}\frac{\left(4.5\right)^{5}}{5!}=.1708\] The probability that a trap has at most five creatures is \[P(X\leq 5)=\sum_{x=0}^{5}e^{-4.5}\frac{\left(4.5\right)^{x}}{x!}=e^{-4.5} \bigg{[}1+4.5+\frac{4.5^{2}}{2!}+\cdots+\frac{4.5^{5}}{5!}\bigg{]}=.7029\]The Poisson Distribution as a Limit

The rationale for using the Poisson distribution in many situations is provided by the following proposition.

Suppose that in the binomial pmf \(b(x;n,p)\) we let \(n\,\rightarrow\,\infty\) and \(p\,\rightarrow\,0\) in such a way that \(np\) approaches a value \(\lambda>0\). Then \(b(x;\,n,\,p)\,\rightarrow\,p(x;\,\lambda)\).

Begin with the binomial pmf:

\[b(x;n,p) =\binom{n}{x}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}=\frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}\] \[=\frac{n\cdot(n-1)\cdot\dots\cdot(n-x+1)}{x!}p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}\]

Include \(n^{x}\) in both the numerator and denominator:

\[b(x;n,p) =\frac{n}{n}\,\frac{n-1}{n}\,\dots\,\frac{n-x+1}{n}\cdot\frac{(np)^{x}}{x!}\cdot\frac{(1-p)^{n}}{(1-p)^{x}}\]

Taking the limit as \(n\,\rightarrow\,\infty\) and \(p\,\rightarrow\,0\) with \(np\,\rightarrow\,\lambda\),

\[\lim_{n\,\rightarrow\,\infty}b(x;n,p) =1\cdot 1\cdot\dots\cdot 1\cdot\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!}\cdot\left( \lim_{n\,\rightarrow\,\infty}\frac{(1-np/n)^{n}}{1}\right)\]

The limit on the right can be obtained from the calculus theorem that says the limit of \((1\,-\,a_{n}/n)^{n}\) is \(e^{-a}\) if \(a_{n}\,\rightarrow\,a\). Because \(np\,\rightarrow\,\lambda\),

\[\lim_{n\,\rightarrow\,\infty}b(x;n,p) =\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!}\cdot\lim_{n\,\rightarrow\,\infty}\left( 1-\frac{np}{n}\right)^{n}=\frac{\lambda^{x}e^{-\lambda}}{x!}=p(x;\,\lambda)\]

It is interesting that Simeon Poisson discovered his distribution by this approach in the 1830s, as a limit of the binomial distribution. According to the proposition, _in any binomial experiment for which \(n\) is large and \(p\) is small_, \(b(x;\,n,\,p)\approx p(x;\,\lambda)\)_where \(\lambda=np\)_. As a rule of thumb, this approximation can safely be applied if \(n\,>\,50\) and \(np\,<\,5\).

If a publisher of nontechnical books takes great pains to ensure that its books are free of typographical errors, so that the probability of any given page containing at least one such error is.005 and errors are independent from page to page, what is the probability that one of its 400-page novels will contain exactly one page with errors? At most three pages with errors?

With \(S\) denoting a page containing at least one error and \(F\) an error-free page, the number \(X\) of pages containing at least one error is a binomial rv with \(n=400\) and \(p=.005\), so \(np=2\). We wish

\[P(X=1)=b(1;400,.005)\approx p(1;\,2)=\frac{e^{-2}2^{1}}{1!}=.270671\]

The binomial value is \(b(1;\,400,.005)=.270669\), so the approximation is good to five decimal places here.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11421]

Appendix Table A.2 exhibits the cdf \(F(x;\,\lambda)\) for \(\lambda=.1,.2,\,\ldots,\,1,\,2,\,\ldots,\,10\), \(15\), and \(20\). For example, if \(\lambda=2\), then \(P(X\leq 3)=F(3;\,2)=.857\) as in Example 3.48, whereas \(P(X=3)=F(3;\,2)-F(2;\,2)=.180\). Alternatively, many statistical computer packages will generate \(p(x;\,\lambda)\) and \(F(x;\,\lambda)\) upon request.

### The Mean, Variance and MGF of \(X\)

Since \(b(x;\,n,\,p)\to p(x;\,\lambda)\) as \(n\rightarrow\infty\), \(p\to 0\), \(np\rightarrow\lambda\), the mean and variance of a binomial variable should approach those of a Poisson variable. These limits are \(np\rightarrow\lambda\) and \(np(1-p)\rightarrow\lambda\).

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & If \(X\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda\), then \(E(X)=V(X)=\lambda\). \\ \end{tabular}

These results can also be derived directly from the definitions of mean and variance (see Exercise 104 for the mean).

Both the expected number of creatures trapped and the variance of the number trapped equal 4.5, and \(\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{\lambda}=\sqrt{4.5}=2.12\). \(\blacksquare\)

The moment generating function of the Poisson distribution is easy to derive, and it gives a direct route to the mean and variance (Exercise 108).

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & The Poisson moment generating function is \\  & \(M_{X}(t)=e^{\lambda(e^{\prime}-1)}\) \\ \end{tabular}

ProofThe mgf is by definition

\[M_{X}(t)=E(e^{tx})=\sum\limits_{x\,=\,0}^{\infty}e^{tx}e^{-\lambda}\frac{ \lambda^{x}}{x!}=e^{-\lambda}\sum\limits_{x\,=\,0}^{\infty}\frac{\left(\lambda e ^{\prime}\right)^{x}}{x!}=e^{-\lambda}e^{\lambda e^{\prime}}=e^{\lambda e^{ \prime}-\lambda}\]

This uses the series expansion \(\sum\limits_{x\,=\,0}^{\infty}\,u^{x}\,/\,x!=e^{\mu}\). \(\blacksquare\)

### The Poisson Process

A very important application of the Poisson distribution arises in connection with the occurrence of events of a particular type over time. As an example, suppose that starting from a time point that we label \(t=0\), we are interested in counting the number of radioactive pulses recorded by a Geiger counter. We make the following assumptions about the way in which pulses occur:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11423]

Under assumptions similar to 1-3, it can be shown that the number of events occurring in a region \(R\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\alpha\cdot a(R)\), where \(a(R)\) is the area or volume of \(R\). The quantity \(\alpha\) is the expected number of events per unit area or volume.

In particular, convergence of the binomial mgf to the Poisson mgf implies \(b(x;\,n,\,p)\to p(x;\,\,\lambda)\).

**119.**: Consider a disease whose presence can be identified by carrying out a blood test. Let \(p\) denote the probability that a randomly selected individual has the disease. Suppose \(n\) individuals are independently selected for testing. One way to proceed is to carry out a separate test on each of the \(n\) blood samples. A potentially more economical approach, group testing, was introduced during World War II to identify syphilitic men among army inductees. First, take a part of each blood sample, combine these specimens, and carry out a single test. If no one has the disease, the result will be negative, and only the one test is required. If at least one individual is diseased, the test on the combined sample will yield a positive result, in which case the \(n\) individual tests are then carried out. If \(p=.1\) and \(n=3\), what is the expected number of tests using this procedure? What is the expected number when \(n=5\)?

[_Hint_: Consider the partition with \(k = 3\) and \(A_{1} = \{F\}\), \(A_{2} = \{SS\}\), \(A_{3} = \{SF\}\).] [_Note_: It is not possible to determine \(E(X)\) directly from the definition because there is no formula for the pmf of \(X\); the complication is the word _consecutive_.]

## Chapter 6 Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions

### 6.1 Introduction

As mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 3, the two important types of random variables are discrete and continuous. In this chapter, we study the second general type of random variable that arises in many applied problems. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 present the basic definitions and properties of continuous random variables, their probability distributions, and their moment generating functions. In Section 4.3, we study in detail the normal random variable and distribution, unquestionably the most important and useful in probability and statistics. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 discuss some other continuous distributions that are often used in applied work. In Section 4.6, we introduce a method for assessing whether given sample data is consistent with a specified distribution. Section 4.7 discusses methods for finding the distribution of a transformed random variable.

## 4.1 Probability Density Functions

and Cumulative Distribution Functions

A discrete random variable (rv) is one whose possible values either constitute a finite set or else can be listed in an infinite sequence (a list in which there is a first element, a second element, etc.). A random variable whose set of possible values is an entire interval of numbers is not discrete.

Recall from Chapter 3 that a random variable \(X\) is continuous if (1) possible values comprise either a single interval on the number line (for some \(A<B\), any number \(x\) between \(A\) and \(B\) is a possible value) or a union of disjoint intervals, and (2) \(P(X=c)=0\) for any number \(c\) that is a possible value of \(X\).

If in the study of the ecology of a lake, we make depth measurements at randomly chosen locations, then \(X=\) the depth at such a location is a continuous rv. Here \(A\) is the minimum depth in the region being sampled, and \(B\) is the maximum depth. \(\blacksquare\)

If a chemical compound is randomly selected and its pH \(X\) is determined, then \(X\) is a continuous rv because any pH value between 0 and 14 is possible. If more is known about the compound selected for analysis, then the set of possible values might be a subinterval of [0, 14], such as 5.5 \(\leq x\leq\) 6.5, but \(X\) would still be continuous. \(\blacksquare\)

Let \(X\) represent the amount of time a randomly selected customer spends waiting for a haircut before his/her haircut commences. Your first thought might be that \(X\) is a continuous random variable, since a measurement is required to determine its value. However, there are customers lucky enough to have no wait whatsoever before climbing into the barber's chair. So it must be the case that \(P(X=0)>0\). Conditional on no chairs being empty, though, the waiting time will be continuous since \(X\) could then assume any value between some minimum possible time \(A\) and a maximum possible time \(B\). This random variable is neither purely discrete nor purely continuous but instead is a mixture of the two types. \(\blacksquare\)

One might argue that although in principle variables such as height, weight, and temperature are continuous, in practice the limitations of our measuring instruments restrict us to a discrete (though sometimes very finely subdivided) world. However, continuous models often approximate real-world situations very well, and continuous mathematics (the calculus) is frequently easier to work with than the mathematics of discrete variables and distributions.

## 4.2 Probability Distributions for Continuous Variables

Suppose the variable \(X\) of interest is the depth of a lake at a randomly chosen point on the surface. Let \(M=\) the maximum depth (in meters), so that any number in the interval [0, \(M\)] is a possible value of \(X\). If we "discretize" \(X\) by measuring depth to the nearest meter, then possible values are nonnegative integers less than or equal to \(M\). The resulting discrete distribution of depth can be pictured using a probability histogram. If we draw the histogram so that the area of the rectangle above any possible integer \(k\) is the proportion of the lake whose depth is (to the nearest meter) \(k\), then the total area of all rectangles is 1. A possible histogram appears in Figure 4.1(a).

If depth is measured much more accurately and the same measurement axis as in Figure 4.1(a) is used, each rectangle in the resulting probability histogram is much narrower, although the total area of all rectangles is still 1. A possible histogram is pictured in Figure 4.1(b); it has a much smoother appearance than the histogram in Figure 4.1(a). If we continue in this way to measure depth more and more finely, the resulting sequence of histograms approaches a smooth curve, as pictured in Figure 4.1(c). Because for each histogram the total area of all rectangles equals 1, the total area under the smooth curve is also 1. The probability that the depth at a randomly chosen point is between \(a\) and \(b\) is just the area under the smooth curve between \(a\) and \(b\). It is exactly a smooth curve of the type pictured in Figure 4.1(c) that specifies a continuous probability distribution.

Let \(X\) be a continuous rv. Then a **probability distribution** or **probability density function** (pdf) of \(X\) is a function \(f(x)\) such that for any two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a\leq b\),

\[P(a\leq X\leq b)=\int_{a}^{b}\!f(x)dx\]

That is, the probability that \(X\) takes on a value in the interval [\(a\), \(b\)] is the area above this interval and under the graph of the density function, as illustrated in Figure 4.2. The graph of \(f(x)\) is often referred to as the _density curve_.

Figure 4.1: (a) Probability histogram of depth measured to the nearest meter; (b) probability histogram of depth measured to the nearest centimeter; (c) a limit of a sequence of discrete histograms

For \(f(x)\) to be a legitimate pdf, it must satisfy the following two conditions:

**1. \(f(x)\geq 0\)** for all \(x\)
**2. \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=[\text{area under the entire graph of }f(x)]=1\)**

The direction of an imperfection with respect to a reference line on a circular object such as a tire, brake rotor, or flywheel is, in general, subject to uncertainty. Consider the reference line connecting the valve stem on a tire to the center point, and let \(X\) be the angle measured clockwise to the location of an imperfection. One possible pdf for \(X\) is

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{360}&0\leq x<\!\!360\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The pdf is graphed in Figure 4.3. Clearly \(f(x)\geq 0\). The area under the density curve is just the area of a rectangle: \((\text{height})(\text{base})=\left(\frac{1}{360}\right)(360)=1\). The probability that the angle is between \(90^{\circ}\) and \(180^{\circ}\) is

\[P(90\leq X\leq 180)=\int_{90}^{180}\frac{1}{360}dx=\frac{x}{360}\Big{|}_{x=90} ^{x=180}=\frac{1}{4}=.25\]

The probability that the angle of occurrence is within \(90^{\circ}\) of the reference line is

\[P(0\leq X\leq 90)+P(270\leq X<\!\!360)=.25+.25=.50\]

Because whenever \(0\leq a\leq b\leq 360\) in Example 4.4, \(P(a\leq X\leq b)\) depends only on the width \(b-a\) of the interval, \(X\) is said to have a uniform distribution.

**DEFINITION**: A continuous rv \(X\) is said to have a **uniform distribution** on the interval \([A,B]\) if the pdf of \(X\) is

\[f(x;A,B)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{B-A}&A\leq X\leq B\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Figure 4.3: The pdf and probability for Example 4.4

The graph of any uniform pdf looks like the graph in Figure 4.3 except that the interval of positive density is \([A,\,B]\) rather than \([0,\,360]\).

In the discrete case, a probability mass function (pmf) tells us how little "blobs" of probability mass of various magnitudes are distributed along the measurement axis. In the continuous case, probability density is "smeared" in a continuous fashion along the interval of possible values. When density is smeared uniformly over the interval, a uniform pdf, as in Figure 4.3, results.

When \(X\) is a discrete random variable, each possible value is assigned positive probability. This is not true of a continuous random variable (that is, the second condition of the definition is satisfied) because the area under a density curve that lies above any single value is zero:

\[P(X=c)=\int_{c}^{c}\!f(x)\,dx=\lim_{\varepsilon\,\to\,0}\,\int_{c-\varepsilon} ^{c+\varepsilon}\!f(x)\,dx=0\]

The fact that \(P(X=c)=0\) when \(X\) is continuous has an important practical consequence: The probability that \(X\) lies in some interval between \(a\) and \(b\) does not depend on whether the lower limit \(a\) or the upper limit \(b\) is included in the probability calculation:

\[P(a\leq X\leq b)=P(a<X<b)=P(a<X\leq b)=P(a\leq X<b)\]

If \(X\) is discrete and both \(a\) and \(b\) are possible values (e.g., \(X\) is binomial with \(n=20\) and \(a=5\), \(b=10\)), then all four of these probabilities are different.

The zero probability condition has a physical analog. Consider a solid circular rod with cross-sectional area \(=1\) in\({}^{2}\). Place the rod alongside a measurement axis and suppose that the density of the rod at any point \(x\) is given by the value \(f(x)\) of a density function. Then if the rod is sliced at points \(a\) and \(b\) and this segment is removed, the amount of mass removed is \(\int_{a}^{b}\!f(x)dx\); if the rod is sliced just at the point \(c\), no mass is removed. Mass is assigned to interval segments of the rod but not to individual points.

"Time headway" in traffic flow is the elapsed time between the time that one car finishes passing a fixed point and the instant that the next car begins to pass that point. Let \(X=\) the time headway for two randomly chosen consecutive cars on a freeway during a period of heavy flow. The following pdf of \(X\) is essentially the one suggested in "The Statistical Properties of Freeway Traffic" (_Transp. Res._, 11: 221-228):

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}.15e^{-.15(x-.5)}&\quad x\geq.5\\ 0&\quad\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The graph of \(f(x)\) is given in Figure 4.4; there is no density associated with headway times less than.5, and headway density decreases rapidly (exponentially fast) as \(x\) increases from.5. Clearly, \(f(x)\geq 0\); to show that \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!f(x)dx=1\) we use the calculus result \(\int_{a}^{\infty}e^{-kx}\,dx=(1/k)e^{-ka}\). Then

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!f(x)\,dx =\int_{5}^{\infty}.15e^{-.15(x-.5)}\,dx=.15e^{.075}\int_{.5}^{ \infty}e^{-.15x}\,dx\] \[=.15e^{.0The probability that headway time is at most 5 s is

\[P(X\leq 5) = \int_{-\infty}^{5}f(x)\,dx=\int_{5}^{5}.15e^{-.15(x-.5)}\,dx=.15e^{ 075}\int_{5}^{5}e^{-.15x}\,dx\] \[=.15e^{075}\cdot\frac{-1}{.15}e^{-.15x}\bigg{|}_{x=.5}^{x=5}=e^{0 75}(-e^{-.75}+e^{-.075})\] \[= 1.078(-.472+.928)=.491=P(\text{less than 5 s})=P(X{<}5)\quad\blacksquare\]

Unlike discrete distributions such as the binomial, hypergeometric, and negative binomial, the distribution of any given continuous rv cannot usually be derived using simple probabilistic arguments. Instead, one must make a judicious choice of pdf based on prior knowledge and available data. Fortunately, some general pdf families have been found to fit well in a wide variety of experimental situations; several of these are discussed later in the chapter.

Just as in the discrete case, it is often helpful to think of the population of interest as consisting of \(X\) values rather than individuals or objects. The pdf is then a model for the distribution of values in this numerical population, and from this model various population characteristics (such as the mean) can be calculated.

Several of the most important concepts introduced in the study of discrete distributions also play an important role for continuous distributions. Definitions analogous to those in Chapter 3 involve replacing summation by integration.

### The Cumulative Distribution Function

The cumulative distribution function (cdf) \(F(x)\) for a discrete rv \(X\) gives, for any specified number \(x\), the probability \(P(X\leq x)\). It is obtained by summing the pmf \(p(y)\) over all possible values \(y\) satisfying \(y\leq x\). The cdf of a continuous rv gives the same probabilities \(P(X\leq x)\) and is obtained by integrating the pdf \(f(y)\) between the limits \(-\infty\) and \(x\).

**Definition**: The **cumulative distribution function**\(F(x)\) for a continuous rv \(X\) is defined for every number \(x\) by

\[F(x)=P(X\leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(y)dy\]

For each \(x\), \(F(x)\) is the area under the density curve to the left of \(x\). This is illustrated in Figure 4.5, where \(F(x)\) increases smoothly as \(x\) increases.

Figure 4.4: The density curve for headway time in Example 4.5

Let \(X\), the thickness of a membrane, have a uniform distribution on \([A,\,B]\). The density function is shown in Figure 4.6. For \(x<A,\,F(x)=0\), since there is no area under the graph of the density function to the left of such an \(x\). For \(x\geq B,\,F(x)=1\), since all the area is accumulated to the left of such an \(x\). Finally, for \(A\leq x\leq B\),

\[F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(y)dy=\int_{A}^{x}\frac{1}{B-A}dy=\frac{1}{B-A}\cdot y \bigg{|}_{y=A}^{y=x}=\frac{x-A}{B-A}\]

The entire cdf is

\[F(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0&x<A\\ \frac{x-A}{B-A}&A\leq x<B\\ 1&x\geq B\end{array}\right.\]

The graph of this cdf appears in Figure 4.7.

Figure 4.6: The pdf for a uniform distribution

Figure 4.5: A pdf and associated cdf

Figure 4.7: The cdf for a uniform distribution

Using _F_(_x_) to Compute Probabilities

The importance of the cdf here, just as for discrete rv's, is that probabilities of various intervals can be computed from a formula or table for _F_(_x_).

Let \(X\) be a continuous rv with pdf _f_(_x_) and cdf _F_(_x_). Then for any number \(a\),

\[P(X>a)=1-F(a)\]

and for any two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a\) < \(b\),

\[P(a\leq X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a)\]

Figure 4.8 illustrates the second part of this proposition; the desired probability is the shaded area under the density curve between \(a\) and \(b\), and it equals the difference between the two shaded cumulative areas.

Suppose the pdf of the magnitude \(X\) of a dynamic load on a bridge (in newtons) is given by

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} {\frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8}x} & {0 \leq x \leq 2} \\ {0} & {\text{otherwise}} \\ \end{array} \right.\]

For any number \(x\) between 0 and 2,

\[F(x)=\int_{- \infty}^{x}f(y)dy= \int_{0}^{x}\left(\frac{1}{8} + \frac{3}{8}y\right)dy= \frac{x}{8} + \frac{3x^{2}}{16}\]

Thus

\[F(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} {0} & {x < 0} \\ {\frac{x}{8} + \frac{3x^{2}}{16}} & {0 \leq x \leq 2} \\ {1} & {2 < x} \\ \end{array} \right.\]

The graphs of _f_(_x_) and _F_(_x_) are shown in Figure 4.9. The probability that the load is between 1 and 1.5 is

\[P(1\leq X\leq 1.5)=F(1.5)-F(1) = \left[\frac{1}{8}(1.5)+\frac{3}{16}(1.5)^{2}\right]-\left[\frac{1} {8}(1)+\frac{3}{16}(1)^{2}\right]\] \[= \frac{19}{64}=.297\]

Figure 4.8: Computing _P_(_a_ ≤_X_ ≤_b_) from cumulative probabilities

The probability that the load exceeds 1 is

\[P(X>1)=1-P(X\leq 1)=1-F(1)=1-\left[\frac{1}{8}(1)+\frac{3}{16}(1)^{2}\right]= \frac{11}{16}=.688\]

Once the cdf has been obtained, any probability involving \(X\) can easily be calculated without any further integration.

### Obtaining \(f(x)\) from \(F(x)\)

For \(X\) discrete, the pmf is obtained from the cdf by taking the difference between two \(F(x)\) values. The continuous analog of a difference is a derivative. The following result is a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \\ PROPOSITION & If \(X\) is a continuous rv with pdf \(f(x)\) and cdf \(F(x)\), then at every \(x\) at which the derivative \(F^{\prime}(x)\) exists, \(F^{\prime}(x)=f(x)\). \\ \end{tabular}

When \(X\) has a uniform distribution, \(F(x)\) is differentiable except at \(x=A\) and \(x=B\), where the graph of \(F(x)\) has sharp corners. Since \(F(x)=0\) for \(x<A\) and \(F(x)=1\) for \(x>B\), \(F^{\prime}(x)=0=f(x)\) for such \(x\). For \(A<x<B\),

\[F^{\prime}(x)=\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{x-A}{B-A}\right)=\frac{1}{B-A}=f(x)\]

### Percentiles of a Continuous Distribution

When we say that an individual's test score was at the 85th percentile of the population, we mean that 85% of all population scores were below that score and 15% were above. Similarly, the 40th percentile is the score that exceeds 40% of all scores and is exceeded by 60% of all scores.

Figure 4.9: The pdf and cdf for Example 4.7

The distribution of the amount of gravel (in tons) sold by a construction supply company in a given week is a continuous rv \(X\) with pdf

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{3}{2}(1-x^{2})&0\leq x\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The cdf of sales for any \(x\) between 0 and 1 is

\[F(x)=\int_{0}^{x}\frac{3}{2}(1-y^{2})dy=\frac{3}{2}\left(y-\frac{y^{3}}{3} \right)\bigg{|}_{y=0}^{y=x}=\frac{3}{2}\left(x-\frac{x^{3}}{3}\right)\]

The graphs of both \(f(x)\) and \(F(x)\) appear in Figure 4.11. The (100\(p\))th percentile of this distribution satisfies the equation

\[p=F[\eta(p)]=\frac{3}{2}\left[\eta(p)-\frac{\left[\eta(p)\right]^{3}}{3}\right]\]

Figure 4.10: The (100\(p\))th percentile of a continuous distribution

that is,

\[\left[\eta(p)\right]^{3}-3\eta(p)+2p=0\]

For the 50th percentile, \(p=.5\), and the equation to be solved is \(\eta^{3}-3\eta+1=0\); the solution is \(\eta=\eta(.5)=.347\). If the distribution remains the same from week to week, then in the long run 50% of all weeks will result in sales of less than.347 tons and 50% in more than.347 tons.

A continuous distribution whose pdf is **symmetric**--which means that the graph of the pdf to the left of some point is a mirror image of the graph to the right of that point--has median \(\tilde{\mu}\) equal to the point of symmetry, since half the area under the curve lies to either side of this point. Figure 4.12 gives several examples. The amount of error in a measurement of a physical quantity is often assumed to have a symmetric distribution.

16. Let \(X\) be a continuous rv with cdf \[F(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}0&x\leq 0\\ \frac{x}{4}\bigg{[}1+\ln\left(\frac{4}{x}\right)\bigg{]}&0<x\leq 4\\ 1&x>4\end{array}\right.\] [This type of cdf is suggested in the article "Variability in Measured Bedload-Transport Rates" (_Water Resources Bull._, 1985:39-48) as a model for a hydrologic variable.] What is 1 2 2 Expected Values and Moment Generating Functions In Section 4.1 we saw that the transition from a discrete cdf to a continuous cdf entails replacing summation by integration. The same thing is true in moving from expected values and mgf's of discrete variables to those of continuous variables.

## Expected Values

For a discrete random variable \(X\), \(E(X)\) was obtained by summing \(x\cdot p(x)\) over possible \(X\) values. Here we replace summation by integration and the pmf by the pdf to get a continuous weighted average.

The pdf of weekly gravel sales \(X\) was (Example 4.9 continued) \[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}\frac{3}{2}(1-x^{2})&0\leq x\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]so

\[E(X) =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\cdot f(x)dx=\int_{0}^{1}x\cdot\frac{3}{2}(1 -x^{2})dx\] \[=\frac{3}{2}\int_{0}^{1}(x-x^{3})dx=\frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{x^{2}}{ 2}-\frac{x^{4}}{4}\right)\bigg{|}_{x=0}^{x=1}=\frac{3}{8}\]

If gravel sales are determined week after week according to the given pdf, then the long-run average value of sales per week will be.375 ton. 

When the pdf \(f(x)\) specifies a model for the distribution of values in a numerical population, then \(\mu\) is the population mean, which is the most frequently used measure of population location or center.

Often we wish to compute the expected value of some function \(h(X)\) of the rv \(X\). If we think of \(h(X)\) as a new rv \(Y\), methods from Section 4.7 can be used to derive the pdf of \(Y\), and \(E(Y)\) can be computed from the definition. Fortunately, as in the discrete case, there is an easier way to compute \(E[h(X)]\).

**Proposition 1**: _If \(X\) is a continuous rv with pdf \(f(x)\) and \(h(X)\) is any function of \(X\), then_

\[E[h(X)]=\mu_{h(X)}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(x)\cdot f(x)\,dx\]

_This expected value will exist provided that \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|h(x)|f(x)\,dx<\infty\)_

**Example 2**: _Two species are competing in a region for control of a limited amount of a resource. Let \(X=\) the proportion of the resource controlled by species 1 and suppose \(X\) has pdf_

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1&\quad 0\leq x\leq 1\\ 0&\quad\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

_which is a uniform distribution on [0, 1]. (In her book Ecological Diversity, E. C. Pielou calls this the "broken-stick" model for resource allocation, since it is analogous to breaking a stick at a randomly chosen point.) Then the species that controls the majority of this resource controls the amount_

\[h(X)=\max(X,1-X)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1-X&\quad\text{if}\quad\quad 0\leq X< \frac{1}{2}\\ X&\quad\text{if}\quad\quad\frac{1}{2}\leq X\leq 1\end{array}\right.\]

_The expected amount controlled by the species having majority control is then_

\[E[h(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\max(x,1-x)\cdot f(x)dx=\int_{0}^{1}\max(x,1-x)\cdot 1\ dx\] \[= \int_{0}^{1/2}(1-x)\cdot 1\ dx+\int_{1/2}^{1}x\cdot 1\ dx=\frac{3}{4}\]The Variance and Standard Deviation

The **variance** of a continuous random variable \(X\) with pdf\(f(x)\) and mean value \(\mu\) is

\[\sigma_{X}^{2}=V(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,(x-\mu)^{2}\cdot f(x)\,dx=E[(X-\mu)^ {2}]\]

The **standard deviation** (SD) of \(X\) is \(\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{V(X)}\).

As in the discrete case, \(\sigma_{X}^{2}\) is the expected or average squared deviation about the mean \(\mu\), and \(\sigma_{X}\) can be interpreted roughly as the size of a representative deviation from the mean value \(\mu\). The easiest way to compute \(\sigma^{2}\) is again to use a shortcut formula.

The derivation is similar to the derivation for the discrete case in Section 3.3.

For \(X=\) weekly gravel sales, we computed \(E(X)=\frac{3}{8}\). Since

\[E(X^{2}) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^{2}\cdot f(x)dx=\int_{0}^{1}x^{2}\cdot \frac{3}{2}(1-x^{2})dx=\frac{3}{2}\int_{0}^{1}(x^{2}-x^{4})dx=\frac{1}{5},\] \[V(X) = \frac{1}{5}-\left(\frac{3}{8}\right)^{2}=\frac{19}{320}=.059\quad \text{and}\quad\quad\sigma_{X}=.244,\]

Often in applications it is the case that \(h(X)=aX+b\), a linear function of \(X\). For example, \(h(X)=1.8X+32\) gives the transformation of temperature from the Celsius scale to the Fahrenheit scale. When \(h(X)\) is linear, its mean and variance are easily related to those of \(X\) itself, as discussed for the discrete case in Section 3.3. The derivations in the continuous case are the same. We have

\[E(aX+b)=aE(X)+b\qquad V(aX+b)=a^{2}\sigma_{X}^{2}\qquad\sigma_{aX+b}=|a|\sigma _{X}\]

When a dart is thrown at a circular target, consider the location of the landing point relative to the bull's eye. Let \(X\) be the angle in degrees measured from the horizontal, and assume that \(X\) is uniformly distributed on [0, 360]. By Exercise 23, \(E(X)=180\) and \(\sigma_{X}=360/\sqrt{12}\). Define \(Y\) to be the transformed variable \(Y=h(X)=(2\pi/360)X-\pi\), so \(Y\) is the angle measured in radians and \(Y\) is between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\). Then

\[E(Y)=\frac{2\pi}{360}E(X)-\pi=\frac{2\pi}{360}180-\pi=0.\]and

\[\sigma_{Y}=\frac{2\pi}{360}\sigma_{X}=\frac{2\pi}{360}\frac{360}{\sqrt{12}}=\frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{12}}\]

As a special case of the result \(E(aX+b)=aE(X)+b\), set \(a=1\) and \(b=-\mu\), giving \(E(X-\mu)=E(X)-\mu=0\). This can be interpreted as saying that the expected deviation from \(\mu\) is 0; \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{(x-\mu)f(x)dx}=0\). The integral suggests a physical interpretation: With \((x-\mu)\) as the lever arm and \(f(x)\) as the weight function, the total torque is 0. Using a seesaw as a model with weight distributed in accord with \(f(x)\), the seesaw will balance at \(\mu\). Alternatively, if the region bounded by the pdf curve and the \(x\)-axis is cut out of cardboard, then it will balance if supported at \(\mu\). If \(f(x)\) is symmetric, then it will balance at its point of symmetry, which must be the mean \(\mu\), assuming that the mean exists. The point of symmetry for \(X\) in Example 4.13 is 180, so it follows that \(\mu=180\). Recall from Section 4.1 that the median is also the point of symmetry, so the median of \(X\) in Example 4.13 is also 180. In general, if the distribution is symmetric and the mean exists, then it is equal to the median.

## Approximating the Mean Value and Standard Deviation

Let \(X\) be a random variable with mean value \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Then we have already seen that the new random variable \(Y=h(X)=aX+b\), a linear function of \(X\), has mean value \(a\mu+b\) and variance \(a^{2}\sigma^{2}\). But what can be said about the mean and variance of \(Y\) if \(h(x)\) is a nonlinear function? The following result is referred to as the "delta method".

\begin{tabular}{p{341.4pt} p{341.4pt}} \hline \hline PROPOSITION & Suppose \(h(x)\) is differentiable and that its derivative evaluated at \(\mu\) satisfies \(h^{\prime}(\mu)\neq 0\). Then if the variance of \(X\) is small, so that the distribution of \(X\) is largely concentrated on an interval of values close to \(\mu\), the mean value and variance of \(Y=h(X)\) can be approximated as follows: \\  & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The justification for these approximations is a first-order Taylor series expansion of \(h(X)\) about \(\mu\); that is, we approximate the function for values near \(\mu\) by the tangent line to the function at the point (\(\mu\), \(h(\mu)\)):

\[Y=h(X)\approx h(\mu)+h^{\prime}(\mu)(X-\mu)\]

Taking the expected value of this gives \(E[h(X)]\approx h(\mu)\), which validates the first part of the proposition. The variance of the linear approximation is \(V[h(X)]\approx\left[h^{\prime}(\mu)\right]^{2}\sigma_{X}^{2}\) as stated in the second part of the proposition.

A chemistry student determined the mass \(m\) and volume \(X\) of an aluminum chunk and took the ratio to obtain the density \(Y=h(X)=m\)/\(X\). The mass is measured much more accurately, so for an approximate calculation it can be regarded as a constant. The derivative of \(h(X)\) is \(-m\)/\(X^{2}\), so

\[\sigma_{Y}^{2}\approx\left[\frac{-m}{\mu_{X}^{2}}\right]^{2}\sigma_{X}^{2}\]

Taking the square root, this gives the standard deviation \(\sigma_{Y}\approx\left[m\big{/}\mu_{X}^{2}\right]\sigma_{X}\). A particular aluminum chunk had measurements \(m=18.19\) g and \(X=6.6\) cm\({}^{3}\), which gives an estimated density \(Y=m\)/\(X=18.19\)/\(6.6=2.76\). A rough value for the standard deviation \(\sigma_{X}\) is \(\sigma_{X}=.3\) cm\({}^{3}\). Our best guess for the mean of the \(X\) distribution is the measured value, so \(\mu_{Y}\approx h(\mu_{X})=18.19\)/\(6.6=2.76\), and the estimated standard deviation for the estimated density is

\[\sigma_{Y}\approx\frac{m}{\mu_{X}^{2}}\sigma_{X}=\frac{18.19}{6.6^{2}}(.3)=.125\]

Compare the estimate of 2.76, standard deviation.125, with the official value 2.70 for the density of aluminum. 

### Moment Generating Functions

Moments and moment generating functions for discrete random variables were introduced in Section 3.4. These concepts carry over to the continuous case.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & The **moment generating function** (mgf) of a continuous random variable \(X\) is \\  & \(M_{X}(t)=E\big{(}e^{tX}\big{)}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{tx}f(x)dx\). \\  & As in the discrete case, we will say that the moment generating function exists if \(M_{X}(t)\) is defined for an interval of numbers that includes zero in its interior, which means that it includes both positive and negative values of \(t\). \\ \end{tabular}

Just as before, when \(t=0\) the value of the mgf is always 1:

\[M_{X}(0)=E\big{(}e^{0X}\big{)}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{0x}f(x)dx=\int_{- \infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=1.\]

At a store the checkout time \(X\) in minutes has the pdf \(f(x)=2e^{-2x}\), \(x\geq 0\); \(f(x)=0\) otherwise. Then

\[M_{X}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{tx}f(x)dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{tx}(2e^{- 2x})dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}2e^{-(2-t)x}dx\] \[= \frac{-2}{2-t}e^{-(2-t)x}\Bigg{|}\begin{matrix}\infty\\ 0\end{matrix}=\frac{2}{2-t}\quad\text{ if }t<2.\]This mgf exists because it is defined for an interval of values including 0 in its interior.

Notice that \(M_{X}(0)=2/(2-0)=1\). Of course, from the calculation preceding this example we know that \(M_{X}(0)=1\) must always be the case, but it is useful as a check to set \(t=0\) and see if the result is 1. 

Recall that in the discrete case we had a proposition stating the uniqueness principle: The mgf uniquely identifies the distribution. This proposition is equally valid in the continuous case. Two distributions have the same pdf if and only if they have the same moment generating function, assuming that the mgf exists.

Let \(X\) be a random variable with mgf \(M_{X}(t)=2/(2-t)\), \(t<2\). Can we find the pdf \(f(x)\)? Yes, because we know from Example 4.15 that if \(f(x)=2e^{-2x}\) when \(x\geq 0\), and \(f(x)=0\) otherwise, then \(M_{X}(t)=2/(2-t)\), \(t<2\). The uniqueness principle implies that this is the only pdf with the given mgf, and therefore \(f(x)=2e^{-2x}\), \(x\geq 0\), \(f(x)=0\) otherwise. 

In the discrete case we had a theorem on how to get moments from the mgf, and this theorem applies also in the continuous case: \(E(X^{r})=M_{X}^{(r)}(0)\), the \(r\)th derivative of the mgf with respect to \(t\) evaluated at \(t=0\), if the mgf exists.

In Example 4.15 for the pdf \(f(x)=2e^{-2x}\) when \(x\geq 0\), and \(f(x)=0\) otherwise, we found \(M_{X}(t)=2/(2-t)=2{(2-t)}^{-1}\), \(t<2\). To find the mean and variance, first compute the derivatives.

\[M_{X}^{\prime}(t)= -2{(2-t)}^{-2}{(-1)}=\frac{2}{{(2-t)}^{2}}\] \[M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(t)= {(-2)}{(-2)}{(2-t)}^{-3}{(-1)}{(-1)}=\frac{4}{{(2-t)}^{3}}\]

Setting \(t\) to 0 in the first derivative gives the expected checkout time as

\[E(X)=M_{X}^{\prime}(0)=M_{X}^{(1)}(0)=.5.\]

Setting \(t\) to 0 in the second derivative gives the second moment

\[E(X^{2})=M_{X}^{\prime\prime}(0)=M_{X}^{(2)}(0)=.5.\]

The variance of the checkout time is then:

\[V(X)=\sigma^{2}=E(X^{2})-{[E(X)]}^{2}=.5-.5^{2}=.25\]

As mentioned in Section 3.4, there is another way of doing the differentiation that is sometimes more straightforward. Define \(R_{X}(t)=\ln[M_{X}(t)]\), where \(\ln(u)\) is the natural log of \(u\). Then if the moment generating function exists,

\[\mu =E(X)=R_{X}^{\prime}(0)\] \[\sigma^{2} =V(X)=R_{X}^{\prime\prime}(0)\]The derivation for the discrete case in Exercise 54 of Section 3.4 also applies here in the continuous case.

We will sometimes need to transform \(X\) using a linear function \(Y=aX+b\). As discussed in the discrete case, if \(X\) has the mgf \(M_{X}(t)\) and \(Y=aX+b\), then \(M_{Y}(t)=e^{bt}M_{X}(at)\).

Let \(X\) have a uniform distribution on the interval \([A,B]\), so its pdf is \(f(x)=1/(B-A)\), \(A\leq x\leq B;f(x)=0\) otherwise. As verified in Exercise 32, the moment generating function of \(X\) is

\[M_{X}(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{e^{Bt}-e^{At}}{(B-A)t}&t\neq 0\\ 1&t=0\end{array}\right.\]

In particular, consider the situation in Example 4.13. Let \(X\), the angle measured in degrees, be uniform on \([0,\,360]\), so \(A=0\) and \(B=360\). Then

\[M_{X}(t)=\frac{e^{360t}-1}{360t}\quad t\neq 0,\quad M_{X}(0)=1\]

Now let \(Y=(2\pi/360)X-\pi\), so \(Y\) is the angle measured in radians and \(Y\) is between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\). Using the mgf rule for linear transformations with \(a=2\pi/360\) and \(b=-\pi\), we get

\[M_{Y}(t) = e^{bt}M_{X}(at)=e^{-\pi t}M_{X}\bigg{(}\frac{2\pi}{360}t\bigg{)}\] \[= e^{-\pi t}\frac{e^{360(2\pi/360)t}-1}{360\big{(}\frac{2\pi}{360}t \big{)}}\] \[= \frac{e^{\pi t}-e^{-\pi t}}{2\pi t}\quad t\neq 0,\qquad M_{Y}(0)=1\]

This matches the general form of the moment generating function for a uniform random variable with \(A=-\pi\) and \(B=\pi\). Thus, by the uniqueness principle, \(Y\) is uniformly distributed on \([-\pi,\pi]\).

### 4.3 The Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is the most important one in all of probability and statistics. Many numerical populations have distributions that can be fit very closely by an appropriate normal curve. Examples include heights, weights, and other physical characteristics, measurement errors in scientific experiments, measurements on fossils, reaction times in psychological experiments, measurements of intelligence and aptitude, scores on various tests, and numerous economic measures and indicators. Even when the underlying distribution is discrete, the normal curve often gives an excellent approximation. In addition, even when individual variables themselves are not normally distributed, sums and averages of the variables will under suitable conditions have approximately a normal distribution; this is the content of the Central Limit Theorem discussed in Chapter 6.

#### 4.3.1 Definition

A continuous rv \(X\) is said to have a **normal distribution** with parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) (or \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\)), where \(-\infty<\mu<\infty\) and \(0<\sigma\), if the pdf of \(X\) is

\[f(x;\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}\quad -\infty<x<\infty \tag{4.3}\]

Again \(e\) denotes the base of the natural logarithm system and equals approximately 2.71828, and \(\pi\) represents the familiar mathematical constant with approximate value 3.14159. The statement that \(X\) is normally distributed with parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) is often abbreviated \(X\sim N(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})\).

Here is a proof that the normal curve satisfies the requirement \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!f(x)dx=1\) (courtesy of Professor Robert Young of Oberlin College). Consider the special case where \(\mu=0\) and \(\sigma=1\), so \(f(x)=(1/\sqrt{2\pi})e^{-x^{2}/2}\), and define \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\big{(}1/\sqrt{2\pi}\big{)}e^{-x^{2}/2}dx=A\). Let \(g(x,y)\) be the function of two variables

\[g(x,y)=f(x)\cdot f(y)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-x^{2}/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{ -y^{2}/2}=\frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2})/2}\]

Using the rotational symmetry of \(g(x,y)\), let's evaluate the volume under it by the shell method, which adds up the volumes of shells from rotation about the \(y\)-axis:

\[V=\int_{0}^{\infty}2\pi x\frac{1}{2\pi}e^{-x^{2}/2}dx=\left[-e^{-x^{2}/2} \right]_{0}^{\infty}=1\]

Now evaluate \(V\) by the usual double integral

\[V=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)f(y)dxdy=\int_{-\infty}^{ \infty}f(x)dx\cdot\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(y)dy=\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f (x)dx\right]^{2}=A^{2}\]

Because \(1=V=A^{2}\), we have \(A=1\) in this special case where \(\mu=0\) and \(\sigma=1\). How about the general case? Using a change of variables, \(z=(x-\mu)\)/\(\sigma\),

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma}e^{-(x-\mu)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2\pi}}e^{-x^{2}/2}dz=\]

It can be shown (Exercise 68) that \(E(X)=\mu\) and \(V(X)=\sigma^{2}\), so the parameters are the mean and the standard deviation of \(X\). Figure 4.13 presents graphs of \(f(x;\mu,\sigma)\) for several different (\(\mu,\sigma^{2}\)) pairs. Each resulting density curve is symmetric about \(\mu\) and bell-shaped, so the center of the bell (point of symmetry) is both the mean of the distribution and the median. The value of \(\sigma\) is the distance from \(\mu\) to the inflection points of the curve (the points at which the curve changes between turning downward to turning upward). Large values of \(\sigma\) yield density curves that are quite spread out about \(\mu\), whereas small values of \(\sigma\) yield density curves with a high peak above \(\mu\) and most of the area under the density curve quite close to \(\mu\). Thus a large \(\sigma\) implies that a value of \(X\) far from \(\mu\) may well be observed, whereas such a value is quite unlikely when \(\sigma\) is small.

The standard normal distribution does not frequently serve as a model for a naturally arising population. Instead, it is a reference distribution from which information about other normal distributions can be obtained. Appendix Table.3 gives \(\Phi(z)=P(Z\leq z)\), the area under the graph of the standard normal pdf to the left of \(z\), for \(z=-3.49\), \(-3.48\), \(\ldots\), \(3.48\), \(3.49\). Figure 4.14 illustrates the type of cumulative area (probability) tabulated in Table.3. From this table, various other probabilities involving \(Z\) can be calculated.

Figure 4.14: Standard normal cumulative areas tabulated in Appendix Table.3

Compute the following standard normal probabilities: (a) \(P(Z\leq 1.25)\), (b) \(P(Z>1.25)\), (c) \(P(Z\leq-1.25)\), and (d) \(P(-.38\leq Z\leq 1.25)\). * \(P(Z\leq 1.25)=\Phi(1.25)\), a probability that is tabulated in Appendix Table A.3 at the intersection of the row marked 1.2 and the column marked.05. The number there is.8944, so \(P(Z\leq 1.25)=.8944\). See Figure 4.15(a). * \(P(Z>1.25)=1-P(Z\leq 1.25)=1-\Phi(1.25)\), the area under the standard normal curve to the right of 1.25 (an upper-tail area). Since \(\Phi(1.25)=.8944\), it follows that \(P(Z>1.25)=.1056\). Since \(Z\) is a continuous rv, \(P(Z\geq 1.25)\) also equals.1056. See Figure 4.15(b). * \(P(Z\leq-1.25)=\Phi(-1.25)\), a lower-tail area. Directly from Appendix Table A.3, \(\Phi(-1.25)=.1056\). By symmetry of the normal curve, this is the same answer as in part (b). * \(P(-.38\leq Z\leq 1.25)\) is the area under the standard normal curve above the interval whose left endpoint is \(-.38\) and whose right endpoint is \(1.25\). From Section 4.1, if \(X\) is a continuous rv with cdf \(F(x)\), then \(P(a\leq X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a)\). This gives \(P(-.38\leq Z\leq 1.25)=\Phi(1.25)-\Phi(-.38)=.8944-.3520=.5424\). (See Figure 4.16.) 

### Percentiles of the Standard Normal Distribution

For any \(p\) between 0 and 1, Appendix Table A.3 can be used to obtain the (100\(p\))th percentile of the standard normal distribution.

The 99th percentile of the standard normal distribution is that value on the horizontal axis such that the area under the curve to the left of the value is.9900. Now Appendix Table A.3 gives for fixed \(z\) the area under the standard normal curve

Figure 4.16: \(P(-.38\leq Z\leq 1.25)\) as the difference between two cumulative areas

Figure 4.15: Normal curve areas (probabilities) for Example 4.19

to the left of \(z\), whereas here we have the area and want the value of \(z\). This is the "inverse" problem to \(P(Z\leq z)=?\) so the table is used in an inverse fashion: Find in the middle of the table.9900; the row and column in which it lies identify the 99th \(z\) percentile. Here.9901 lies in the row marked 2.3 and column marked.03, so the 99th percentile is (approximately) \(z=2.33\). (See Figure 4.17.) By symmetry, the first percentile is the negative of the 99th percentile, so it equals \(-2.33\) (1% lies below the first and above the 99th). (See Figure 4.18.)

In general, the (100\(p\))th percentile is identified by the row and column of Appendix Table A.3 in which the entry \(p\) is found (e.g., the 67th percentile is obtained by finding.6700 in the body of the table, which gives \(z=.44\)). If \(p\) does not appear, the number closest to it is often used, although linear interpolation gives a more accurate answer. For example, to find the 95th percentile, we look for.9500 inside the table. Although.9500 does not appear, both.9495 and.9505 do, corresponding to \(z=1.64\) and 1.65, respectively. Since.9500 is halfway between the two probabilities that do appear, we will use 1.645 as the 95th percentile and \(-1.645\) as the 5th percentile.

#### \(\boldsymbol{z_{\alpha}}\) Notation

In statistical inference, we will need the values on the measurement axis that capture certain small tail areas under the standard normal curve.

Figure 4.17: Finding the 99th percentile

Figure 4.18: The relationship between the 1st and 99th percentiles

\(z_{\alpha}\) will denote the value on the measurement axis for which \(\alpha\) of the area under the \(z\) curve lies to the right of \(z_{\alpha}\). (See Figure 4.19.)

For example, \(z_{.10}\) captures upper-tail area \(.10\) and \(z_{.01}\) captures upper-tail area \(.01\).

Since \(\alpha\) of the area under the standard normal curve lies to the right of \(z_{\alpha}\), \(1-\alpha\) of the area lies to the left of \(z_{\alpha}\). Thus \(z_{\alpha}\)_is the \(100(1-\alpha)\)th percentile of the standard normal distribution_. By symmetry the area under the standard normal curve to the left of \(-z_{\alpha}\) is also \(\alpha\). The \(z_{\alpha}\)'s are usually referred to as \(z\)**critical values**. Table 4.1 lists the most useful standard normal percentiles and \(z_{\alpha}\) values.

The \(100(1-.05)\)th = 95th percentile of the standard normal distribution is \(z_{.05}\), so \(z_{.05}=1.645\). The area under the standard normal curve to the left of \(-z_{.05}\) is also \(.05\). (See Figure 4.20.)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Percentile & 90 & 95 & 97.5 & 99 & 99.5 & 99.9 & 99.95 \\ \(\alpha\) (tail area) & \(.1\) & \(.05\) & \(.025\) & \(.01\) & \(.005\) & \(.001\) & \(.0005\) \\ \(z_{\alpha}=100(1-\alpha)\)th percentile & \(1.28\) & \(1.645\) & \(1.96\) & \(2.33\) & \(2.58\) & \(3.08\) & \(3.27\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Nonstandard Normal Distributions

When \(X\sim N(\mu,\,\sigma^{2})\), probabilities involving \(X\) are computed by "standardizing." The **standardized variable** is (\(X-\mu\))/\(\sigma\). Subtracting \(\mu\) shifts the mean from \(\mu\) to zero, and then dividing by \(\sigma\) scales the variable so that the standard deviation is 1 rather than \(\sigma\).

**PROPOSITION**: If \(X\) has a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\), then

\[Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\]

has a standard normal distribution. Thus

\[P(a\leq X\leq b) = P\left(\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma}\leq Z\leq\frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\] \[= \Phi\left(\frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}\right)-\Phi\left(\frac{a-\mu}{ \sigma}\right)\] \[P(X\leq a) = \Phi\left(\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\hskip 14.226378ptP(X\geq b) = 1-\Phi\left(\frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}\right)\]

The key idea of the proposition is that by standardizing, any probability involving \(X\) can be expressed as a probability involving a standard normal rv \(Z\), so that Appendix Table A.3 can be used. This is illustrated in Figure 4.21. The proposition can be proved by writing the cdf of \(Z=(X-\mu)\)/\(\sigma\) as

\[P(Z\leq z)=P(Z\leq\sigma z+\mu)=\int_{-\infty}^{\sigma z+\mu}f(x;\mu,\sigma)dy\]

Using a result from calculus, this integral can be differentiated with respect to \(z\) to yield the desired pdf \(f(z;\,0,\,1)\).

Figure 4.21: Equality of nonstandard and standard normal curve areasThe time that it takes a driver to react to the brake lights on a decelerating vehicle is critical in avoiding rear-end collisions. The article "Fast-Rise Brake Lamp as a Collision-Prevention Device" (_Ergonomics_, 1993: 391-395) suggests that reaction time for an in-traffic response to a brake signal from standard brake lights can be modeled with a normal distribution having mean value 1.25 s and standard deviation of.46 s. What is the probability that reaction time is between 1.00 and 1.75 s? If we let \(X\) denote reaction time, then standardizing gives

\[1.00\leq X\leq 1.75\]

if and only if

\[\frac{1.00-1.25}{.46}\leq\frac{x-1.25}{.46}\leq\frac{1.75-1.25}{.46}\]

Thus

\[P(1.00\leq X\leq 1.75) = P\left(\frac{1.00-1.25}{.46}\leq Z\leq\frac{1.75-1.25}{.46}\right)\] \[= P(-.54\leq Z\leq 1.09)=\Phi(1.09)-\Phi(-.54)\] \[=.8621-.2946=.5675\]

This is illustrated in Figure 4.22. Similarly, if we view 2 s as a critically long-reaction time, the probability that actual reaction time will exceed this value is

\[P(X>2)=P\left(Z>\frac{2-1.25}{.46}\right)=P(Z>1.63)=1-\Phi(1.63)=.0516\]

Standardizing amounts to nothing more than calculating a distance from the mean value and then re-expressing the distance as some number of standard deviations. For example, if \(\mu=100\) and \(\sigma=15\), then \(x=130\) corresponds to \(z=(130-100)/15=30/15=2.00\). Thus 130 is 2 standard deviations above (to the right of) the mean value. Similarly, standardizing 85 gives \((85-100)/15=-1.00\), so 85 is 1 standard deviation below the mean. The \(z\) table applies to _any_ normal distribution provided that we think in terms of number of standard deviations away from the mean value.

Figure 4.22: Normal curves for Example 4.22

The return on a diversified investment portfolio is normally distributed. What is the probability that the return is within 1 standard deviation of its mean value? This question can be answered without knowing either \(\mu\) or \(\sigma\), as long as the distribution is known to be normal; in other words, the answer is the same for _any_ normal distribution:

\[P\bigg{(}\begin{array}{c}X\text{ is within one standard}\\ \text{deviation of its mean}\end{array}\bigg{)} =P(\mu-\sigma\leq X\leq\mu+\sigma)\] \[=P\bigg{(}\frac{\mu-\sigma-\mu}{\sigma}\leq Z\leq\frac{\mu+ \sigma-\mu}{\sigma}\bigg{)}\] \[=P(-1.00\leq Z\leq 1.00)\] \[=\Phi(1.00)-\Phi(-1.00)=.6826\]

The probability that \(X\) is within 2 standard deviations of the mean is \(P(-2.00\leq Z\leq 2.00)=.9544\) and the probability that \(X\) is within 3 standard deviations of the mean is \(P(-3.00\leq Z\leq 3.00)=.9974\). 

The results of Example 4.23 are often reported in percentage form and referred to as the _empirical rule_ (because empirical evidence has shown that histograms of real data can very frequently be approximated by normal curves).

If the population distribution of a variable is (approximately) normal, then

**1.** Roughly 68% of the values are within 1 SD of the mean.

**2.** Roughly 95% of the values are within 2 SDs of the mean.

**3.** Roughly 99.7% of the values are within 3 SDs of the mean.

It is indeed unusual to observe a value from a normal population that is much farther than 2 standard deviations from \(\mu\). These results will be important in the development of hypothesis-testing procedures in later chapters.

**Percentiles of an Arbitrary Normal Distribution**

The (100\(p\))th percentile of a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) is easily related to the (100\(p\))th percentile of the standard normal distribution.

\[\begin{array}{c}(100p)\text{th percentile}\\ \text{for normal}(\mu,\sigma)\end{array}=\mu+\bigg{[}\begin{array}{c}(100p) \text{th percentile}\\ \text{for standard normal}\end{array}\bigg{]}\cdot\sigma\]

Another way of saying this is that if \(z\) is the desired percentile for the standard normal distribution, then the desired percentile for the normal (\(\mu\), \(\sigma\)) distribution is \(z\) standard deviations from \(\mu\). For justification, see Exercise 65.

The amount of distilled water dispensed by a machine is normally distributed with mean value 64 oz and standard deviation.78 oz. What container size \(c\) will ensure that overflow occurs only.5% of the time? If \(X\) denotes the amount dispensed, the desired condition is that \(P(X>c)=.005\), or, equivalently, that \(P(X\leq c)=.995\). Thus \(c\) is the 99.5th percentile of the normal distribution with \(\mu=64\) and \(\sigma=.78\). The 99.5th percentile of the standard normal distribution is 2.58, so

\[c=\eta(.995)=64+(2.58)(.78)=64+2.0=66\text{ oz}\]

This is illustrated in Figure 4.23.

## The Normal Distribution and Discrete Populations

The normal distribution is often used as an approximation to the distribution of values in a discrete population. In such situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that probabilities are computed in an accurate manner.

IQ (as measured by a standard test) is known to be approximately normally distributed with \(\mu=100\) and \(\sigma=15\). What is the probability that a randomly selected individual has an IQ of at least 125? Letting \(X=\) the IQ of a randomly chosen person, we wish \(P(X\geq 125)\). The temptation here is to standardize \(X\geq 125\) immediately as in previous examples. However, the IQ population is actually discrete, since IQs are integer-valued, so the normal curve is an approximation to a discrete probability histogram, as pictured in Figure 4.24.

Figure 4.24: A normal approximation to a discrete distribution

Figure 4.23: Distribution of amount dispensed for Example 4.24

The rectangles of the histogram are _centered_ at integers, so IQs of at least 125 correspond to rectangles beginning at 124.5, as shaded in Figure 4.24. Thus we really want the area under the approximating normal curve to the right of 124.5. Standardizing this value gives \(P(Z\geq 1.63)=.0516\). If we had standardized \(X\geq 125\), we would have obtained \(P(Z\geq 1.67)=.0475\). The difference is not great, but the answer.0516 is more accurate. Similarly, \(P(X=125)\) would be approximated by the area between 124.5 and 125.5, since the area under the normal curve above the single value 125 is zero.

The correction for discreteness of the underlying distribution in Example 4.25 is often called a **continuity correction**. It is useful in the following application of the normal distribution to the computation of binomial probabilities. The normal distribution was actually created as an approximation to the binomial distribution (by Abraham De Moivre in the 1730s).

### Approximating the Binomial Distribution

Recall that the mean value and standard deviation of a binomial random variable \(X\) are \(\mu_{X}=np\) and \(\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{npq}\), respectively. Figure 4.25 displays a probability histogram for the binomial distribution with \(n=20\), \(p=.6\) [so \(\mu=20(.6)=12\) and \(\sigma=\sqrt{20(.6)(.4)}=2.19\)]. A normal curve with mean value and standard deviation equal to the corresponding values for the binomial distribution has been superimposed on the probability histogram. Although the probability histogram is a bit skewed (because \(p\neq.5\)), the normal curve gives a very good approximation, especially in the middle part of the picture. The area of any rectangle (probability of any particular \(X\) value) except those in the extreme tails can be accurately approximated by the corresponding normal curve area. Thus \(P(X=10)=B(10;\,20,\,.6)\)\(-\)\(B(9;\,20,\,.6)=.117\), whereas the area under the normal curve between 9.5 and 10.5 is \(P(-1.14\leq Z\leq-.68)=.120\).

More generally, as long as the binomial probability histogram is not too skewed, binomial probabilities can be well approximated by normal curve areas. It is then customary to say that \(X\) has approximately a normal distribution.

Figure 4.25: Binomial probability histogram for \(n=20\), \(p=.6\) with normal approximation curve superimposed

If either _np_ < 10 or _nq_ < 10, the binomial distribution may be too skewed for the (symmetric) normal curve to give accurate approximations.

Suppose that 25% of all licensed drivers in a state do not have insurance. Let \(X\) be the number of uninsured drivers in a random sample of size 50 (somewhat perversely, a success is an uninsured driver), so that \(p\) =.25. Then \(m\) = 12.5 and \(s\) = 3.062. Since _np_ = 50(.25) = 12.5 >= 10 and _nq_ = 37.5 >= 10, the approximation can safely be applied:

\[P(X \leq 10) = B(10;50,.25) \approx \Phi\left( \frac{10 +.5 - 12.5}{3.062} \right) = \Phi( -.65) =.2578\]

Similarly, the probability that between 5 and 15 (inclusive) of the selected drivers are uninsured is

\[P(5 \leq X \leq 15) = B(15;50,.25) - B(4;50,.25) \approx \Phi\left( \frac{15.5 - 12.5}{3.062} \right) - \Phi\left( \frac{4.5 - 12.5}{3.062} \right) =.8320\]

The exact probabilities are.2622 and.8348, respectively, so the approximations are quite good. In the last calculation, the probability _P_(5 <= \(X\) <= 15) is being approximated by the area under the normal curve between 4.5 and 15.5--the continuity correction is used for both the upper and lower limits.

When the objective of our investigation is to make an inference about a population proportion \(p\), interest will focus on the sample proportion of successes _X_/_n_ rather than on \(X\) itself. Because this proportion is just \(X\) multiplied by the constant 1/_n_, it will also have approximately a normal distribution (with mean \(m\) = \(p\) and standard deviation \(\sigma = \sqrt{pq/n}\)) provided that both _np_ >= 10 and _nq_ >= 10. This normal approximation is the basis for several inferential procedures to be discussed in later chapters.

It is quite difficult to give a direct proof of the validity of this normal approximation (the first one goes back about 270 years to de Moivre). In Chapter 6, we'll see that it is a consequence of an important general result called the Central Limit Theorem.

The Normal Moment Generating Function

The moment generating function provides a straightforward way to verify that the parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) are indeed the mean and variance of \(X\) (Exercise 68).

PROPOSITION

The moment generating function of a normally distributed random variable \(X\) is

\[M_{X}(t)=e^{\mu t+\sigma^{2}t/2}\]

**Proof** Consider first the special case of a standard normal rv \(Z\). Then

\[M_{Z}(t)=E(e^{tZ})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{tz}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-z^{2} /2}dz=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(z^{2}-2tz)/2}dz\]

Completing the square in the exponent, we have

\[M_{Z}(t)=e^{t^{2}/2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(z^{2}-2tz+ t^{2})/2}dz=e^{t^{2}/2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-(z-t)^{2} /2}dz\]

The last integral is the area under a normal density with mean \(t\) and standard deviation \(1\), so the value of the integral is \(1\). Therefore, \(M_{z}(t)=e^{t^{2}/2}\).

Now let \(X\) be any normal rv with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). Then, by the first proposition in this section, \((X-\mu)/\sigma=Z\), where \(Z\) is standard normal. That is, \(X=\mu+\sigma Z\). Now use the property \(M_{aY+b}(t)=e^{bt}M_{Y}(at)\):

\[M_{X}(t)=M_{\mu+\sigma Z}(t)=e^{\mu t}M_{Z}(\sigma t)=e^{\mu t}e^{\sigma^{2}t^ {2}/2}=e^{\mu t+\sigma^{2}t^{2}/2}\]

43. If \(X\) is a normal rv with mean 80 and standard deviation 10, compute the following probabilities by standardizing: **a.**\(P(X\leq 100)\) **b.**\(P(X\leq 80)\) **c.**\(P(65\leq X\leq 100)\) **d.**\(P(70\leq X)\) **e.**\(P(85\leq X\leq 95)\) **f.**\(P(1X-801\leq 10)\)

54. A machine that produces ball bearings has initially been set so that the true average diameter of the bearings it produces is.500 in. A bearing is acceptable if its diameter is within.004 in. of this target value. Suppose, however, that the setting has changed during the course of production, so that the bearings have normally distributed diameters with mean value.499 in. and standard deviation.002 in. What percentage of the bearings produced will not be acceptable?
55. The Rockwell hardness of a metal is determined by impressing a hardened point into the surface of the metal and then measuring the depth of penetration of the point. Suppose the Rockwell hardness of an alloy is normally distributed with mean 70 and standard deviation 3. (Rockwell hardness is measured on a continuous scale.) **a.**: If a specimen is acceptable only if its hardness is between 67 and 75, what is the probability that a randomly chosen specimen has an acceptable hardness? **b.**: If the acceptable range of hardness is (70 - \(c\), 70 + _c_), for what value of \(c\) would 95% of all specimens have acceptable hardness? **c.**: If the acceptable range is as in part (a) and the hardness of each of ten randomly selected specimens is independently determined, what is the expected number of acceptable specimens among the ten? **d.**: What is the probability that at most 8 of 10 independently selected specimens have a hardness of less than 73.84? [_Hint_: \(Y=\) the number among the ten specimens with hardness less than 73.84 is a binomial variable; what is _p_?]
56. The weight distribution of parcels sent in a certain manner is normal with mean value 12 lb and standard deviation 3.5 lb. The parcel service wishes to establish a weight value \(c\) beyond which there will be a surcharge. What value of c is such that 99% of all parcels are at least 1 lb under the surcharge weight?
57. Suppose Appendix Table A.3 contained \(\Phi(z)\) only for \(z\geq 0\). Explain how you could still compute **a.**: \(P(-1.72\leq Z\leq-.55)\) **b.**: \(P(-1.72\leq Z\leq.55)\) **b.**: Is it necessary to table \(\Phi(z)\) for \(z\) negative? What property of the standard normal curve justifies your answer?
58. Consider babies born in the "normal" range of 37-43 weeks of gestational age. Extensive data supports the assumption that for such babies born in the United States, birth weight is normally distributed with mean 3432 g and standard deviation 482 g. [The article "Are Babies Normal?" (_Amer. Statist._, 1999: 298-302) analyzed data from a particular year. A histogram with a sensible choice of class intervals did not look at all normal, but further investigation revealed this was because some hospitals measured weight in grams and others measured to the nearest ounce and then converted to grams. Modifying the class intervals to allow for this gave a histogram that was well described by a normal distribution.] **a.**: What is the probability that the birth weight of a randomly selected baby of this type exceeds 4000 g? Is between 3000 and 4000 g? **b.**: What is the probability that the birth weight of a randomly selected baby of this type is either less than 2000 g or greater than 5000 g? **c.**: What is the probability that the birth weight of a randomly selected baby of this type exceeds 7 lb? **d.**: How would you characterize the most extreme.1% of all birth weights? **e.**: If \(X\) is a random variable with a normal distribution and \(a\) is a numerical constant (\(a\neq 0\)), then \(Y=aX\) also has a normal distribution. Use this to determine the distribution of birth weight expressed in pounds (shape, mean, and standard deviation), and then recalculate the probability from part (c). How does this compare to your previous answer?
59. In response to concerns about nutritional contents of fast foods, McDonald's announced that it would use a new cooking oil for its french fries that would decrease substantially trans fatty acid levels and increase the amount of more beneficial polyunsaturated fat. The company claimed that 97 out of 100 people cannot detect a difference in taste between the new and old oils. Assuming that this figure is correct (as a long-run proportion), what is the approximate probability that in a random sample of 1,000 individuals who have purchased fries at McDonald's, **a.**: At least 40 can taste the difference between the two oils? **b.**: At most 5% can taste the difference between the two oils?60. Chebyshev's inequality, introduced in Exercise 43 (Chapter 3), is valid for continuous as well as discrete distributions. It states that for any number \(k\) satisfying \(k\geq 1\), \(P(|X-\mu|\geq k\sigma)\leq 1/k^{2}\). (see Exercise 43 in Section 3.3 for an interpretation and Exercise 135 in Chapter 3 Supplementary Exercises for a proof). Obtain this probability in the case of a normal distribution for \(k=1\), \(2\), and \(3\), and compare to the upper bound.

[_Hint_: Write the cdf of \(Y\), \(P(Y\leq y)\), as an integral involving the pdf of \(X\), and then differentiate with respect to \(y\) to get the pdf of \(Y\).] **b.** If when measured in \({}^{\circ}\)C, temperature is normally distributed with mean 115 and standard deviation 2, what can be said about the distribution of temperature measured in \({}^{\circ}\)F?
67. There is no nice formula for the standard normal cdf \(\Phi(z)\), but several good approximations have been published in articles. The following is from "Approximations for Hand Calculators Using Small Integer Coefficients" (_Math. Comput._, 1977: 214-222). For \(0<z\leq 5.5\), \[P(Z\geq z)=1-\Phi(z)\] \[\approx.5\ \exp\biggl{\{}-\biggl{[}\frac{(83z+351)z+562}{(703/z)+16 5}\biggr{]}\biggr{\}}\] The relative error of this approximation is less than \(.042\%\). Use this to calculate approximations to the following probabilities, and compare whenever possible to the probabilities obtained from Appendix Table A.3. **a.**\(P(Z\geq 1)\) **b.**\(P(Z<-3)\) **c.**\(P(-4<Z<4)\) **d.**\(P(Z>5)\)
68. The moment generating function can be used to find the mean and variance of the normal distribution. **a.** Use derivatives of \(M_{X}(t)\) to verify that \(E(X)=\mu\) and \(V(X)=\sigma^{2}\). **b.** Repeat (a) using \(R_{X}(t)=\ln[M_{X}(t)]\), and compare with part (a) in terms of effort.

## 4.4 The Gamma Distribution and Its Relatives

The graph of any normal pdf is bell-shaped and thus symmetric. In many practical situations, the variable of interest to the experimenter might have a skewed distribution. A family of pdf's that yields a wide variety of skewed distributional shapes is the gamma family. To define the family of gamma distributions, we first need to introduce a function that plays an important role in many branches of mathematics.

**Definition** : For \(\alpha>0\), the **gamma function**\(\Gamma(\alpha)\) is defined by

\[\Gamma(\alpha)=\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x}dx \tag{4.5}\]

The most important properties of the gamma function are the following:

**1.**: For any \(\alpha>1\), \(\Gamma(\alpha)=(\alpha-1)\cdot\Gamma(\alpha-1)\) (via integration by parts)
**2.**: For any positive integer, \(n\), \(\Gamma(n)=(n-1)!\)
**3.**: \(\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=\sqrt{\pi}\)

By Expression (4.5), if we let

\[f(x;\alpha)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x}}{\Gamma(\alpha) }&x>0\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right. \tag{4.6}\]

then \(f(x;\ \alpha)\geq 0\) and \(\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x;\alpha)dx=\Gamma(\alpha)/\Gamma(\alpha)=1\), so \(f(x;\ \alpha)\) satisfies the two basic properties of a pdf.

**The Family of Gamma Distributions**

**Definition** : A continuous random variable \(X\) is said to have a **gamma distribution** if the pdf of \(X\) is

\[f(x;\alpha,\beta)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma( \alpha)}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x/\beta}&x>0\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right. \tag{4.7}\]

where the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) satisfy \(\alpha>0\), \(\beta>0\). The **standard gamma distribution** has \(\beta=1\), so the pdf of a standard gamma rv is given by (4.6).

**Proposition** : The moment generating function of a gamma random variable is

\[M_{X}(t)=\frac{1}{\left(1-\beta t\right)^{\alpha}}\]

**Proof** By definition, the mgf is

\[M_{X}(t)=E(e^{xX})=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{x}\frac{x^{x-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{2}} \,e^{-x/\beta}dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{x-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{2}}\,e^{- x(-t+1/\beta)}dx\]

One way to evaluate the integral is to express the integrand in terms of a gamma density. This means writing the exponent in the form \(-x/b\) and having \(b\) take the place of \(\beta\). We have \(-x(-t+1/\beta)=-x[(-\beta t+1)/\beta]=-x[\beta/(1-\beta t)]\). Now multiplying and at the same time dividing the integrand by \(1/(1-\beta t)^{x}\) gives

\[M_{X}(t)=\frac{1}{(1-\beta t)^{x}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{x-1}}{\Gamma( \alpha)[\beta/(1-\beta t)]^{x}}e^{-x/[\beta/(1-\beta t)]}dx\]

But now the integrand is a gamma pdf, so it integrates to 1. This establishes the result.

The mean and variance can be obtained from the moment generating function (Exercise 80), but they can also be obtained directly through integration (Exercise 81).

**PROPOSITION** The mean and variance of a random variable \(X\) having the gamma distribution \(f(x;\,\alpha,\,\beta)\) are

\[E(X)=\mu=\alpha\beta\hskip 28.452756ptV(X)=\sigma^{2}=\alpha\beta^{2}\]

When \(X\) is a standard gamma rv, the cdf of \(X\), which is

\[F(x;\alpha)=\int_{0}^{x}\!\frac{y^{x-1}e^{-y}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}dy\quad x>0 \tag{4.8}\]

is called the **incomplete gamma function** [sometimes the incomplete gamma function refers to Expression (4.8) without the denominator \(\Gamma(\alpha)\) in the integrand].

Figure 4.26: **(a) Gamma density curves; (b) standard gamma density curves**There are extensive tables of \(F(x;\alpha)\) available; in Appendix Table A.4, we present a small tabulation for \(\alpha=1\), \(2\),..., \(10\) and \(x=1\), \(2\),..., \(15\).

Suppose the reaction time \(X\) of a randomly selected individual to a certain stimulus has a standard gamma distribution with \(\alpha=2\). Since

\[P(a\leq X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a)\]

when \(X\) is continuous,

\[P(3\leq X\leq 5)=F(5;2)-F(3;2)=.960-.801=.159\]

The probability that the reaction time is more than \(4\) s is

\[P(X>4)=1-P(X\leq 4)=1-F(4;2)=1-.908=.092\]

The incomplete gamma function can also be used to compute probabilities involving nonstandard gamma distributions.

Let \(X\) have a gamma distribution with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). Then for any \(x>0\), the cdf of \(X\) is given by

\[P(X\leq x)=F(x;\alpha,\beta)=F\bigg{(}\frac{x}{\beta};\alpha\bigg{)}\]

the incomplete gamma function evaluated at \(x/\beta\).1

Footnote 1: MINITAB, R and other statistical packages calculate \(F(x;\alpha,\beta)\) once values of \(x\), \(\alpha\), and \(\beta\) are specified.

**Proof** Calculate, with the help of the substitution \(y=u/\beta\),

\[P(X\leq x)=\int_{0}^{x}\frac{u^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{2}}e^{-u/\beta }du=\int_{0}^{x/\beta}\frac{y^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}e^{-y}dy=F\bigg{(} \frac{x}{\beta};\alpha\bigg{)}\]

Suppose the survival time \(X\) in weeks of a randomly selected male mouse exposed to \(240\) rads of gamma radiation has a gamma distribution with \(\alpha=8\) and \(\beta=15\). (Data in _Survival Distributions: Reliability Applications in the Biomedical Services_, by A. J. Gross and V. Clark, suggests \(\alpha\approx 8.5\) and \(\beta\approx 13.3\).) The expected survival time is \(E(X)=(8)(15)=120\) weeks, whereas \(V(X)=(8)(15)^{2}=1\),\(800\) and \(\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{1800=42.43}\) weeks. The probability that a mouse survives between \(60\) and \(120\) weeks is

\[P(60\leq X\leq 120) =P(X\leq 120)-P(X\leq 60)\] \[=F(120/15;8)-(60/5;8)\] \[=F(8;8)-F(4;8)=.547-.051=.496\]The probability that a mouse survives at least 30 weeks is

\[P(X\geq 30) = 1-P(X<30)=1-P(X\leq 30)\] \[= 1-F(30/15;8)=.999\]

### The Exponential Distribution

The family of exponential distributions provides probability models that are widely used in engineering and science disciplines.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & \(X\) is said to have an **exponential distribution** with parameter \(\lambda\) (\(\lambda>0\)) if the pdf of \(X\) is \\  & \(f(x;\lambda)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}&x\geq 0\\ 0&\text{otherwise.}\end{array}\right.\) \\ \end{tabular}  (4.9)

The exponential pdf is a special case of the general gamma pdf (4.7) in which \(\alpha=1\) and \(\beta\) has been replaced by \(1/\lambda\) [some authors use the form \((1/\beta)e^{-x/\beta}\)]. The mean and variance of \(X\) are then

\[\mu=\alpha\beta=\frac{1}{\lambda}\qquad\qquad\sigma^{2}=\alpha\beta^{2}=\frac {1}{\lambda^{2}}\]

Both the mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution equal \(1/\lambda\). Graphs of several exponential pdf's appear in Figure 4.27.

Figure 4.27: Exponential density curves

Unlike the general gamma pdf, the exponential pdf can be easily integrated. In particular, the cdf of \(X\) is

\[F(x;\lambda)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}0&x<0\\ 1-e^{-\lambda x}&x\geq 0\end{array}\right.\]

The response time \(X\) at an on-line computer terminal (the elapsed time between the end of a user's inquiry and the beginning of the system's response to that inquiry) has an exponential distribution with expected response time equal to 5 s. Then \(E(X)=1/\lambda=5\), so \(\lambda=.2\). The probability that the response time is at most 10 s is

\[P(X\leq 10)=F(10;.2)=1-e^{-(.2)(10)}=1-e^{-2}=1-.135=.865\]

The probability that response time is between 5 and 10 s is

\[P(5\leq X\leq 10)=F(10;.2)-F(5;.2)=\left(1-e^{-2}\right)-\left(1-e^{-1}\right)=.233\quad\blacksquare\]

The exponential distribution is frequently used as a model for the distribution of times between the occurrence of successive events, such as customers arriving at a service facility or calls coming in to a switchboard. The reason for this is that the exponential distribution is closely related to the Poisson process discussed in Chapter 3.

\begin{tabular}{p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{p{142.3pt}}{} & \multicolumn{1}{p{142.

Another important application of the exponential distribution is to model the distribution of component lifetime. A partial reason for the popularity of such applications is the "**memoryless**" **property** of the exponential distribution. Suppose component lifetime is exponentially distributed with parameter \(l\). After putting the component into service, we leave for a period of \(t\)0 h and then return to find the component still working; what now is the probability that it lasts at least an additional \(t\) hours? In symbols, we wish _P_(_X_ >= \(t\) + \(t\)0|_X_ >= \(t\)0). By the definition of conditional probability,

\[P(X \geq t + t_{0}\,|\,X \geq t_{0}) = \frac{P[(X \geq t + t_{0})\cap(X \geq t_{0})]}{P(X \geq t_{0})}\]

But the event \(X\) >= \(t\)0 in the numerator is redundant, since both events can occur if and only if \(X\) >= \(t\) + \(t\)0. Therefore,

\[P(X \geq t + t_{0}\,|\,X \geq t_{0}) = \frac{P(X \geq t + t_{0})}{P(X \geq t_{0})} = \frac{1 - F(t + t_{0};\,\lambda)}{1 - F(t_{0};\,\lambda)} = \frac{e^{- \lambda(t + t_{0})}}{e^{- \lambda t_{0}}} = e^{- \lambda t}\]

This conditional probability is identical to the original probability _P_(_X_ >= _t_) that the component lasted \(t\) hours. Thus _the distribution of additional lifetime is exactly the same as the original distribution of lifetime_, so at each point in time the component shows no effect of wear. In other words, the distribution of remaining lifetime is independent of current age.

Although the memoryless property can be justified at least approximately in many applied problems, in other situations components deteriorate with age or occasionally improve with age (at least up to a certain point). More general lifetime models are then furnished by the gamma, Weibull, and lognormal distributions (the latter two are discussed in the next section).

## The Chi-Squared Distribution

The chi-squared distribution is important because it is the basis for a number of procedures in statistical inference. The reason for this is that chi-squared distributions are intimately related to normal distributions (see Exercise 79). We will discuss the chi-squared distribution in more detail in Section 6.4 and the chapters on inference.

## 4.5 Other Continuous Distributions

The normal, gamma (including exponential), and uniform families of distributions provide a wide variety of probability models for continuous variables, but there are many practical situations in which no member of these families fits a set of observed data very well. Statisticians and other investigators have developed other families of distributions that are often appropriate in practice.

### The Weibull Distribution

The family of Weibull distributions was introduced by the Swedish physicist Waloddi Weibull in 1939; his 1951 article "A Statistical Distribution Function of Wide Applicability" (\(J.\,Appl.\,Mech.\), 18: 293-297) discusses a number of applications.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & A random variable \(X\) is said to have a **Weibull distribution** with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) (\(\alpha>0\), \(\beta>0\)) if the pdf of \(X\) is \\  & \\ \end{tabular}  (4.11)In some situations there are theoretical justifications for the appropriateness of the Weibull distribution, but in many applications _f_(_x_; \(a\), _b_) simply provides a good fit to observed data for particular values of \(a\) and \(b\). When \(a\) = 1, the pdf reduces to the exponential distribution (with \(l\) = 1/_b_), so the exponential distribution is a special case of both the gamma and Weibull distributions. However, there are gamma distributions that are not Weibull distributions and vice versa, so one family is not a subset of the other. Both \(a\) and \(b\) can be varied to obtain a number of different distributional shapes, as illustrated in Figure 4.28. Note that \(b\) is a scale parameter, so different values stretch or compress the graph in the _x_-direction.

Integrating to obtain _E_(_X_) and _E_(_X_2) yields

\[\mu = \beta \Gamma \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha } \right)\sigma^{2} = \beta^{2} \left\{ \Gamma \left( 1 + \frac{2}{\alpha } \right) - \left[ \Gamma \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha } \right) \right]^{2} \right\}\]

Figure 4.28: Weibull density curves

The computation of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) thus necessitates using the gamma function.

The integration \(\int_{0}^{x}f(y;\alpha,\beta)dy\) is easily carried out to obtain the cdf of \(X\). The cdf of a Weibull rv having parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is

\[F(x;\alpha,\beta)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}0&x<0\\ 1-e^{-(x/\beta)^{*}}&x\geq 0\end{array}\right. \tag{4.12}\]

In recent years the Weibull distribution has been used to model engine emissions of various pollutants. Let \(X\) denote the amount of NO\({}_{x}\) emission (g/gal) from a randomly selected four-stroke engine of a certain type, and suppose that \(X\) has a Weibull distribution with \(\alpha=2\) and \(\beta=10\) (suggested by information in the article "Quantification of Variability and Uncertainty in Lawn and Garden Equipment NO\({}_{x}\) and Total Hydrocarbon Emission Factors," _J. Air Waste Manag_. _Assoc._, 2002: 435-448). The corresponding density curve looks exactly like the one in Figure 4.28 for \(\alpha=2\), \(\beta=1\) except that now the values 50 and 100 replace 5 and 10 on the horizontal axis (because \(\beta\) is a "scale parameter"). Then

\[P(X\leq 10)=F(10;2,10)=1-e^{-(10/10)^{2}}=1-e^{-1}=.632\]

Similarly, \(P(X\leq 25)=.998\), so the distribution is almost entirely concentrated on values between 0 and 25. The value \(c\), which separates the 5% of all engines having the largest amounts of NO\({}_{x}\) emissions from the remaining 95%, satisfies

\[.95=1-e^{-(c/10)^{2}}\]

Isolating the exponential term on one side, taking logarithms, and solving the resulting equation gives \(c\approx 17.3\) as the 95th percentile of the emission distribution.

Frequently, in practical situations, a Weibull model may be reasonable except that the smallest possible \(X\) value may be some value \(\gamma\) not assumed to be zero (this would also apply to a gamma model). The quantity \(\gamma\) can then be regarded as a third parameter of the distribution, which is what Weibull did in his original work. For, say, \(\gamma=3\), all curves in Figure 4.28 would be shifted 3 units to the right. This is equivalent to saying that \(X-\gamma\) has the pdf (4.11), so that the cdf of \(X\) is obtained by replacing \(x\) in (4.12) by \(x-\gamma\).

An understanding of the volumetric properties of asphalt is important in designing mixtures that will result in high-durability pavement. The article "Is a Normal Distribution the Most Appropriate Statistical Distribution for Volumetric Properties in Asphalt Mixtures" _J. of Testing and Evaluation_, Sept. 2009: 1-11 used the analysis of some sample data to recommend that for a particular mixture, \(X=\) air void volume (%) be modeled with a three-parameter Weibull distribution. Suppose the values of the parameters are \(\gamma=4\), \(\alpha=1.3\), and \(\beta=.8\) (quite close to estimates given in the article).

For \(x\geq 4\), the cumulative distribution function is

\[F(x;\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=F(x;1.3,.8,4)=1-e^{-[(x-4)/\beta]^{1.3}}\]The probability that the air void volume of a specimen is between 5% and 6% is

\[P(5\leq X\leq 6) = F(6;1.3,.8,4)-F(5;1.3,.8,4)=e^{-[(5-4)/.8]^{1.3}}-e^{-[(6-4)/.8]^{1.3}}\] \[=.263-.037=.226\qed\]

### The Lognormal Distribution

Lognormal distributions have been used extensively in engineering, medicine, and more recently, finance.

**Definition**: A nonnegative rv \(X\) is said to have a **lognormal distribution** if the rv \(Y=\ln(X)\) has a normal distribution. The resulting pdf of a lognormal rv when \(\ln(X)\) is normally distributed with parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) is

\[f(x;\mu,\sigma)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi} \sigma x}e^{-[\ln(x)-\mu]^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}&x\geq 0\\ 0&x<0\end{array}\right.\]

Be careful here; the parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) are not the mean and standard deviation of \(X\) but of \(\ln(X)\). The mean and variance of \(X\) can be shown to be

\[E(X)=e^{\mu+\sigma^{2}/2}\hskip 28.452756ptV(X)=e^{2\mu+\sigma^{2}}\cdot(e^{ \sigma^{2}}-1)\]

In Chapter 6, we will present a theoretical justification for this distribution in connection with the Central Limit Theorem, but as with other distributions, the lognormal can be used as a model even in the absence of such justification. Figure 4.29 illustrates graphs of the lognormal pdf; although a normal curve is symmetric, a lognormal curve has a positive skew.

Figure 4.29: Lognormal density curves

Because \(\ln(X)\) has a normal distribution, the cdf of \(X\) can be expressed in terms of the cdf \(\Phi(z)\) of a standard normal rv \(Z\). For \(x\geq 0\),

\[\begin{split} F(x;\mu,\sigma)&=P(X\leq x)=P[\ln(X) \leq\ln(x)]=P\bigg{[}\frac{\ln(X)-\mu}{\sigma}\leq\frac{\ln(x)-\mu}{\sigma} \bigg{]}\\ &=P\bigg{[}Z\leq\frac{\ln(x)-\mu}{\sigma}\bigg{]}=\Phi\bigg{[} \frac{\ln(x)-\mu}{\sigma}\bigg{]}\end{split} \tag{4.13}\]

According to the article "Predictive Model for Fitting Corrosion in Buried Oil and Gas Pipelines" (_Corrosion_, 2009: 332-342), the lognormal distribution has been reported as the best option for describing the distribution of maximum pit depth data from cast iron pipes in soil. The authors suggest that a lognormal distribution with \(\mu=.353\) and \(\sigma=.754\) is appropriate for maximum pit depth (mm) of buried pipelines. For this distribution, the mean value and variance of pit depth are

\[\begin{split} E(X)&=e^{.353+(.754)^{2}/2}=e^{.6383} =1.893\\ V(X)&=e^{2(.353)+(.754)^{2}}\cdot(e^{(.754)^{2}}-1)=( 3.57697)(.765645)=2.7387\end{split}\]

The probability that maximum pit depth is between 1 and 2 mm is

\[\begin{split} P(1\leq X\leq 2)&=P(\ln(1)\leq\ln(X)\leq\ln(2))\\ &=P(0\leq\ln(X)\leq.693)\\ &=P\bigg{(}\frac{0-.353}{.754}\leq Z\leq\frac{.693-.353}{.754}\bigg{)} \\ &=\Phi(.45)-\Phi(-.47)=.354\end{split}\]

What value \(c\) is such that only 1% of all specimens have a maximum pit depth exceeding \(c\)? The desired value satisfies

\[.99=P(X\leq c)=P\bigg{(}Z\leq\frac{\ln(c)-.353}{.754}\bigg{)}\]

The \(z\) critical value 2.33 captures an upper-tail area of.01 (\(z_{.01}=2.33\)), and thus a cumulative area of.99. This implies that

\[\frac{\ln(c)-.353}{.754}=2.33\]

from which \(\ln(c)=2.1098\) and \(c=8.247\). Thus 8.247 is the 99th percentile of the maximum pit depth distribution. 

## The Beta Distribution

All families of continuous distributions discussed so far except for the uniform distribution have positive density over an infinite interval (although typically the density function decreases rapidly to zero beyond a few standard deviations from the mean). The beta distribution provides positive density only for \(X\) in an interval of finite length.

A random variable \(X\) is said to have a **beta distribution** with parameters \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) (both positive), \(A\), and \(B\) if the pdf of \(X\) is

\[f(x;\alpha,\beta,A,B)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{B-A}\cdot\frac{\Gamma( \alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\cdot\Gamma(\beta)}\left(\frac{x-A}{B-A}\right)^{ \alpha-1}\left(\frac{B-x}{B-A}\right)^{\beta-1}&A\leq x\leq B\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The case \(A=0\), \(B=1\) gives the **standard beta distribution**.

Figure 4.30 illustrates several standard beta pdf's. Graphs of the general pdf are similar, except they are shifted and then stretched or compressed to fit over \([A,B]\). Unless \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are integers, integration of the pdf to calculate probabilities is difficult, so either a table of the incomplete beta function or software is generally used.

The mean and variance of \(X\) are

\[\mu=A+(B-A)\cdot\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\hskip 28.452756pt\sigma^{2}=\frac{(B-A)^{2}\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^{2}(\alpha+\beta+1)}\]

Project managers often use a method labeled PERT--for program evaluation and review technique--to coordinate the various activities making up a large project. (One successful application was in the construction of the _Apollo_ spacecraft.) A standard assumption in PERT analysis is that the time necessary to complete any particular activity once it has been started has a beta distribution with \(A=\) the optimistic time (if everything goes well) and \(B=\) the pessimistic time (if everything goes badly). Suppose that in constructing a single-family house, the time \(X\) (in days) necessary for laying the foundation has a beta distribution with \(A=2\), \(B=5\), \(\alpha=2\), and \(\beta=3\). Then \(\alpha/(\alpha+\beta)=.4\), so \(E(X)=2+(3)(.4)=3.2\).

Figure 4.30: Standard beta density curves

For these values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), the pdf of \(X\) is a simple polynomial function. The probability that it takes at most 3 days to lay the foundation is

\[P(X\leq 3) =\int_{2}^{3}\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{4!}{1!\cdot 2!}\left(\frac{x-2}{3 }\right)\left(\frac{5-x}{3}\right)^{2}dx\] \[=\frac{4}{27}\int_{2}^{3}\left(x-2\right)(5-x)^{2}dx=\frac{4}{27} \cdot\frac{11}{4}=\frac{11}{27}=.407\]

The standard beta distribution is commonly used to model variation in the proportion or percentage of a quantity occurring in different samples, such as the proportion of a 24-h day that an individual is asleep or the proportion of a certain element in a chemical compound.

## Chapter 4 Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions

### 4.1 Probability Plots

An investigator will often have obtained a numerical sample \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) and wish to know whether it is plausible that it came from a population distribution of some particular type (e.g., from a normal distribution). For one thing, many formal procedures from statistical inference are based on the assumption that the population distribution is of a specified type. The use of such a procedure is inappropriate if the actual underlying probability distribution differs greatly from the assumed type. Also, understanding the underlying distribution can sometimes give insight into the physical mechanisms involved in generating the data. An effective way to check a distributional assumption is to construct what is called a **probability plot**. The essence of such a plot is that if the distribution on which the plot is based is correct, the points in the plot will fall close to a straight line. If the actual distribution is quite different from the one used to construct the plot, the points should depart substantially from a linear pattern.

### 4.2 Sample Percentiles

The details involved in constructing probability plots differ a bit from source to source. The basis for our construction is a comparison between percentiles of the sample data and the corresponding percentiles of the distribution under consideration. Recall that the (100\(p\))th percentile of a continuous distribution with \(\text{cdf}\,F(x)\) is the number \(\eta(p)\) that satisfies \(F[\eta(p)]=p\). That is, \(\eta(p)\) is the number on the measurement scale such that the area under the density curve to the left of \(\eta(p)\) is \(p\). Thus the 50th percentile \(\eta(.5)\) satisfies \(F[\eta(.5)]=.5\), and the 90th percentile satisfies \(F[\eta(.9)]=.9\). Consider as an example the standard normal distribution, for which we have denoted the cdf by \(\Phi(z)\). From Appendix 4.3, we find the 20th percentile by locating the row and column in which.2000 (or a number as close to it as possible) appears inside the table. Since.2005 appears at the intersection of the \(-.8\) row and the.04 column, the 20th percentile is approximately \(-.84\). Similarly, the 25th percentile of the standard normal distribution is (using linear interpolation) approximately \(-.675\).

Roughly speaking, sample percentiles are defined in the same way that percentiles of a population distribution are defined. The 50th-sample percentile should separate the smallest 50% of the sample from the largest 50%, the 90th percentile should be such that 90% of the sample lies below that value and 10% lies above, and so on. Unfortunately, we run into problems when we actually try to compute the sample percentiles for a particular sample of \(n\) observations. If, for example, \(n=10\), we can split off 20% of these values or 30% of the data, but there is no value that will split off exactly 23% of these ten observations. To proceed further, we need an operational definition of sample percentiles (this is one place where different people do slightly different things). Recall that when \(n\) is odd, the sample median or 50th-sample percentile is the middle value in the ordered list, for example, the sixth largest value when \(n=11\). This amounts to regarding the middle observation as being half in the lower half of the data and half in the upper half. Similarly, suppose \(n=10\). Then if we call the third smallest value the 25th percentile, we are regarding that value as being half in the lower group (consisting of the two smallest observations) and half in the upper group (the seven largest observations). This leads to the following general definition of sample percentiles.

Order the \(n\) sample observations from smallest to largest. Then the _i_th smallest observation in the list is taken to be the [**100(_i_ -.5)/_n_**]th sample percentile**.

Once the percentage values 100(_i_ -.5)/_n_ (_i_ = 1, 2, \(\ldots\), _n_) have been calculated, sample percentiles corresponding to intermediate percentages can be obtained by linear interpolation. For example, if \(n\) = 10, the percentages corresponding to the ordered observations are 100(1 -.5)/10 = 5%, 100(2 -.5)/10 = 15%, 25%, \(\ldots\), and 100(10 -.5)/10 = 95%. The 10th percentile is then halfway between the 5th percentile (smallest sample observation) and the 15th percentile (second smallest observation). For our purposes, such interpolation is not necessary because a probability plot will be based only on the percentages 100(_i_ -.5)/_n_ corresponding to the \(n\) sample observations.

### A Probability Plot

Suppose now that for percentages 100(_i_ -.5)/_n_ (_i_ = 1, \(\ldots\), _n_) the percentiles are determined for a specified population distribution whose plausibility is being investigated. If the sample was actually selected from the specified distribution, the sample percentiles (ordered sample observations) should be reasonably close to the corresponding population distribution percentiles. That is, for \(i\) = 1, 2, \(\ldots\), \(n\) there should be reasonable agreement between the _i_th smallest sample observation and the [100(_i_ -.5)/_n_]th percentile for the specified distribution. Consider the (population percentile, sample percentile) pairs--that is, the pairs

\[\left(\begin{array}{l} {[100(i -.5)/n]\text{th percentile}} \\ {\text{of the distribution}} \\ \end{array} \right),\quad i\text{th smallest sample}\]

for \(i\) = 1, \(\ldots\), \(n\). Each such pair can be plotted as a point on a two-dimensional coordinate system. If the sample percentiles are close to the corresponding population distribution percentiles, the first number in each pair will be roughly equal to the second number. The plotted points will then fall close to a 45\({}^{\circ}\) line. Substantial deviations of the plotted points from a 45\({}^{\circ}\) line suggest that the assumed distribution might be wrong.

The value of a physical constant is known to an experimenter. The experimenter makes \(n\) = 10 independent measurements of this value using a measurement device and records the resulting measurement errors (error = observed value - true value). These observations appear in the accompanying table.

Is it plausible that the random variable _measurement error_ has a standard normal distribution? The needed standard normal (\(z\)) percentiles are also displayed in the table. Thus the points in the probability plot are (\(-1.645\), \(-1.91\)), (\(-1.037\), \(-1.25\)), \(\ldots\), and (1.645, 1.56). Figure 4.31 shows the resulting plot. Although the points deviate a bit from the \(45^{\circ}\) line, the predominant impression is that this line fits the points very well. The plot suggests that the standard normal distribution is a reasonable probability model for measurement error.

Figure 4.32 shows a plot of pairs (\(z\) percentile, observation) for a second sample of ten observations. The \(45^{\circ}\) line gives a good fit to the middle part of the sample but not to the extremes. The plot has a well-defined S-shaped appearance. The two smallest sample observations are considerably larger than the corresponding \(z\) percentiles (the points on the far left of the plot are well above the \(45^{\circ}\) line).

Figure 4.31: Plots of pairs (\(z\) percentile, observed value) for the data of Example 4.35: first sample

Figure 4.32: Plots of pairs (\(z\) percentile, observed value) for the data of Example 4.35: second sample

Similarly, the two largest sample observations are much smaller than the associated \(z\) percentiles. This plot indicates that the standard normal distribution would not be a plausible choice for the probability model that gave rise to these observed measurement errors. 

An investigator is typically not interested in knowing whether a specified probability distribution, such as the standard normal distribution (normal with \(\mu = 0\) and \(\sigma = 1\)) or the exponential distribution with \(\lambda =.1\), is a plausible model for the population distribution from which the sample was selected. Instead, the investigator will want to know whether _some_ member of a family of probability distributions specifies a plausible model--the family of normal distributions, the family of exponential distributions, the family of Weibull distributions, and so on. The values of the parameters of a distribution are usually not specified at the outset. If the family of Weibull distributions is under consideration as a model for lifetime data, the issue is whether there are _any_ values of the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) for which the corresponding Weibull distribution gives a good fit to the data. Fortunately, it is almost always the case that just one probability plot will suffice for assessing the plausibility of an entire family. If the plot deviates substantially from a straight line, no member of the family is plausible. When the plot is quite straight, further work is necessary to estimate values of the parameters (e.g., find values for \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\)) that yield the most reasonable distribution of the specified type.

Let's focus on a plot for checking normality. Such a plot can be very useful in applied work because many formal statistical procedures are appropriate (give accurate inferences) only when the population distribution is at least approximately normal. These procedures should generally not be used if the normal probability plot shows a very pronounced departure from linearity. The key to constructing an omnibus normal probability plot is the relationship between standard normal (\(z\)) percentiles and those for any other normal distribution:

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{percentile for a normal}\\ (\mu,\sigma)\mbox{ distribution}\end{array}=\mu+\sigma\cdot(\mbox{corresponding $z$ percentile})\]

Consider first the case \(\mu=0\). Then if each observation is exactly equal to the corresponding normal percentile for a particular value of \(\sigma\), the pairs (\(\sigma\cdot[z\) percentile], observation) fall on a 45\({}^{\circ}\) line, which has slope 1. This implies that the pairs (\(z\) percentile, observation) fall on a line passing through (0, 0) (i.e., one with \(y\)-intercept 0) but having slope \(\sigma\) rather than 1. The effect of a nonzero value of \(\mu\) is simply to change the \(y\)-intercept from 0 to \(\mu\).

A plot of the \(n\) pairs

\[([100(i-.5)/n]\mbox{th $z$ percentile},i\mbox{th smallest observation})\]

on a two-dimensional coordinate system is called a **normal probability plot**. If the sample observations are in fact drawn from a normal distribution with mean value \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\), the points should fall close to a straight line with slope \(\sigma\) and intercept \(\mu\). Thus a plot for which the points fall close to some straight line suggests that the assumption of a normal population distribution is plausible.

The accompanying sample consisting of \(n=20\) observations on dielectric breakdown voltage of a piece of epoxy resin appeared in the article "Maximum Likelihood Estimation in the 3-Parameter Weibull Distribution" (_IEEE Trans. Dielectrics Electr. Insul._, 1996: 43-55). Values of (\(i-.5\))/\(n\) for which \(z\) percentiles are needed are (1 \(-.5\))/20 \(=.025\), (2 \(-.5\))/20 \(=.075\), \(\ldots\), and \(.975\).

\[\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}\mathit{Observation}&24.46&25.61&26.25&26.42&26.6 6&27.15&27.31&27.54&27.74&27.94\\ \mathit{z}\,\mathit{percentile}&-1.96&-1.44&-1.15&-.93&-.76&-.60&-.45&-.32&-.19 &-.06\\ \mathit{Observation}&27.98&28.04&28.28&28.49&28.50&28.87&29.11&29.13&29.50&30.88\\ \mathit{z}\,\mathit{percentile}&.06&.19&.32&.45&.60&.76&.93&1.15&1.44&1.96\\ \end{array}\]

Figure 4.33 shows the resulting normal probability plot. The pattern in the plot is quite straight, indicating it is plausible that the population distribution of dielectric breakdown voltage is normal.

There is an alternative version of a normal probability plot in which the \(z\) percentile axis is replaced by a nonlinear probability axis. The scaling on this axis is constructed so that plotted points should again fall close to a line when the sampled distribution is normal. Figure 4.34 shows such a plot from MINITAB for the breakdown voltage data of Example 4.36. Here the \(z\) values are replaced by the corresponding normal percentiles. The plot remains the same, and it is just the labeling of the axis that changes. Note that MINITAB and various other software packages use the refinement (\(i-.375\))/(\(n+.25\)) of the formula (\(i-.5\))/\(n\) in order to get a better approximation to what is expected for the ordered values of the standard normal distribution. Also notice that the axes in Figure 4.34 are reversed relative to those in Figure 4.33.

Figure 4.33: Normal probability plot for the dielectric breakdown voltage sample

A nonnormal population distribution can often be placed in one of the following three categories:

**1.**: It is symmetric and has "lighter tails" than does a normal distribution; that is, the density curve declines more rapidly out in the tails than does a normal curve.
**2.**: It is symmetric and heavy-tailed compared to a normal distribution.
**3.**: It is skewed.

A uniform distribution is light-tailed, since its density function drops to zero outside a finite interval. The density function \(f(x)=1/[\pi(1+x^{2})]\), for \(-\infty<x<\infty\), is one example of a heavy-tailed distribution, since \(1/(1+x^{2})\) declines much less rapidly than does \(e^{-x^{2}/2}\). Lognormal and Weibull distributions are among those that are skewed. When the points in a normal probability plot do not adhere to a straight line, the pattern will frequently suggest that the population distribution is in a particular one of these three categories.

If the sample is selected from a light-tailed distribution, the largest and smallest observations are usually not as extreme as would be expected from a normal random sample. Visualize a straight line drawn through the middle part of the plot; points on the far right tend to be below the line (observed value \(<z\) percentile), whereas points on the left end of the plot tend to fall above the straight line (observed value \(>z\) percentile). The result is an S -shaped pattern of the type pictured in Figure 4.32.

A sample from a heavy-tailed distribution also tends to produce an S-shaped plot. However, in contrast to the light-tailed case, the left end of the plot curves downward (observed \(<z\) percentile), as shown in Figure 4.35(a). If the underlying distribution is positively skewed (a short left tail and a long right tail), the smallest sample observations will be larger than expected from a normal sample and so will the largest observations. In this case, points on both ends of the plot will fall above a

straight line through the middle part, yielding a curved pattern, as illustrated in Figure 4.35(b). A sample from a lognormal distribution will usually produce such a pattern. A plot of [\(z\) percentile, \(\ln(x)\)] pairs should then resemble a straight line.

Even when the population distribution is normal, the sample percentiles will not coincide exactly with the theoretical percentiles because of sampling variability. How much can the points in the probability plot deviate from a straight-line pattern before the assumption of population normality is no longer plausible? This is not an easy question to answer. Generally speaking, a small sample from a normal distribution is more likely to yield a plot with a nonlinear pattern than is a large sample. The book _Fitting Equations to Data_ (see the Chapter 12 bibliography) presents the results of a simulation study in which numerous samples of different sizes were selected from normal distributions. The authors concluded that there is typically greater variation in the appearance of the probability plot for sample sizes smaller than 30, and only for much larger sample sizes does a linear pattern generally predominate. When a plot is based on a small sample size, only a very substantial departure from linearity should be taken as conclusive evidence of nonnormality. A similar comment applies to probability plots for checking the plausibility of other types of distributions.

Given the limitations of probability plots, there is need for an alternative. In Section 13.2 we introduce a formal procedure for judging whether the pattern of points in a normal probability plot is far enough from linear to cast doubt on population normality.

### 13 Beyond Normality

Consider a family of probability distributions involving two parameters, \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\), and let \(F(x;\,\theta_{1},\,\theta_{2})\) denote the corresponding cdf's. The family of normal distributions is one such family, with \(\theta_{1}=\mu\), \(\theta_{2}=\sigma\), and \(F(x;\mu,\sigma)=\Phi[(x-\mu)/\sigma]\). Another example is the Weibull family, with \(\theta_{1}=\alpha\), \(\theta_{2}=\beta\), and

\[F(x;\alpha,\beta)=1-e^{-(x/\beta)^{\alpha}}\]

Figure 4.35: Probability plots that suggest a nonnormal distribution: (a) a plot consistent with a heavytailed distribution; (b) a plot consistent with a positively skewed distribution

Still another family of this type is the gamma family, for which the cdf is an integral involving the incomplete gamma function that cannot be expressed in any simpler form.

The parameters \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\) are said to be **location** and **scale parameters**, respectively, if \(F(x;\,\theta_{1},\,\theta_{2})\) is a function of \((x-\,\theta_{1})/\,\theta_{2}\). The parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) of the normal family are location and scale parameters, respectively. Changing \(\mu\) shifts the location of the bell-shaped density curve to the right or left, and changing \(\sigma\) amounts to stretching or compressing the measurement scale (the scale on the horizontal axis when the density function is graphed). Another example is given by the cdf

\[F(x;\theta_{1},\theta_{2})=1-e^{-e^{(x-\theta_{1})/\theta_{2}}}\qquad\quad-\infty<x<\infty\]

A random variable with this cdf is said to have an _extreme value distribution_. It is used in applications involving component lifetime and material strength.

Although the form of the extreme value cdf might at first glance suggest that \(\theta_{1}\) is the point of symmetry for the density function, and therefore the mean and median, this is not the case. Instead, \(P(X\leq\theta_{1})=F(\theta_{1};\,\,\theta_{1},\,\,\theta_{2})=1-e^{-1}=.632\), and the density function _f_(\(x;\,\theta_{1},\,\theta_{2})=F^{\prime}(x;\,\theta_{1},\,\theta_{2})\) is negatively skewed (a long lower tail). Similarly, the scale parameter \(\theta_{2}\) is not the standard deviation (\(\mu=\theta_{1}-.5772\theta_{2}\) and \(\sigma=1.283\theta_{2}\)). However, changing the value of \(\theta_{1}\) does change the location of the density curve, whereas a change in \(\theta_{2}\) rescales the measurement axis.

The parameter \(\beta\) of the Weibull distribution is a scale parameter, but \(\alpha\) is not a location parameter. The parameter \(\alpha\) is usually referred to as a **shape parameter**. A similar comment applies to the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) of the gamma distribution. In the usual form, the density function for any member of either the gamma or Weibull distribution is positive for \(x>0\) and zero otherwise. A location parameter can be introduced as a third parameter \(\gamma\) (we did this for the Weibull distribution) to shift the density function so that it is positive if \(x>\gamma\) and zero otherwise.

When the family under consideration has only location and scale parameters, the issue of whether any member of the family is a plausible population distribution can be addressed via a single, easily constructed probability plot. One first obtains the percentiles of the _standard distribution_, the one with \(\theta_{1}=0\) and \(\theta_{2}=1\), for percentages \(100(i-.5)/n\) (\(i=1\), \(\ldots\), \(n\)). The \(n\) (standardized percentile, observation) pairs give the points in the plot. This is, of course, exactly what we did to obtain an omnibus normal probability plot. Somewhat surprisingly, this methodology can be applied to yield an omnibus Weibull probability plot. The key result is that if \(X\) has a Weibull distribution with shape parameter \(\alpha\) and scale parameter \(\beta\), then the transformed variable ln(\(X\)) has an extreme value distribution with location parameter \(\theta_{1}=\) ln(\(\beta\)) and scale parameter \(\alpha\). Thus a plot of the [extreme value standardized percentile, ln(\(x\))] pairs that shows a strong linear pattern provides support for choosing the Weibull distribution as a population model.

The accompanying observations are on lifetime (in hours) of power apparatus insulation when thermal and electrical stress acceleration were fixed at particular values ("On the Estimation of Life of Power Apparatus Insulation Under CombinedElectrical and Thermal Stress," _IEEE Trans. Electr. Insul._, 1985: 70-78). A Weibull probability plot necessitates first computing the 5th, 15th, \(\ldots\), and 95th percentiles of the standard extreme value distribution. The (100\(p\))th percentile \(\eta(p)\) satisfies

\[p=F[\eta(p)]=1-e^{-e^{\zeta(p)}}\]

from which \(\eta(p)=\ln[-\ln(1-p)]\).

\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r} _Percentile_ & \(-2.97\) & \(-1.82\) & \(-1.25\) & \(-.84\) & \(-.51\) \\ \hline \(x\) & 282 & 501 & 741 & 851 & 1,072 \\ \hline \(ln(x)\) & 5.64 & 6.22 & 6.61 & 6.75 & 6.98 \\ _Percentile_ & \(-.23\) &.05 &.33 &.64 & 1.10 \\ \hline \(x\) & 1,122 & 1,202 & 1,585 & 1,905 & 2,138 \\ \hline \(ln(x)\) & 7.02 & 7.09 & 7.37 & 7.55 & 7.67 \\ \end{tabular}

The pairs (\(-2.97\), 5.64), (\(-1.82\), 6.22), \(\ldots\), (1.10, 7.67) are plotted as points in Figure 4.36. The straightness of the plot argues strongly for using the Weibull distribution as a model for insulation life, a conclusion also reached by the author of the cited article.

The gamma distribution is an example of a family involving a shape parameter for which there is no transformation \(h(x)\) such that \(h(X)\) has a distribution that depends only on location and scale parameters. Construction of a probability plot necessitates first estimating the shape parameter from sample data (some methods for doing this are described in Chapter 7).

Sometimes an investigator wishes to know whether the transformed variable \(X^{\theta}\) has a normal distribution for some value of \(\theta\) (by convention, \(\theta=0\) is identified with the logarithmic transformation, in which case \(X\) has a lognormal distribution). The book _Graphical Methods for Data Analysis_, listed in the Chapter 1 bibliography, discusses this type of problem as well as other refinements of probability plotting.

Suppose we believe that the observations come from a distribution with mean 0, and let \(w_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(w_{n}\) be the _ordered absolute_ values of the \(x_{i}\)'s. A **half-normal plot** is a probability plot of the \(w_{i}\)'s. More specifically, since \(P(|Z|\leq w)=P(-w\leq Z\leq w)=2\Phi(w)-1\), a half-normal plot is a plot of the \((\Phi^{-1}[(p_{i}+1)/2]\), \(w_{i})\) pairs, where \(p_{i}=(i-.5)/n\).

## 4.7 Transformations of a Random Variable

Often we need to deal with a transformation \(Y=g(X)\) of the random variable \(X\). Here \(g(X)\) could be a simple change of time scale. If \(X\) is in hours and \(Y\) is in minutes, then \(Y=60X\). What happens to the pdf when we do this? Can we get the pdf of \(Y\) from the pdf of \(X\)? Consider first a simple example.

The interval \(X\) in minutes between calls to a 911 center is exponentially distributed with mean 2 min, so has pdf \(f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-x/2}\) for \(x>0\). Can we find the pdf of \(Y=60X\), so \(Y\) is the number of seconds? In order to get the pdf, we first find the cdf. The cdf of \(Y\) is

\[F_{Y}(y) =P(Y\leq y)=P(60X\leq y)=P(X\leq y/60)=F_{X}(y/60)\] \[=\int_{0}^{y/60}\frac{1}{2}e^{-u/2}du=1-e^{-y/120}.\]

Differentiating this with respect to \(y\) gives \(f_{Y}(y)=(1/120)e^{-y/120}\) for \(y>0\). The distribution of \(Y\) is exponential with mean 120 s (2 min).

Sometimes it isn't possible to evaluate the cdf in closed form. Could we still find the pdf of \(Y\) without evaluating the integral? Yes, and it involves differentiating the integral with respect to the upper limit of integration. The rule, which is sometimes presented as part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, is

\[\frac{d}{dx}\int_{q}^{x}h(u)du=h(x).\]Now, setting \(x=y/60\) and using the chain rule, we get the pdf using the rule for differentiating integrals:

\[f_{Y}(y) = \left.\frac{d}{dy}F_{Y}(y)=\frac{d}{dy}F_{X}(x)\right|_{x=y/60}= \frac{dx}{dy}\frac{d}{dx}F_{X}(x)\right|_{x=y/60}\] \[= \left.\frac{1}{60}\frac{d}{dx}\int_{0}^{x}\frac{1}{2}e^{-u/2}du= \frac{1}{60}\cdot\frac{1}{2}e^{-x/2}=\frac{1}{120}\ e^{-y/120}\right.\]

Although it is useful to have the integral expression of the cdf here for clarity, it is not necessary. A more abstract approach is just to use differentiation of the cdf to get the pdf. That is, with \(x=y/60\) and again using the chain rule,

\[f_{Y}(y) = \left.\frac{d}{dy}F_{Y}(y)=\frac{d}{dy}F_{X}(x)\right|_{x=y/60}= \frac{dx}{dy}\frac{d}{dx}F_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{60}f_{X}(x)\] \[= \frac{1}{60}\cdot\frac{1}{2}e^{-x/2}=\frac{1}{120}\ e^{-y/120} \ \ y>0.\]

Is it plausible that, if \(X\sim\) exponential with mean 2, then \(60X\sim\) exponential with mean 120? In terms of time between calls, if it is exponential with mean 2 min, then this should be the same as exponential with mean 120 s. Generalizing, there is nothing special here about 2 and 60, so it should be clear that if we multiply an exponential random variable with mean \(\mu\) by a positive constant \(c\) we get another exponential random variable with mean \(c\mu\). This is also easily verified using a moment generating function argument.

The method illustrated above can be applied to other transformations.

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & Let \(X\) have pdf \(f_{X}(x)\) and let \(Y=g(X)\), where \(g\) is monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) so it has an inverse function \(X=h(Y)\). Assume that \(h\) has a derivative \(h^{\prime}(y)\). Then \(f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}(h(y))\ \|h^{\prime}(y)\|\) \\ \end{tabular}

ProofHere is the proof assuming that \(g\) is monotonically increasing. The proof for \(g\) monotonically decreasing is similar. We follow the last method in Example 4.38. First find the cdf.

\[F_{Y}(y)=P(Y\leq y)=P[g(X)\leq y]=P[X\leq h(y)]=F_{X}[h(y)].\]

Now differentiate the cdf, letting \(x=h(y)\).

\[f_{Y}(y)=\frac{d}{dy}F_{Y}(y)=\frac{d}{dy}F_{X}[h(y)]=\frac{dx}{dy}\frac{d}{ dx}F_{X}(x)=h^{\prime}(y)f_{X}(x)=h^{\prime}(y)f_{X}[h(y)]\]

The absolute value is needed on the derivative only in the other case where \(g\) is decreasing. The set of possible values for \(Y\) is obtained by applying \(g\) to the set of possible values for \(X\).

A heuristic view of the theorem (and a good way to remember it) is to say that

\[f_{X}(x)dx=f_{Y}(y)dy\]

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}(x)\frac{dx}{dy}=f_{X}(h(y))h^{\prime}(y)\]

Of course, because the pdf's must be nonnegative, the absolute value is required on the derivative if it is negative.

Sometimes it is easier to find the derivative of \(g\) than to find the derivative of \(h\). In this case, remember that

\[\frac{dx}{dy}=\frac{1}{dy}\]

Let's apply the theorem to the situation introduced in Example 4.38. There \(Y=g(X)=60X\) and \(X=h(Y)=Y/60\).

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}[h(y)]|h^{\prime}(y)|=\frac{1}{2}e^{-x/2}\frac{1}{60}=\frac{1}{1 20}e^{-y/120}\hskip 28.452756pty>0\]

Here is an even simpler example. Suppose the arrival time of a delivery truck will be somewhere between noon and 2:00. We model this with a random variable \(X\) that is uniform on [0, 2], so \(f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\) on that interval. Let \(Y\) be the time in minutes, starting at noon, \(Y=g(X)=60X\) so \(X=h(Y)=Y/60\).

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}[h(y)]|h^{\prime}(y)|=\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{60}=\frac{1}{120} \hskip 14.226378pt0<y<120\]

Is this intuitively reasonable? Beginning with a uniform distribution on [0, 2], we multiply it by 60, and this spreads it out over the interval [0, 120]. Notice that the pdf is divided by 60, not multiplied by 60. Because the distribution is spread over a wider interval, the density curve must be lower if the total area under the curve is to be 1.

This being a special day (an A in statistics!), you plan to buy a steak (substitute five Portobello mushrooms if you are a vegetarian) for dinner. The weight \(X\) of the steak is normally distributed with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). The steak costs \(a\) dollars per pound, and your other purchases total \(b\) dollars. Let \(Y\) be the total bill at the cash register, so \(Y=aX+b\). What is the distribution of the new variable \(Y\)? Let \(X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})\) and \(Y=aX+b\), where \(a\neq 0\). In our example \(a\) is positive, but we will do a more general calculation that allows negative \(a\). Then the inverse function is \(x=h(y)=(y-b)/a\).

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}[h(y)]|h^{\prime}(y)|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-(\{[(y-b)/a ]-\mu\}/\sigma)^{2}}\frac{1}{|a|}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}|a|\sigma}e^{-[(y-b-a\mu )/(a|\sigma|)]^{2}}\]Thus, \(Y\) is normally distributed with mean \(a\mu+b\) and standard deviation \(|a|\sigma\). The mean and standard deviation did not require the new theory of this section because we could have just calculated \(E(Y)=E(aX+b)=a\mu+b\), \(V(Y)=V(aX+b)=a^{2}\sigma^{2}\), and therefore \(\sigma_{Y}=|a|\sigma\).

As a special case, take \(Y=(X-\mu)/\sigma\), so \(b=-\mu/\sigma\) and \(a=1/\sigma\). Then \(Y\) is normal with mean value \(a\mu+b=\mu/\sigma-\mu/\sigma=0\) and standard deviation \(|a|\sigma=|1/\sigma|\sigma=1\). Thus the transformation \(Y=(X-\mu)/\sigma\) creates a new normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. That is, \(Y\) is standard normal. This is the first proposition in Section 4.3.

On the other hand, suppose that \(X\) is already standard normal, \(X\sim N(0,\,1)\). If we let \(Y=\mu+\sigma X\), then \(a=\sigma\) and \(b=\mu\), so \(Y\) will have mean \(0\cdot\sigma+\mu=\mu\), and standard deviation \(|a|\cdot 1=\sigma\). If we start with a standard normal, we can obtain any other normal distribution by means of a linear transformation. \(\blacksquare\)

Here we want to see what can be done with the simple uniform distribution. Let \(X\) have uniform distribution on [0, 1], so \(f_{X}(x)=1\) for \(0<x<1\). We want to transform \(X\) so that \(g(X)=Y\) has a specified distribution. Let's specify that \(f_{Y}(y)=y/2\) for \(0<y<2\). Integrating this, we get the cdf \(F_{Y}(y)=y^{2}/4\), \(0<y<2\). The trick is to set this equal to the inverse function \(h(y)\). That is, \(x=h(y)=y^{2}/4\). Inverting this (solving for \(y\), and using the positive root), we get \(y=g(x)=F_{Y}^{-1}(x)=\sqrt{4x}=2\sqrt{x}\). Let's apply the foregoing theorem to see if \(Y=g(X)=2\sqrt{X}\) has the desired pdf:

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}[h(y)]|h^{\prime}(y)|=(1)\,\frac{2y}{4}\,=\,\frac{y}{2}\qquad 0<y<2\]

A graphical representation may help in understanding why the transform \(Y=2\sqrt{X}\) yields \(f_{Y}(y)=y/2\) if \(X\) is uniform on [0, 1]. Figure 4.37(a) shows the uniform distribution with [0, 1] partitioned into ten subintervals. In Figure 4.37(b) the endpoints of these intervals are shown after transforming according to \(y=2\sqrt{x}\). The heights of the rectangles are arranged so each rectangle still has area.1, and therefore the probability in each interval is preserved. Notice the close fit of the dashed line, which has the equation \(f_{Y}(y)=y/2\).

Figure 4.37: The effect on the pdf if \(X\) is uniform on [0, 1] and \(Y=2\sqrt{X}\)

Can the method be generalized to produce a random variable with any desired pdf? Let the pdf \(f_{Y}(y)\) be specified along with the corresponding cdf \(F_{Y}(y)\). Define \(g\) to be the inverse function of \(F_{Y}\), so \(h(y)=F_{Y}(y)\). If \(X\) is uniformly distributed on [0, 1], then using the theorem, the pdf of \(Y=g(X)=F_{Y}^{-1}(X)\) is

\[f_{X}[h(y)]\,|h^{\prime}(y)|=(1)f_{Y}(y)=f_{Y}(y)\]

This says that you can build any random variable you want from humble uniform variates. Uniformly distributed random variables are available from almost any calculator or computer language, so our method enables you to produce values of any continuous random variable, as long as you know its cdf.

To get a sequence of random values with the pdf \(f_{Y}(y)=y/2\), \(0<y<2\), start with a sequence of random values from the uniform distribution on [0, 1]:.529,.043,.294, \(\ldots\). Then take \(Y=g(X)=F_{Y}^{-1}(X)=2\sqrt{X}\) to get 1.455,.415, 1.084, \(\ldots\). \(\blacksquare\)

Can the process be reversed, so we start with any continuous random variable and transform to a uniform variable? Let \(X\) have pdf\(f_{X}(x)\) and cdf \(F_{X}(x)\). Transform \(X\) to \(Y=g(X)=F_{X}(X)\), so \(g\) is \(F_{X}\). The inverse function of \(g=F_{X}\) is \(h\). Again apply the theorem to show that \(Y\) is uniform:

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}[h(y)]|h^{\prime}(y)|=f_{X}(x)/f_{X}(x)=1\qquad 0\leq x\leq 1\]

This works because \(h\) and \(F\) are inverse functions, so their derivatives are reciprocals.

To illustrate the transformation to uniformity, assume that \(X\) has pdf \(f_{X}(x)=x/2\), \(0<x<2\). Integrating this, we get the cdf \(F_{X}(x)=x^{2}/4\), \(0<x<2\). Let \(Y=g(X)=F_{X}(X)=X^{2}/4\). Then the inverse function is \(h(y)=\sqrt{4y}=2\sqrt{y}\) and

\[f_{Y}(y)=f_{X}(x)\left|\frac{dx}{dy}\right|=\frac{f_{X}(x)}{\left|\frac{dy}{dx} \right|}=\frac{x/2}{x/2}=1\qquad 0<y<1\]

The foregoing theorem requires a monotonic transformation, but there are important applications in which the transformation is not monotonic. Nevertheless, it may be possible to use the theorem anyway with a little trickery.

In this example, we start with a standard normal random variable \(X\), and we transform to \(Y=X^{2}\). Of course, this is not monotonic over the interval for \(X\), (\(-\infty\), \(\infty\)). However, consider the transformation \(U=|X|\). Can we obtain the pdf of this intuitively, without recourse to any theory? Because \(X\) has a symmetric distribution, the pdf of \(U\) is \(f_{U}(u)=f_{X}(u)+f_{X}(-u)=2\,f_{X}(u)\). Don't despair if this is not intuitively clear, because we'll verify it shortly. For the time being, assume it to be true. Then \(Y=X^{2}=|X|^{2}=U^{2}\), and the transformation in terms of \(U\) is monotonic because its set of possible values is [0, \(\infty\)). Thus we can use the theorem with \(h(y)=y^{.5}\):

\[f_{Y}(y) =f_{U}[h(y)]\,h^{\prime}(y)=2f_{X}[h(y)]\,h^{\prime}(y)\] \[=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\,e^{-5(y^{.5})^{2}}(.5y^{-.5})=\frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi y}}e^{-y/2}\quad y{>}0\]

This is the chi-squared distribution (with 1 degree of freedom) introduced in Section 4.4. The squares of normal random variables are important because the sample variance is built from squares, and we will need the distribution of the variance. The variance for normal data is proportional to a chi-squared rv.

You were asked to believe intuitively that \(f_{U}(u)=2\)\(f_{X}(u)\) on an intuitive basis. Here is a little derivation that works as long as \(f_{X}(x)\) is an even function, [i.e. \(f_{X}(-x)=f_{X}(x)\)]. If \(u>0\),

\[\begin{array}{l}F_{U}(u)=P(U\leq u)=P(|X|\leq u)=P(-u\leq X\leq u)=2P(0\leq X \leq u)\\ \hskip 14.226378pt=2[F_{X}(u)-F_{X}(0)].\end{array}\]

Differentiating this with respect to \(u\) gives \(f_{U}(u)=2\)\(f_{X}(u)\). 

Sometimes the theorem cannot be used at all, and you need to use the cdf. Let \(f_{X}(x)=(x+1)/8\), \(-1<x<3\), and \(Y=X^{2}\). The transformation is not monotonic and \(f_{X}(x)\) is not an even function. Possible values of \(Y\) are \(\{y\): \(0\leq y\leq 9\}\). Considering first \(0\leq y\leq 1\),

\[\begin{array}{l}F_{Y}(y)=P(Y\leq y)=P(X^{2}\leq y)=P(-\sqrt{y}\leq X\leq\sqrt {y})=\int_{-\sqrt{y}}^{\sqrt{y}}\frac{u+1}{8}du=\frac{\sqrt{y}}{4}\end{array}\]

Then, on the other subinterval, \(1<y\leq 9\),

\[\begin{array}{l}F_{Y}(y)=P(Y\leq y)=P(X^{2}\leq y)=P\bigl{(}-\sqrt{y}\leq X \leq\sqrt{y}\bigr{)}=P\bigl{(}-1\leq X\leq\sqrt{y}\bigr{)}\\ \hskip 14.226378pt=\int_{-1}^{\sqrt{y}}\frac{u+1}{8}du=(1+y+2\sqrt{y})/16\end{array}\]

Differentiating, we get

\[\begin{array}{l}f_{Y}(y)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{8\sqrt{y}}&0<y<1\\ \frac{y+\sqrt{y}}{16y}&1<y<9\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\end{array}\]

If \(X\) is discrete, what happens to the pmf when we do a monotonic transformation?

Let \(X\) have the geometric distribution, with pmf \(p_{X}(x)=(1-p)^{x}\)\(p\), \(x=0\), \(1\), \(2\), \(\ldots\), and define \(Y=X/3\). Then the pmf of \(Y\) is

\[\begin{array}{l}p_{Y}(y)=P(Y=y)=P\biggl{(}\frac{X}{3}=y\biggr{)}=P(X=3y)=p_{ X}(3y)=(1-p)^{3y}p\\ \hskip 14.226378pty=0,1/3,2/3,...\end{array}\]

Notice that there is no need for a derivative in finding the pmf for transformations of discrete random variables.

To put this on a more general basis in the discrete case, if \(Y=g(X)\) with inverse \(X=h(Y)\), then

\[p_{Y}(y)=P(Y=y)=P[g(X)=h(y)]=P[X=h(y)]=p_{X}[h(y)],\]

and the set of possible values of \(Y\) is obtained by applying \(g\) to the set of possible values of \(X\).

The article "Statistical Sampling in Tax Audits" (_Statistics and the Law_, 2008: 320-343) proposes modeling the uncertainty in \(t\) by regarding it as a normally distributed random variable with mean value \(m\) and standard deviation \(s\) (in the article, these two parameters are estimated from the results of a tax audit involving \(n\) sampled transactions). If \(a\) represents the amount the retailer is assessed, then an underassessment results if \(t\) > \(a\) and an overassessment if \(a\) > \(t\). We can express this in terms of a _loss function_, a function that shows zero loss if \(t\) = \(a\) but increases as the gap between \(t\) and \(a\) increases. The proposed loss function is L(_a,t_) = \(t\) - \(a\) if \(t\) > \(a\) and = _k_(_a_ - _t_) if \(t\) < \(a\) (_k_ > 1 is suggested to incorporate the idea that overassessment is more serious than underassessment). **a.**: Show that \(a^{*}=\mu+\sigma\Phi^{-1}(1/(k+1))\) is the value of \(a\) that minimizes the expected loss, where Ph-1 is the inverse function of the standard normal cdf. **b.**: If \(k\) = 2 (suggested in the article), \(m\) = $100,000, and \(s\) = $10,000, what is the optimal value of \(a\), and what is the resulting probability of overassessment?

Derive the pdf of \(Y\). **b.**: If \(X\) has a gamma distribution with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), what is the probability distribution of \(Y=cX\)?
**147.**: Based on data from a dart-throwing experiment, the article "Shooting Darts" (_Chance_, Summer 1997: 16-19) proposed that the horizontal and vertical errors from aiming at a point target should be independent of each other, each with a normal distribution having mean 0 and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). It can then be shown that the pdf of the distance \(V\) from the target to the landing point is

**149.**: Let \(X\) denote the lifetime of a component, with \(f(x)\) and \(F(x)\) the pdf and cdf of \(X\). The probability that the component fails in the interval (\(x\), \(x\) + \(\Delta x\)) is approximately \(f(x)\cdot\Delta x\). The conditional probability that it fails in (\(x\), \(x\) + \(\Delta x\)) given that it has lasted at least \(x\) is \(f(x)\cdot\Delta x/[1-F(x)]\). Dividing this by \(\Delta x\) produces the failure rate function:

\[r(x)=\frac{f(x)}{1-F(x)}\]

An increasing failure rate function indicates that older components are increasingly likely to wear out, whereas a decreasing failure rate is evidence of increasing reliability with age. In practice, a "bathtub-shaped" failure is often assumed. **a.**: If \(X\) is exponentially distributed, what is \(r(x)\)? **b.**: If \(X\) has a Weibull distribution with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), what is \(r(x)\)? For what parameter values will \(r(x)\) be increasing? For what parameter values will \(r(x)\) decrease with \(x\)? **c.**: Since \(r(x)=-(d/dx)\text{ln}[1-F(x)]\), \(\text{ln}[1-F(x)]=-f(x)\;dx\). Suppose

\[r(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\alpha\left(1-\frac{x}{\beta}\right)&0\leq x \leq\beta\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

so that if a component lasts \(\beta\) hours, it will last forever (while seemingly unreasonable, this model can be used to study just "initial wearout"). What are the cdf and pdf of \(X\)?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:244]

## Chapter 1 Introduction

In Chapters 3 and 4, we studied probability models for a single random variable. Many problems in probability and statistics lead to models involving several random variables simultaneously. In this chapter, we first discuss probability models for the joint behavior of several random variables, putting special emphasis on the case in which the variables are independent of each other. We then study expected values of functions of several random variables, including covariance and correlation as measures of the degree of association between two variables.

The third section considers conditional distributions, the distributions of random variables given the values of other random variables. The next section is about transformations of two or more random variables, generalizing the results of Section 4.7. In the last section of this chapter we discuss the distribution of order statistics: the minimum, maximum, median, and other statistics that can be found by arranging the observations in order.

## Chapter 1 Jointly Distributed Random Variables

There are many experimental situations in which more than one random variable (rv) will be of interest to an investigator. We shall first consider joint probability distributions for two discrete rv's, then for two continuous variables, and finally for more than two variables.

### The Joint Probability Mass Function

for Two Discrete Random Variables

The probability mass function (pmf) of a single discrete rv \(X\) specifies how much probability mass is placed on each possible \(X\) value. The joint pmf of two discrete rv's \(X\) and \(Y\) describes how much probability mass is placed on each possible pair of values (\(x\), \(y\)).

\begin{tabular}{l l} DEFINITION & Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two discrete rv's defined on the sample space \(\mathcal{E}\) of an experiment. The **joint probability mass function**\(p(x,y)\) is defined for each pair of numbers (\(x\), \(y\)) by \\  & \(p(x,y)=P(X=x\) and \(Y=y)\) \\  & Let \(A\) be any set consisting of pairs of (\(x\), \(y\)) values. Then the probability that the random pair (\(X\), \(Y\)) lies in \(A\) is obtained by summing the joint pmf over pairs in \(A\): \\  & \(P[(X,Y)\in A]=\sum_{(x,y)\in A}p(x,y)\) \\ \end{tabular}

A large insurance agency services a number of customers who have purchased both a homeowner's policy and an automobile policy from the agency. For each type of policy, a deductible amount must be specified. For an automobile policy, the choices are $100 and $250, whereas for a homeowner's policy, the choices are 0, $100, and $200. Suppose an individual with both types of policy is selected at random from the agency's files. Let \(X=\) the deductible amount on the auto policy and \(Y=\) the deductible amount on the homeowner's policy. Possible (\(X\), \(Y\)) pairs are then (100, 0), (100, 100), (100, 200), (250, 0), (250, 100), and (250, 200); the joint pmf specifies the probability associated with each one of these pairs, with any other pair having probability zero. Suppose the joint pmf is given in the accompanying **joint probability table**: \\  & & \(y\) \\ \(p(x,y)\) & 0 & 100 & 200 \\ \(x\) & 100 &.20 &.10 &.20 \\  & 250 &.05 &.15 &.30 \\ \end{tabular}

Then \(p(100,100)=P(X=100\) and \(Y=100)=P(\$100\) deductible on both policies) \(=.10\). The probability \(P(Y\geq 100)\) is computed by summing probabilities of all \((x,y)\) pairs for which \(y\geq 100\):

\[P(Y\geq 100)=p(100,100)+p(250,100)+p(100,200)+p(250,200)=.75\]

A function \(p(x,y)\) can be used as a joint pmf provided that \(p(x,y)\geq 0\) for all \(x\) and \(y\) and \(\sum_{x}\sum_{y}p(x,y)=1\).

The pmf of one of the variables alone is obtained by summing \(p(x,y)\) over values of the other variable. The result is called a _marginal pmf_ because when the \(p(x,y)\) values appear in a rectangular table, the sums are just marginal (row or column) totals

\begin{tabular}{c c} \multicolumn{2}{l}{**DEFINITION**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{The **marginal probability mass functions** of \(X\) and of \(Y\), denoted by \(p_{X}(x)\) and \(p_{Y}(y)\), respectively, are given by \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{\(p_{X}(x)=\sum_{y}p(x,y)\)} & \(p_{Y}(y)=\sum_{x}p(x,y)\) \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{ } \\ \end{tabular} Thus to obtain the marginal pmf of \(X\) evaluated at, say, \(x=100\), the probabilities \(p(100,y)\) are added over all possible \(y\) values. Doing this for each possible \(X\) value gives the marginal pmf of \(X\) alone (without reference to \(Y\)). From the marginal pmf's, probabilities of events involving only \(X\) or only \(Y\) can be computed.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \multicolumn{2}{l}{**Example 5.2**} \\ (Example 5.1 & \\ continued) & \\ \end{tabular} And

\[p_{X}(250)=p(250,0)+p(250,100)+p(250,200)=.50\]

The marginal pmf of \(X\) is then

\[p_{X}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}.5&x=100,\ 250\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Similarly, the marginal pmf of \(Y\) is obtained from column totals as

\[p_{Y}(y)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}.25&y=0,\ 100\\.50&y=20\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

so \(P(Y\geq 100)=p_{Y}(100)+p_{Y}(200)=.75\) as before.

## The Joint Probability Density Function for Two Continuous Random Variables

The probability that the observed value of a continuous rv \(X\) lies in a one-dimensional set \(A\) (such as an interval) is obtained by integrating the pdf \(f(x)\) over the set \(A\). Similarly, the probability that the pair \((X,Y)\) of continuous rv's falls in a two-dimensional set \(A\) (such as a rectangle) is obtained by integrating a function called the _joint density function_.

**DEFINITION**: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be continuous rv's. Then \(f(x,y)\) is the **joint probability density function** for \(X\) and \(Y\) if for any two-dimensional set \(A\)

\[P[(X,Y)\in A]=\int_{A}\int_{A}f(x,y)dx\ dy\]

In particular, if \(A\) is the two-dimensional rectangle \(\{(x,y):a\leq x\leq b,c\leq y\leq d\},\) then

\[P[(X,Y)\in A]=P(a\leq X\leq b,c\leq Y\leq d)=\int_{a}^{b}\int_{c}^{d}f(x,y)dy\ dx\]

For \(f(x,y)\) to be a candidate for a joint pdf, it must satisfy \(f(x,y)\geq 0\) and \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)dx\,dy=1\). We can think of \(f(x,y)\) as specifying a surface at height \(f(x,y)\) above the point \((x,y)\) in a three-dimensional coordinate system. Then \(P[(X,Y)\in A]\) is the volume underneath this surface and above the region \(A\), analogous to the area under a curve in the one-dimensional case. This is illustrated in Figure 1.

A bank operates both a drive-up facility and a walk-up window. On a randomly selected day, let \(X=\) the proportion of time that the drive-up facility is in use (at least one customer is being served or waiting to be served) and \(Y=\) the proportion of time that the walk-up window is in use. Then the set of possible values for \((X,Y)\)is the rectangle \(D=\{(x,y):0\leq x\leq 1,0\leq y\leq 1\}\). Suppose the joint pdf of (\(X\), \(Y\)) is given by

\[f(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{6}{5}(x+y^{2})&0\leq x\leq 1,\ 0\leq y \leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

To verify that this is a legitimate pdf, note that \(f(x,\,y)\geq 0\) and

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)\,dx\ dy =\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{6}{5}(x+y^{2})dx\ dy\] \[=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{6}{5}x\ dx\ dy+\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0 }^{1}\frac{6}{5}y^{2}dx\ dy\] \[=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{6}{5}x\ dx+\int_{0}^{1}\frac{6}{5}y^{2}\ dy= \frac{6}{10}+\frac{6}{15}=1\]

The probability that neither facility is busy more than one-quarter of the time is

\[P\bigg{(}0\leq X\leq\frac{1}{4},0\leq Y\leq\frac{1}{4}\bigg{)} =\int_{0}^{1/4}\int_{0}^{1/4}\frac{6}{5}(x+y^{2})\ dx\ dy\] \[=\frac{6}{5}\int_{0}^{1/4}\int_{0}^{1/4}x\ dx\ dy+\frac{6}{5} \int_{0}^{1/4}\int_{0}^{1/4}y^{2}\ dx\ dy\] \[=\frac{6}{20}\cdot\frac{x^{2}}{2}\bigg{|}_{x=0}^{x=1/4}+\frac{6}{ 20}\cdot\frac{y^{3}}{3}\bigg{|}_{y=0}^{y=1/4}=\frac{7}{640}\] \[=.0109\]

As with joint pmf's, from the joint pdf of \(X\) and \(Y\), each of the two marginal density functions can be computed.

The marginal pdf of \(X\), which gives the probability distribution of busy time for the drive-up facility without reference to the walk-up window, is

\[f_{X}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)\ dy=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{6}{5}(x+y^{2})\ dy=\frac{6}{5}x+\frac{2}{5}\]for \(0\leq x\leq 1\) and \(0\) otherwise. The marginal pdf of \(Y\) is

\[f_{Y}(y)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{6}{5}y^{2}+\frac{3}{5}&0\leq y\leq 1 \\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Then

\[P\left(\frac{1}{4}\leq Y\leq\frac{3}{4}\right)=\int_{1/4}^{3/4}\left(\frac{6}{ 5}y^{2}+\frac{3}{5}\right)dy=\frac{37}{80}=.4625.\]

In Example 5.3, the region of positive joint density was a rectangle, which made computation of the marginal pdf's relatively easy. Consider now an example in which the region of positive density is a more complicated figure.

A nut company markets cans of deluxe mixed nuts containing almonds, cashews, and peanuts. Suppose the net weight of each can is exactly 1 lb, but the weight contribution of each type of nut is random. Because the three weights sum to 1, a joint probability model for any two gives all necessary information about the weight of the third type. Let \(X=\) the weight of almonds in a selected can and \(Y=\) the weight of cashews. Then the region of positive density is \(D=\{(x,y):0\leq x\leq 1,0\leq y\leq 1,\)\(x+y\leq 1\}\), the shaded region pictured in Figure 5.2.

Now let the joint pdf for (\(X,\,Y\)) be

\[f(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}24xy&0\leq x\leq 1,\;\;0\leq y\leq 1,\;\;x+y \leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

For any fixed \(x,\,f(x,\,y)\) increases with \(y\); for fixed \(y,\,f(x,\,y)\) increases with \(x\). This is appropriate because the word _deluxe_ implies that most of the can should consist of almonds and cashews rather than peanuts, so that the density function should be large near the upper boundary and small near the origin. The surface determined by \(f(x,\,y)\) slopes upward from zero as (\(x,\,y\)) moves away from either axis.

Clearly,\(f(x,\,y)\geq 0\). To verify the second condition on a joint pdf, recall that a double integral is computed as an iterated integral by holding one variable fixed (such as \(x\) as in Figure 5.2), integrating over values of the other variable lying along

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11511]

In Chapter 2 we pointed out that one way of defining independence of two events is to say that \(A\) and \(B\) are independent if \(P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)\). Here is an analogous definition for the independence of two rv's.

\begin{tabular}{p{28.5pt} p{28.5pt}} \hline \hline DEFINITION & Two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be **independent** if for every pair of \(x\) and \(y\) values, \\  & \(p(x,y)=p_{X}(x)\cdot p_{Y}(y)\)  when \(X\) and \(Y\) are discrete \\ or & (5.1) \\  & \(f(x,y)=f_{X}(x)\cdot f_{Y}(y)\) when \(X\) and \(Y\) are continuous \\ \end{tabular} If (5.1) is not satisfied for all (\(x\), \(y\)), then \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be **dependent**.

The definition says that two variables are independent if their joint pmf or pdf is the product of the two marginal pmf's or pdf's.

In the insurance situation of Examples 5.1 and 5.2,

\[p(100,100)=.10\neq(.5)(.25)=p_{X}(100)\cdot p_{Y}(100)\]

so \(X\) and \(Y\) are not independent. Independence of \(X\) and \(Y\) requires that _every_ entry in the joint probability table be the product of the corresponding row and column marginal probabilities. \(\blacksquare\)

Because \(f(x,y)\) in the nut scenario has the form of a product, \(X\) and \(Y\) would appear to be independent. However, although \(f_{X}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)=f_{Y}\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)=\frac{9}{16}\), \(f\left(\frac{3}{4},\frac{3}{4}\right)=0\neq\frac{9}{16}\cdot\frac{9}{16}\) so the variables are not in fact independent. To be independent, \(f(x,y)\) must have the form \(g(x)\cdot h(y)\)_and_ the region of positive density must be a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. \(\blacksquare\)

Independence of two random variables is most useful when the description of the experiment under study tells us that \(X\) and \(Y\) have no effect on each other. Then once the marginal pmf's or pdf's have been specified, the joint pmf or pdf is simply the product of the two marginal functions. It follows that

\[P(a\leq X\leq b,c\leq Y\leq d)=P(a\leq X\leq b)\cdot P(c\leq Y\leq d)\]

Suppose that the lifetimes of two components are independent of each other and that the first lifetime, \(X_{1}\), has an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda_{1}\) whereas the second, \(X_{2}\), has an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda_{2}\). Then the joint pdf is

\[f(x_{1},x_{2}) =f_{X_{1}}(x_{1})\cdot f_{X_{2}}(x_{2})\] \[=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}\lambda_{1}e^{-\lambda_{1}x_{1}}\cdot \lambda_{2}e^{-\lambda_{2}x_{2}}=\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}e^{-\lambda_{1}x_{1}- \lambda_{2}x_{2}}&x_{1}>0,x_{2}>0\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]Let \(\lambda_{1}=1/1000\) and \(\lambda_{2}=1/1200\), so that the expected lifetimes are 1000 h and 1200 h, respectively. The probability that both component lifetimes are at least 1500 h is

\[P(1500\leq X_{1},1500\leq X_{2}) = P(1500\leq X_{1})\cdot P(1500\leq X_{2})\] \[= e^{-\lambda_{1}(1500)}\cdot e^{-\lambda_{2}(1500)}\] \[= (.2231)(.2865)=.0639\]

### More than Two Random Variables

To model the joint behavior of more than two random variables, we extend the concept of a joint distribution of two variables.

\begin{tabular}{p{227.6pt}} \hline \hline If \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) are all discrete random variables, the **joint pmf** of the variables is the function \\ \(p(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})=P(X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},\ldots,X_{n}=x_{n})\) \\ \(\quad\) If the variables are continuous, the **joint pdf** of \(X_{1},X_{2},\ \ldots,X_{n}\) is the function \(f(x_{1},x_{2},\ \ldots,x_{n})\) such that for any \(n\) intervals \([a_{1},b_{1}],\ \ldots,[a_{n},b_{n}],\) \\ \(P(a_{1}\leq X_{1}\leq b_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\leq X_{n}\leq b_{n})=\int_{a_{1}}^{b _{1}}\ldots\int_{a_{n}}^{b_{n}}\!\!\!\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\,dx_{n}\ldots dx_{1}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In a binomial experiment, each trial could result in one of only two possible outcomes. Consider now an experiment consisting of \(n\) independent and identical trials, in which each trial can result in any one of \(r\) possible outcomes. Let \(p_{i}=P(\text{outcome $i$ on any particular trial})\), and define random variables by \(X_{i}=\) the number of trials resulting in outcome \(i\) (\(i=1,\ldots,r\)). Such an experiment is called a **multinomial experiment**, and the joint pmf of \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{r}\) is called the **multinomial distribution**. By using a counting argument analogous to the one used in deriving the binomial distribution, the joint pmf of \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{r}\) can be shown to be

\[p(x_{1},\ldots,x_{r})\] \[= \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{n!}{(x_{1}!)(x_{2}!)\cdot\ldots \cdot(x_{r}!)}p_{1}^{x_{1}}\cdots\cdot p_{r}^{x_{r}},&x_{i}=0,1,2,\ldots,\ \ \text{with}\ x_{1}+\cdots+x_{r}=n\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The case \(r=2\) gives the binomial distribution, with \(X_{1}=\) number of successes and \(X_{2}=n-X_{1}=\) number of failures.

In the case \(r=3\), the leading part of the expression for the joint pmf comes from the number of ways of choosing \(x_{1}\) of the \(n\) trials to be outcomes of the first type and then \(x_{2}\) of the remaining \(n-x_{1}\) trials to be outcomes of the second type: \(\quad\begin{pmatrix}n\\ x_{1}\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}n-x_{1}\\ x_{2}\end{pmatrix}=\frac{n!}{x_{1}!(n-x_{1})!}\cdot\frac{(n-x_{1})!}{x_{2}!(n- x_{1}-x_{2})!}=\frac{n!}{x_{1}!x_{2}!(n-x_{1}-x_{2})!}\) \\ =\frac{n!}{x_{1}!x_{2}!x_{3}!}.\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

If the allele of each of ten independently obtained pea sections is determined and \(p_{1}\) = \(P(\text{AA})\), \(p_{2}\) = \(P(\text{Aa})\), \(p_{3}\) = \(P(\text{aa})\), \(X_{1}\) = number of AA's, \(X_{2}\) = number of Aa's, and \(X_{3}\) = number of aa's, then

\[p(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) = \frac{10!}{(x_{1}!)(x_{2}!)(x_{3}!)}p_{1}^{x_{1}}p_{2}^{x_{2}}p_{3 }^{x_{3}},\;\;\;x_{i} = 0,1,2,\ldots\text{ and }x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 10\]

If \(p_{1}=p_{3}=.25\), \(p_{2}=.5\), then

\[P(X_{1} = 2,X_{2} = 5,X_{3} = 3) = p(2,5,3) = \frac{10!}{2!5!3!}\left(.25^{2}\right)\left(.50^{5}\right)\left(.25^{3} \right) =.0769\]

When a certain method is used to collect a fixed volume of rock samples in a region, there are four resulting rock types. Let \(X_{1},X_{2}\), and \(X_{3}\) denote the proportion by volume of rock types 1, 2, and 3 in a randomly selected sample (the proportion of rock type 4 is \(1-X_{1}-X_{2}-X_{3}\), so a variable \(X_{4}\) would be redundant). If the joint pdf of \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\) is

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}kx_{1}x_{2}(1-x_{3})&0 \leq x_{1}\leq 1,\,0\leq x_{2}\leq 1,\,0\leq x_{3}\leq 1,\\ &x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

then \(k\) is determined by

\[1 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{ \infty}f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})\,dx_{3}\,dx_{2}\,dx_{1}\] \[= \int_{0}^{1}\left\{\int_{0}^{1-x_{1}}\left[\int_{0}^{1-x_{1}-x_{ 2}}kx_{1}x_{2}(1-x_{3})\,dx_{3}\right]dx_{2}\right\}dx_{1}\]

This iterated integral has value \(k/144\), so \(k=144\). The probability that rocks of types 1 and 2 together account for at most 50% of the sample is

\[P(X_{1}+X_{2} \leq.5) = \iint\limits_{\tiny{\begin{array}{c}0\leq x_{3}\leq 1\text{ for }i=1,2,3\\ \left\{\begin{array}{c}x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}\leq 1,\,x_{4}+x_{5}\leq 1,\,x_{4}+x_{5}\leq 5\end{array}\right\}\\ \end{array}}}\] \[= \int_{0}^{5}\left\{\int_{0}^{5-x_{1}}\left[\int_{0}^{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}14 4x_{1}x_{2}(1-x_{3})\,dx_{3}\right]dx_{2}\right\}dx_{1}\] \[=.6066\]

The notion of independence of more than two random variables is similar to the notion of independence of more than two events.

The random variables \(X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}\) are said to be **independent** if for _every_ subset \(X_{i_{1}},X_{i_{2}},\ldots,X_{i_{k}}\) of the variables (each pair, each triple, and so on), the joint pmf or pdf of the subset is equal to the product of the marginal pmf's or pdf's.

Thus if the variables are independent with \(n=4\), then the joint pmf or pdf of any two variables is the product of the two marginals, and similarly for any three variables and all four variables together. Most important, once we are told that \(n\) variables are independent, then the joint pmf or pdf is the product of the \(n\) marginals.

If \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) represent the lifetimes of \(n\) components, the components operate independently of each other, and each lifetime is exponentially distributed with parameter \(\lambda\), then

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}) = \left(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{1}}\right)\cdot\left(\lambda e^{- \lambda x_{2}}\right)\cdot\cdots\cdot\left(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{n}}\right)\] \[= \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda x_{1}}&x_{1}\geq 0,x_{2}\geq 0,\ldots,x_{n}\geq 0\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

If these \(n\) components are connected in series, so that the system will fail as soon as a single component fails, then the probability that the system lasts past time \(t\) is

\[P(X_{1}>t,\ldots,X_{n}>t) = \int_{t}^{\infty}\ldots\int_{t}^{\infty}f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\, dx_{1}\ldots dx_{n}\] \[= \left(\int_{t}^{\infty}\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{1}}dx_{1}\right) \cdots\left(\int_{t}^{\infty}\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{n}}dx_{n}\right)\] \[= \left(e^{-\lambda t}\right)^{n}=e^{-n\lambda t}\]

Therefore,

\[P(\text{system lifetime}\leq t)=1-e^{-n\lambda t}\;\;\;\text{for}\;\;t\geq 0\]

which shows that _system_ lifetime has an exponential distribution with parameter \(n\lambda\); the expected value of system lifetime is 1/\(n\lambda\). 

In many experimental situations to be considered in this book, independence is a reasonable assumption, so that specifying the joint distribution reduces to deciding on appropriate marginal distributions.

### 5.2 Expected Values, Covariance, and Correlation

We previously saw that any function _h_(_X_) of a single rv \(X\) is itself a random variable. However, to compute _E_[_h_(_X_)], it was not necessary to obtain the probability distribution of _h_(_X_); instead, _E_[_h_(_X_)] was computed as a weighted average of _h_(_X_) values, where the weight function was the pmf _p_(_x_) or pdf _f_(_x_) of \(X\). A similar result holds for a function _h_(_X_, _Y_) of two jointly distributed random variables.

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be jointly distributed rv's with pmf _p_(_x_, _y_) or pdf _f_(_x_, _y_) according to whether the variables are discrete or continuous. Then the expected value of a function _h_(_X_, _Y_), denoted by _E_[_h_(_X_, _Y_)] or _m_\({}_{h}\)(_X_,_Y_) is given by

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:259]

The method of computing the expected value of a function \(h(X_{1},...,X_{n})\) of \(n\) random variables is similar to that for two random variables. If the \(X_{i}\)'s are discrete, \(E[h(X_{1},...,X_{n})]\) is an \(n\)-dimensional sum; if the \(X_{i}\)'s are continuous, it is an \(n\)-dimensional integral.

When \(h(X,Y)\) is a product of a function of \(X\) and a function of \(Y\), the expected value simplifies in the case of independence. In particular, let \(X\) and \(Y\) be continuous independent random variables and suppose \(h(X,Y)=XY\). Then

\[E(XY) =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xpf(x,y)\,dx\ dy= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xpf_{X}(x)\,f_{Y}(y)\,dx\,dy\] \[=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf_{Y}(y)[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf_{X}(x) \,dx\,]\,dy=E(X)E(Y)\]

The discrete case is similar. More generally, essentially the same derivation works for several functions of random variables.

[Proof] Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be independent random variables and assume that the expected values of \(h_{1}(X_{1}),h_{2}(X_{2}),\,\ldots,h_{n}(X_{n})\) all exist. Then

\[E[h_{1}(X_{1})\cdot h_{2}(X_{2})\cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot h_{n}(X_{n})]=E[h_{1}(X_{1})]\cdot E[h_{2}(X_{2})]\cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot E[h_{n}(X_{n})]\]

### Covariance

When two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are not independent, it is frequently of interest to assess how strongly they are related to each other.

[Proof] The **covariance** between two rv's \(X\) and \(Y\) is

\[\text{Cov}(X,Y) =E[(X-\mu_{X})(Y-\mu_{Y})]\] \[=\left\{\begin{aligned} &\sum_{x}\sum_{y}(x-\mu_{X})(y-\mu_{Y})p(x,y)&&\text{if}\ X\text{and}\ Y\text{are discrete}\\ &\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu_{X})(y-\mu_{Y})f(x,y)\,dx\ dy&&\text{if}\ X\text{and}\ Y\text{are continuous}\end{aligned}\right.\]

The rationale for the definition is as follows. Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) have a strong positive relationship to each other, by which we mean that large values of \(X\) tend to occur with large values of \(Y\) and small values of \(X\) with small values of \(Y\). Then most of the probability mass or density will be associated with (\(x-\mu_{X}\)) and (\(y-\mu_{Y}\)) either both positive (both \(X\) and \(Y\) above their respective means) or both negative, so the product (\(x-\mu_{X}\)) (\(y-\mu_{Y}\)) will tend to be positive. Thus for a strong positive relationship, Cov(\(X\), \(Y\)) should be quite positive. For a strong negative relationship, the signs of (\(x-\mu_{X}\)) and (\(y-\mu_{Y}\)) will tend to be opposite, yielding a 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:261]

The joint and marginal pdf's of \(X=\) amount of almonds and \(Y=\) amount of cashews were

\[f(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}24xy&0\leq x\leq 1,\ \ 0\leq y\leq 1,\ \ x+y\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

\[f_{X}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}12x(1-x)^{2}&0\leq x\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

with \(f_{Y}(y)\) obtained by replacing \(x\) by \(y\) in \(f_{X}(x)\). It is easily verified that \(\mu_{X}=\mu_{Y}=\frac{2}{5}\), and

\[E(XY) =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xyf(x,y)\,dx\,dy= \int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1-x}xy\cdot 24xy\,dy\,dx\] \[=8\int_{0}^{1}x^{2}(1-x)^{3}dx=\frac{2}{15}\]

Thus \(\text{Cov}(X,Y)=\frac{2}{15}-\binom{2}{5}\binom{2}{5}=\frac{2}{15}-\frac{4}{2 5}=-\frac{2}{75}\). A negative covariance is reasonable here because more almonds in the can implies fewer cashews.

The covariance satisfies a useful linearity property (Exercise 33).

If \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are rv's and \(a\) and \(b\) are constants then

\[\text{Cov}(aX+bY,Z)=a\ \text{Cov}(X,Z)+b\ \text{Cov}(Y,Z)\]

It would appear that the relationship in the insurance example is quite strong since \(\text{Cov}(X,Y)=1875\), whereas in the nut example \(\text{Cov}(X,Y)=-\frac{2}{75}\) would seem to imply quite a weak relationship. Unfortunately, the covariance has a serious defect that makes it impossible to interpret a computed value of the covariance. In the insurance example, suppose we had expressed the deductible amount in cents rather than in dollars. Then \(100X\) would replace \(X\), \(100Y\) would replace \(Y\), and the resulting covariance would be \(\text{Cov}(100X,\,100Y)=(100)(100)\text{Cov}(X,\,Y)=18,750,000\). If, on the other hand, the deductible amount had been expressed in hundreds of dollars, the computed covariance would have been \((.01)(.01)(1875)=.1875\). _The defect of covariance is that its computed value depends critically on the units of measurement_. Ideally, the choice of units should have no effect on a measure of strength of relationship. This is achieved by scaling the covariance.

## Correlation

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(\;\) & The **correlation coefficient** of \(X\) and \(Y\), denoted by \(\text{Corr}(X,\,Y)\), or \(\rho_{X,Y}\), or just \(\rho\), is defined by \\ \(\rho_{X,Y}=\frac{\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\sigma_{X}\cdot\sigma_{Y}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

It is easily verified that in the insurance problem of Example 5.14, \(E(X^{2})=36,250,\sigma^{2}x=36,250-(175)^{2}=5625,\sigma_{X}=75,E(Y^{2})=22,500, \sigma_{Y}^{2}=6875\), and \(\sigma_{Y}=82.92\). This gives

\[\rho=\frac{1875}{(75)(82.92)}=.301\]

The following proposition shows that \(\rho\) remedies the defect of Cov(\(X\), \(Y\)) and also suggests how to recognize the existence of a strong (linear) relationship.

**Proposition 1**.: If \(a\) and \(c\) are either both positive or both negative,

\[\text{Corr}(aX+b,cY+d)=\text{ Corr}(X,Y)\]
**2.**: For any two rv's \(X\) and \(Y,-1\leq\text{Corr}(X,Y)\leq 1\)

Statement 1 says precisely that the correlation coefficient is not affected by a linear change in the units of measurement (if, say, \(X=\) temperature in \({}^{\circ}\)C, then \(9X/5+32=\) temperature in \({}^{\circ}\)F). According to Statement 2, the strongest possible positive relationship is evidenced by \(\rho=\) +1, whereas the strongest possible negative relationship corresponds to \(\rho=-1\). The proof of the first statement is sketched in Exercise 31, and that of the second appears in Exercise 35 and also Supplementary Exercise 76 at the end of the next chapter. For descriptive purposes, the relationship will be described as strong if \(|\rho|\geq.8\), moderate if \(.5<|\rho|<.8\), and weak if \(|\rho|\leq.5\).

If we think of \(p(x\), \(y)\) or \(f(x\), \(y)\) as prescribing a mathematical model for how the two numerical variables \(X\) and \(Y\) are distributed in some population (height and weight, verbal SAT score and quantitative SAT score, etc.), then \(\rho\) is a population characteristic or parameter that measures how strongly \(X\) and \(Y\) are related in the population. In Chapter 12, we will consider taking a sample of pairs \((x_{1}\), \(y_{1}),...,(x_{n}\), \(y_{n})\) from the population. The sample correlation coefficient \(r\) will then be defined and used to make inferences about \(\rho\).

The correlation coefficient \(\rho\) is actually not a completely general measure of the strength of a relationship.

**Proposition 1**.: If \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, then \(\rho=0\), but \(\rho=0\) does not imply independence.
**2.**: \(\rho=1\) or \(-1\) iff \(Y=aX+b\) for some numbers \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a\neq 0\).

Exercise 29 and Example 5.17 relate to Property 1, and Property 2 is investigated in Exercises 32 and 35.

This proposition says that \(\rho\) is a measure of the degree of **linear** relationship between \(X\) and \(Y\), and only when the two variables are perfectly related in a linear manner will \(\rho\) be as positive or negative as it can be. A \(\rho\) less than 1 in absolute value indicates only that the relationship is not completely linear, but there may still be a very strong nonlinear relation. Also, \(\rho=0\) does not imply that \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, but only that there is complete absence of a linear relationship. When \(\rho=0\), \(X\) and \(Y\) are said to be **uncorrelated**. Two variables could be uncorrelated yet highly dependent because of a strong nonlinear relationship, so be careful not to conclude too much from knowing that \(\rho=0\).

Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be discrete rv's with joint pmf

\[p(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{4}&(x,y)=(-4,\ 1),(4,-1),(2,\ 2),(-2,-2)\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The points that receive positive probability mass are identified on the (\(x\), \(y\)) coordinate system in Figure 5.5. It is evident from the figure that the value of \(X\) is completely determined by the value of \(Y\) and vice versa, so the two variables are completely dependent. However, by symmetry \(\mu_{X}=\mu_{Y}=0\) and \(E(XY)=(-4)\frac{1}{4}+(-4)\frac{1}{4}+(4)\frac{1}{4}+(4)\frac{1}{4}=0\) so \(\text{Cov}(X,Y)=E(XY)-\mu_{X}\cdot\mu_{Y}=0\) and thus \(\rho_{X,Y}=0\). Although there is perfect dependence, there is also complete absence of any linear relationship!

A value of \(\rho\) near 1 does not necessarily imply that increasing the value of \(X\)_causes_\(Y\) to increase. It implies only that large \(X\) values are _associated_ with large \(Y\) values. For example, in the population of children, vocabulary size and number of cavities are quite positively correlated, but it is certainly not true that cavities cause vocabulary to grow. Instead, the values of both these variables tend to increase as the value of age, a third variable, increases. For children of a fixed age, there is probably a very low correlation between number of cavities and vocabulary size. In summary, association (a high correlation) is not the same as causation.

3. Show that if \(Y=aX+b\ (a\neq 0)\), then \(\text{Corr}(X,Y)=+1\) or \(-1\). Under what conditions will \(\rho=+1\)?
4. Show that if \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are rv's and \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, then \(\text{Cov}(aX+bY,Z)=a\ \text{Cov}(X,Z)+b\ \text{Cov}(Y,Z)\)
5. Let \(Z_{X}\) be the standardized \(X,Z_{X}=(X-\mu_{X})/\sigma_{X}\), and let \(Z_{Y}\) be the standardized \(Y,Z_{Y}=(Y-\mu_{Y})/\sigma_{Y}\). Use Exercise 31 to show that \(\text{Corr}(X,Y)=\ \text{Cov}(Z_{X},Z_{Y})=E(Z_{X}Z_{Y})\)

## 5 Conditional Distributions

The distribution of \(Y\) can depend strongly on the value of another variable \(X\). For example, if \(X\) is height and \(Y\) is weight, the distribution of weight for men who are 6 ft tall is very different from the distribution of weight for short men. The conditional distribution of \(Y\) given \(X=x\) describes for each possible \(x\) how probability is distributed over the set of possible \(y\) values. We define the conditional distribution of \(Y\) given \(X\), but the conditional distribution of \(X\) given \(Y\) can be obtained by just reversing the roles of \(X\) and \(Y\). Both definitions are analogous to that of the conditional probability P(\(A|B\)) as the ratio \(\text{P}(A\cap B)/\text{P}(B)\).

\begin{tabular}{l l} \multicolumn{2}{l}{**DEFINITION**} & \multicolumn{1}{l}{Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two discrete random variables with joint pmf \(p(x,y)\) and marginal \(X\) pmf \(p_{X}(x)\). Then for any \(x\) value such that \(p_{X}(x)>0\), the **conditional probability mass function of \(Y\) given \(X=x\)** is \\  & \(p_{Y|X}(y|x)=\dfrac{p(x,y)}{p_{X}(x)}\) \\ \end{tabular} An analogous formula holds in the continuous case. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two continuous random variables with joint pdf \(f(x,y)\) and marginal \(X\) pdf \(f_{X}(x)\). Then for any \(x\) value such that \(f_{X}(x)>0\), the **conditional probability density function of \(Y\) given \(X=x\)** is \\  & \(f_{Y|X}(y|x)=\dfrac{f(x,y)}{f_{X}(x)}\) \\ \end{tabular}

For a discrete example, reconsider Example 5.1, where \(X\) represents the deductible amount on an automobile policy and \(Y\) represents the deductible amount on a homeowner's policy. Here is the joint distribution again.

\begin{tabular}{l c|c c c}  & & & \(y\) & \\ \(p(x,y)\) & & 0 & 100 & 200 \\ \(x\) & 100 &.20 &.10 &.20 \\  & 250 &.05 &.15 &.30 \\ \end{tabular}

The distribution of \(Y\) depends on \(X\). In particular, let's find the conditional probability that \(Y\) is 200, given that \(X\) is 250, using the definition of conditional probability from Section2.4.

\[P(Y=200|X=250)=\frac{P(Y=200\text{ and }X=250)}{P(X=250)}=\frac{.3}{.05+.15+.3}=.6\]

With our new definition we obtain the same result

\[p_{Y|X}(200|250)=\frac{p(250,200)}{p_{X}(250)}=\frac{.3}{.05+.15+.3}=.6\]

The conditional probabilities for the two other possible values of \(Y\) are

\[p_{Y|X}(0|250) =\frac{p(250,0)}{p_{X}(250)}=\frac{.05}{.05+.15+.3}=.1\] \[p_{Y|X}(100|250) =\frac{p(250,100)}{p_{X}(250)}=\frac{.15}{.05+.15+.3}=.3\]

Thus, \(p_{Y|X}(0|250)+p_{Y|X}(100|250)+p_{Y|X}(200|250)=.1+.3+.6=1\). This is no coincidence; conditional probabilities satisfy the properties of ordinary probabilities. They are nonnegative and they sum to 1. Essentially, the denominator in the definition of conditional probability is designed to make the total be 1.

Reversing the roles of \(X\) and \(Y\), we find the conditional probabilities for \(X\), given that \(Y=0\):

\[p_{X|Y}(100|0)= \frac{p(100,0)}{p_{Y}(0)}=\frac{.20}{.20+.05}=.8\] \[p_{X|Y}(250|0)= \frac{p(250,0)}{p_{Y}(0)}=\frac{.05}{.20+.05}=.2\]

Again, the conditional probabilities add to 1. 

For a continuous example, recall Example 5.5, where \(X\) is the weight of almonds and \(Y\) is the weight of cashews in a can of mixed nuts. The sum of \(X+Y\) is at most one pound, the total weight of the can of nuts. The joint pdf of \(X\) and \(Y\) is

\[f(x,y)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}24xy&0\leq x\leq 1,\ 0\leq y\leq 1,\ x+y\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

In Example 5.5 it was shown that

\[f_{X}(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}12x(1-x)^{2}&0\leq x\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The conditional pdf of \(Y\) given that \(X=x\) is

\[f_{Y|X}(y|x)= \frac{f(x,y)}{f_{X}(x)}=\frac{24xy}{12x(1-x)^{2}}=\frac{2y}{(1-x)^ {2}}\quad 0\leq y\leq 1-x\]This can be used to get conditional probabilities for \(Y\). For example,

\[P(Y\leq.25|X=.5)=\int_{-\infty}^{25}f_{Y|X}(y|.5)\,dy=\int_{0}^{25}\frac{2y}{(1-.5 )^{2}}\,dy=\big{[}4y^{2}\big{]}_{0}^{.25}=.25\]

Recall that \(X\) is the weight of almonds and \(Y\) is the weight of cashews, so this says that, given that the weight of almonds is.5 pound, the probability is.25 for the weight of cashews to be less than.25 pound.

Just as in the discrete case, the conditional distribution assigns a total probability of 1 to the set of all possible \(Y\) values. That is, integrating the conditional density over its set of possible values should yield 1:

\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_{Y|X}(y|x)\,dy=\int_{0}^{1-x}\frac{2y}{(1-x)^{2}}\,dy =\bigg{[}\frac{y^{2}}{(1-x)^{2}}\bigg{]}_{0}^{1-x}=1\]

Whenever you calculate a conditional density, we recommend doing this integration as a validity check. 

Because the conditional distribution is a valid probability distribution, it makes sense to define the conditional mean and variance.

**DEFINITION**: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two discrete random variables with conditional probability mass function \(p_{Y|X}(y|x)\). Then the **conditional mean** or **expected value of \(Y\) given that \(X=x\)** is

\[\mu_{Y|X=x}=E(Y|X=x)=\sum_{y\in D_{Y}}y\,p_{Y|X}(y|x)\]

An analogous formula holds in the continuous case. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be two continuous random variables with conditional probability density function \(f_{Y|X}(y|x)\). Then

\[\mu_{Y|X=x}=E(Y|X=x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf_{Y|X}(y|x)\,dy\]

The conditional mean of any function \(g(Y)\) can be obtained similarly. In the discrete case,

\[E(g(Y)|X=x)=\sum_{y\in D_{Y}}g(y)\,p_{Y|X}(y|x)\]

In the continuous case

\[E(g(Y)|X=x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(y)f_{Y|X}(y|x)\,dy\]

The **conditional variance of \(Y\) given \(X=x\)** is

\[\sigma^{2}_{Y|X=x}=V(Y|X=x)=E\Big{\{}[Y-E(Y|X=x)]^{2}|X=x\Big{\}}\]There is a shortcut formula for the conditional variance analogous to that for \(V(Y)\) itself:

\[\sigma^{2}_{Y|X=x}=V(Y|X=x)=E(Y^{2}|X=x)-\mu^{2}_{Y|X=x}\]

Having found the conditional distribution of \(Y\) given \(X=250\) in Example 5.18, we compute the conditional mean and variance.

\[\mu_{Y|X=250} =E(Y|X=250)=0p_{Y|X}(0|250)+100p_{Y|X}(100|250)\] \[\quad+200p_{Y|X}(200|250)=0(.1)+100(.3)+200(.6)=150.\]

Given that the possibilities for \(Y\) are 0, 100, and 200 and most of the probability is on 100 and 200, it is reasonable that the conditional mean should be between 100 and 200.

Let's use the alternative formula for the conditional variance.

\[E\big{(}Y^{2}|X=250\big{)} =0^{2}p_{Y|X}(0|250)+100^{2}p_{Y|X}(100|250)+200^{2}p_{Y|X}(200|2 50)\] \[=0^{2}(.1)+100^{2}(.3)+200^{2}(.6)=27,000.\]

Thus,

\[\sigma^{2}_{Y|X=250}=V(Y|X=250)=E\big{(}Y^{2}|X=250\big{)}-\mu^{2}_{Y|X=250}=2 7,000-150^{2}=4500.\]

Taking the square root, we get \(\sigma_{Y|X=250}=67.08\), which is in the right ballpark when we recall that the possible values of \(Y\) are 0, 100, and 200.

It is important to realize that \(E(Y|X=x)\) is one particular possible value of a random variable \(E(Y|X)\), which is a function of \(X\). Similarly, the conditional variance \(V(Y|X=x)\) is a value of the rv \(V(Y|X)\). The value of \(X\) might be 100 or 250. So far, we have just \(E(Y|X=250)=150\) and \(V(Y|X=250)=4500\). If the calculations are repeated for \(X=100\), the results are \(E(Y|X=100)=100\) and \(V(Y|X=100)=8000\). Here is a summary in the form of a table:

\[\begin{array}{lcccc}\hline x&P(X=x)&E(Y|X=x)&V(Y|X=x)\\ \hline 100&.5&100&8000\\ 250&.5&150&4500\\ \hline\end{array}\]

Similarly, the conditional mean and variance of \(X\) can be computed for specific \(Y\). Taking the conditional probabilities from Example 5.18,

\[\mu_{X|Y=0} =E(X|Y=0)=100p_{X|Y}(100|0)+250p_{X|Y}(250|0)\] \[=100(.8)+250(.2)=130\] \[\sigma^{2}_{X|Y=0} =V(X|Y=0)=E\Big{(}[X-E(X|Y=0)]^{2}|Y=0\Big{)}\] \[=(100-130)^{2}p_{X|Y}(100|0)+(250-130)^{2}p_{X|Y}(250|0)\] \[=30^{2}(.8)+120^{2}(.2)=3600.\]Again, the conditional mean and variance are random because they depend on the random value of \(Y\). 

For any given weight of almonds, let's find the expected weight of cashews. Using the definition of conditional mean,

\[\mu_{Y|X=x} =E(Y|X=x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}yf_{Y|X}(y|x)\,dy=\int_{0}^{1-x}y \,\frac{2y}{(1-x)^{2}}\,dy\] \[=\frac{2}{3}(1-x)\qquad 0\leq\,x\,\leq 1\]

The conditional mean is a linear decreasing function of \(x\). When there are more almonds, we expect less cashews. This is in accord with Figure 5.2, which shows that for large \(X\) the domain of \(Y\) is restricted to small values. To get the corresponding variance, compute first

\[E(Y^{2}|X=x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}y^{2}f_{Y|X}(y|x)\,dy=\int_{0}^{1-x}y^{2} \frac{2y}{(1-x)^{2}}\,dy=\frac{(1-x)^{2}}{2}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,0\leq x\leq 1\]

Then the conditional variance is

\[\sigma_{Y|X=x}^{2}=V(Y|X=x)=E\big{(}Y^{2}|X=x\big{)}-\mu_{Y|X=x}^{2}=\frac{(1- x)^{2}}{2}-\frac{4(1-x)^{2}}{9}=\frac{(1-x)^{2}}{18}\]

and the conditional standard deviation is

\[\sigma_{Y|X=x}=\frac{1-x}{\sqrt{18}}\]

This says that the variance gets smaller as the weight of almonds approaches 1. Does this make sense? When the weight of almonds is 1, the weight of cashews is guaranteed to be 0, implying that the variance is 0. This is clarified by Figure 5.2, which shows that the set of \(y\)-values narrows to 0 as \(x\) approaches 1. 

## Independence

Recall that in Section 5.1 two random variables were defined to be independent if their joint pmf or pdf factors into the product of the marginal pmf's or pdf's. We can understand this definition better with the help of conditional distributions. For example, suppose there is independence in the discrete case. Then

\[p_{Y|X}(y|x)=\frac{p(x,y)}{p_{X}(x)}=\frac{p_{X}(x)p_{Y}(y)}{p_{X}(x)}=p_{Y}(y)\]That is, independence implies that the conditional distribution of \(Y\) is the same as the unconditional distribution. The implication works in the other direction, too. If

\[p_{Y|X}(y|x)=p_{Y}(y)\]

then

\[\frac{p(x,y)}{p_{X}(x)}=p_{Y}(y)\]

so

\[p(x,y)=p_{X}(x)p_{Y}(y)\]

and therefore \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent. Is this intuitively reasonable? Yes, because independence means that knowing \(X\) does not change our probabilities for \(Y\).

In Example 5.7 we said that independence necessitates the region of positive density being a rectangle (possibly infinite in extent). In terms of conditional distribution this region tells us the domain of \(Y\) for each \(X\). For independence we need to have the domain of \(Y\) not be dependent on \(X\). That is, the conditional distributions must all be the same, so the interval of positive density must be the same for each \(x\), implying a rectangular region.

### The Bivariate Normal Distribution

Perhaps the most useful example of a joint distribution is the bivariate normal. Although the formula may seem rather messy, it is based on a simple quadratic expression in the standardized variables (subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation). The bivariate normal density is

\[f(x,y)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}}e^{-\{[(x-\mu_{1})/ \sigma_{1}]^{2}-2\rho(x-\mu_{1})(y-\mu_{2})/\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}+[(y-\mu_{2})/ \sigma_{2}]^{2}\}/[2(1-\rho^{2})]}\]

There are five parameters, including the mean \(\mu_{1}\) and the standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}\) of \(X\) and the mean \(\mu_{2}\) and the standard deviation \(\sigma_{2}\) of \(Y\). The fifth parameter \(\rho\) is the correlation between \(X\) and \(Y\). The integration required to do bivariate normal probability calculations is quite difficult. Computer code is available for calculating \(P(X<x,Y<y)\) approximately using numerical integration, and some statistical software packages (e.g., R, SAS, Stata) include this feature.

What does the density look like when plotted as a function of \(x\) and \(y\)? If we set \(f(x,y)\) to a constant to investigate the contours, this is setting the exponent to a constant, and it will give ellipses centered at (\(x\), \(y\)) = (\(\mu_{1}\), \(\mu_{2}\)). That is, all of the contours are concentric ellipses. The plot in three dimensions looks like a mountain with elliptical cross-sections. The vertical cross-sections are all proportional to normal densities. See Figure 5.6.

If \(\rho=0\), then \(f(x,y)=f_{X}(x)\,f_{Y}(y)\), where \(X\) is normal with mean \(\mu_{1}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}\), and \(Y\) is normal with mean \(\mu_{2}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{2}\). That is, \(X\) and \(Y\) have independent normal distributions. In this case the plot in three dimensions has elliptical contours that reduce to circles. Recall that in Section 5.2 we emphasized that independence of \(X\) and \(Y\) implies \(\rho=0\) but, in general, \(\rho=0\) does not imply independence. However, we have just seen that when \(X\) and \(Y\) are bivariate normal \(\rho=0\) does imply independence. Therefore, in the bivariate normal case \(\rho=0\) if and only if the two rv's are independent.

What do we get for the marginal distributions? As you might guess, the marginal distribution \(f_{X}(x)\) is just a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_{1}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}\):

\[f_{X}(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\{[(x-\mu_{1})/\sigma_{1}]^{2}\}/2}\]

The integration to show this [integrating \(f(x,y)\) on \(y\) from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\)] is rather messy. More generally, any linear combination of the form \(aX+bY\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants, is normally distributed.

We get the conditional density by dividing the marginal density of \(X\) into \(f(x,y)\). Unfortunately, the algebra is again a mess, but the result is fairly simple. The conditional density \(f_{YX}(y|x)\) is a normal density with mean and variance given by

\[\mu_{Y|X=x}=E(Y|X=x)=\mu_{2}+\rho\sigma_{2}\ \frac{x-\mu_{1}}{\sigma_{1}}\]

\[\sigma_{Y|X=x}^{2}=V(Y|X=x)=\sigma_{2}^{2}(1-\rho^{2})\]

Notice that the conditional mean is a linear function of \(x\) and the conditional variance doesn't depend on \(x\) at all. When \(\rho=0\), the conditional mean is the mean of \(Y\) and the conditional variance is just the variance of \(Y\). In other words, if \(\rho=0\), then the conditional distribution of \(Y\) is the same as the unconditional distribution of \(Y\). This says that if \(\rho=0\) then \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent, but we already saw that previously in terms of the factorization of \(f(x,y)\) into the product of the marginal densities.

When \(\rho\) is close to \(1\) or \(-1\) the conditional variance will be much smaller than \(V(Y)\), which says that knowledge of \(X\) will be very helpful in predicting \(Y\)

Figure 5.6: A graph of the bivariate normal pdf

If \(\rho\) is near 0 then \(X\) and \(Y\) are nearly independent and knowledge of \(X\) is not very useful in predicting \(Y\).

Let \(X\) be mother's height and \(Y\) be daughter's height. A similar situation was one of the first applications of the bivariate normal distribution, by Francis Galton in 1886, and the data was found to fit the distribution very well. Suppose a bivariate normal distribution with mean \(\mu_{1}=64\) in. and standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}=3\) in. for \(X\) and mean \(\mu_{2}=65\) in. and standard deviation \(\sigma_{2}=3\) in. for \(Y\). Here \(\mu_{2}>\mu_{1}\), which is in accord with the increase in height from one generation to the next. Assume \(\rho=.4\). Then

\[\mu_{Y|X=x} =\mu_{2}+\rho\sigma_{2}\frac{x-\mu_{1}}{\sigma_{1}}=65+.4(3)\frac {x-64}{3}=65+.4(x-64)=.4x+39.4\] \[\sigma_{Y|X=x}^{2} =V(Y|X=x)=\sigma_{2}^{2}(1-\rho^{2})=9\;(1-.4^{2})=7.56\text{ and }\sigma_{Y|X=x}=2.75\]

Notice that the conditional variance is 16% less than the variance of \(Y\). Squaring the correlation gives the percentage by which the conditional variance is reduced relative to the variance of \(Y\). 

## Regression to the Mean

The formula for the conditional mean can be re-expressed as

\[\frac{\mu_{Y|X=x}-\mu_{2}}{\sigma_{2}}=\rho\cdot\frac{x-\mu_{1}}{\sigma_{1}}\]

In words, when the formula is expressed in terms of standardized variables, the standardized conditional mean is just \(\rho\) times the standardized \(x\). In particular, for the example of heights,

\[\frac{\mu_{Y|X=x}-65}{3}=.4\cdot\frac{x-64}{3}\]

If the mother is 5 in. above the mean of 64 in. for mothers, then the daughter's conditional expected height is just 2 in. above the mean for daughters. In this example, with equal standard deviations for \(Y\) and \(X\), the daughter's conditional expected height is always closer to its mean than the mother's height is to its mean. In general, the conditional expected \(Y\) is closer when it is measured in terms of standard deviations. One can think of the conditional expectation as being pulled back toward the mean, and that is why Galton called this _regression to the mean_.

Regression to the mean occurs in many contexts. For example, let \(X\) be a baseball player's average for the first half of the season and let \(Y\) be the average for the second half. Most of the players with a high \(X\) (above.300) will not have such a high \(Y\). The same kind of reasoning applies to the "sophomore jinx," which says that if a player has a very good first season, then the player is unlikely to do as well in the second season.

The Mean and Variance Via the Conditional Mean and Variance

From the conditional mean we can obtain the mean of \(Y\). From the conditional mean and the conditional variance, the variance of \(Y\) can be obtained. The following theorem uses the idea that the conditional mean and variance are themselves random variables, as illustrated in the tables of Example 5.20.

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{THEOREM}&\mbox{{a.} }E(Y)=E[E(Y|X)]\\ \mbox{{b.} }V(Y)=V[E(Y|X)]+E[V(Y|X)]\end{array}\]

The result in (a) says that \(E(Y)\) is a weighted average of the conditional means \(E(Y|X=x)\), where the weights are given by the pmf or pdf of \(X\). We give the proof of just part (a) in the discrete case:

\[\begin{array}{ll}E[E(Y|X)]&=\sum_{x\in D_{X}}E(Y|X=x)p_{X}(x)= \sum_{x\in D_{X}}\sum_{y\in D_{Y}}yp_{Y|X}(y|x)p_{X}(x)\\ &=\sum_{x\in D_{X}}\sum_{y\in D_{Y}}y\frac{p(x,y)}{p_{X}(x)}p_{X}(x)= \sum_{y\in D_{Y}}y\sum_{x\in D_{X}}p(x,y)=\sum_{y\in D_{Y}}yp_{Y}(y)=&E(Y)\end{array}\]

To try to get a feel for the theorem, let's apply it to Example 5.20. Here again is the table for the conditional mean and variance of \(Y\) given \(X\).

\[\begin{array}{ll}\hline x&\mbox{{\boldmath$P$}}(\mbox{{\boldmath$X$}}=\mbox{{ \boldmath$x$}})&\mbox{{\boldmath$E$}}(\mbox{{\boldmath$Y$}}|\mbox{{\boldmath$X$}}= \mbox{{\boldmath$x$}})&\mbox{{\boldmath$V$}}(\mbox{{\boldmath$Y$}}|\mbox{{ \boldmath$X$}}=\mbox{{\boldmath$x$}})\\ \hline 100&.5&100&8000\\ 250&.5&150&4500\\ \hline\end{array}\]

Compute

\[\begin{array}{ll}E[E(Y|X)]&=&E(Y|X=100)P(X=100)+E(Y|\;X=250)P(X=250)\\ &=&100(.5)+150(.5)=125\\ \end{array}\]

Compare this with \(E(Y)\) computed directly:

\[\begin{array}{ll}E(Y)&=&0P(Y=0)+100P(Y=100)+200P(Y=200)\\ &=&0(.25)+100(.25)+200(.5)=125\\ \end{array}\]

For the variance first compute the mean of the conditional variance:

\[\begin{array}{ll}E[V(Y|X)]&=&V(Y|X=100)P(X=100)+V(Y|X=250)P(X=250)\\ &=&4500(.5)+8000(.5)=6250\\ \end{array}\]

Then comes the variance of the conditional mean. We have already computed the mean of this random variable to be 125. The variance is

\[V[E(Y|X)]=.5(100-125)^{2}+.5(150-125)^{2}=625\]Finally, do the sum in part (b) of the theorem:

\[V(Y)=V[E(Y|X)]+E[V(Y|X)]=625+6250=6875\]

To compare this with \(V(Y)\) calculated from the pmf of \(Y\), compute first

\[E\big{(}Y^{2}\big{)} = 0^{2}P(Y=0)+100^{2}P(Y=100)+200^{2}P(Y=200)\] \[= 0(.25)+10,000(.25)+40,000(.5)=22,500\]

Thus, \(V(Y)=E(Y^{2})-[E(Y)]^{2}=22,500-125^{2}=6875\), in agreement with the calculation based on the theorem.

Here is an example where the theorem is helpful in finding the mean and variance of a random variable that is neither discrete nor continuous.

The probability of a claim being filed on an insurance policy is.1, and only one claim can be filed. If a claim is filed, the amount is exponentially distributed with mean $1000. Recall from Section 4.4 that the mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution are the same, so the variance is the square of this value. We want to find the mean and variance of the amount paid. Let \(X\) be the number of claims (0 or 1) and let \(Y\) be the payment. We know that \(E(Y|X=0)=0\) and \(E(Y|X=1)=1000\). Also, \(V(Y|X=0)=0\) and \(V(Y|X=1)=1000^{2}=1,000,000\). Here is a table for the distribution of \(E(Y|X=x)\) and \(V(Y|X=x)\):

\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline \(x\) & \(P(X=x)\) & \(E(Y|X=x)\) & \(V(Y|X=x)\) \\ \hline
0 &.9 & 0 & 0 \\
1 &.1 & 1000 & 1,000,000 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Therefore,

\[\begin{array}{l}E(Y)=E[E(Y|X)]=E(Y|X=0)P(X=0)+E(Y|X=1)P(X=1)\\ =0(.9)+1000(.1)=100\end{array}\]

The variance of the conditional mean is

\[V[E(Y|X)]=.9(0-100)^{2}+.1(1000-100)^{2}=90,000\]

The expected value of the conditional variance is

\[E[V(Y|X)]=.9(0)+.1(1,000,000)=100,000\]

Finally, use part (b) of the theorem to get \(V(Y)\):

\[V(Y)=V[E(Y|X)]+E[V(Y|X)]=90,000+100,000=190,000\]

Taking the square root gives the standard deviation, \(\sigma_{Y}=\$435.89\).

Suppose that we want to compute the mean and variance of \(Y\) directly. Notice that \(X\) is discrete, but the conditional distribution of \(Y\) given \(X=1\) is continuous. The random variable \(Y\) itself is neither discrete nor continuous, because it has probability.9 of being 0, but the other.1 of its probability is spread out from 0 to \(\infty\). Such "mixed" distributions may require a little extra effort to evaluate means and variances, although it is not especially hard in this case. Compute

## 54 Transformations of Random Variables

In the previous chapter we discussed the problem of starting with a single random variable \(X\), forming some function of \(X\), such as \(X^{2}\) or \(e^{X}\), to obtain a new random variable \(Y=h(X)\), and investigating the distribution of this new random variable. We now generalize this scenario by starting with more than a single random variable. Consider as an example a system having a component that can be replaced just once before the system itself expires. Let \(X_{1}\) denote the lifetime of the original component and \(X_{2}\) the lifetime of the replacement component. Then any of the following functions of \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) may be of interest to an investigator:

1. The total lifetime \(X_{1}+X_{2}\)
2. The ratio of lifetimes \(X_{1}/X_{2}\); for example, if the value of this ratio is 2, the original component lasted twice as long as its replacement
3. The ratio \(X_{1}/(X_{1}+X_{2})\), which represents the proportion of system lifetime during which the original component operated

### The Joint Distribution of Two New Random Variables

Given two random variables \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\), consider forming two new random variables \(Y_{1}=u_{1}(X_{1},\,X_{2})\) and \(Y_{2}=u_{2}(X_{1},\,X_{2})\). We now focus on finding the joint distribution of these two new variables. Since most applications assume that the \(X_{i}\)'s are continuous we restrict ourselves to that case. Some notation is needed before a general result can be given. Let

\(f(x_{1},\,x_{2})=\) the joint pdf of the two original variables

\(g(y_{1},\,y_{2})=\) the joint pdf of the two new variables

The \(u_{1}(\cdot)\) and \(u_{2}(\cdot)\) functions express the new variables in terms of the original ones. The general result presumes that these functions can be inverted to solve for the original variables in terms of the new ones:

\(X_{1}=v_{1}(Y_{1},\,Y_{2})\,\,,\,X_{2}=v_{2}(Y_{1},\,Y_{2})\)

For example, if

\(y_{1}=x_{1}+x_{2}\) and \(y_{2}=\dfrac{x_{1}}{x_{1}+x_{2}}\)

then multiplying \(y_{2}\) by \(y_{1}\) gives an expression for x\({}_{1}\), and then we can substitute this into the expression for y\({}_{1}\) and solve for \(x_{2}\):

\(x_{1}=y_{1}y_{2}=v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2})\)\(x_{2}=y_{1}(1-y_{2})=v_{2}(y_{1},y_{2})\)

In a final burst of notation, let

\(S=\{(x_{1},x_{2}):f(x_{1},x_{2})>0\}\)\(T=\{(y_{1},y_{2}):g(y_{1},y_{2})>0\}\)

That is, \(S\) is the region of positive density for the original variables and \(T\) is the region of positive density for the new variables; \(T\) is the "image" of \(S\) under the transformation.

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & Suppose that the partial derivative of each \(v_{i}(y_{1},\,y_{2})\) with respect to both \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) exists for every (\(y_{1},\,y_{2}\)) pair in \(T\) and is continuous. Form the 2 \(\times\) 2 matrix \\ \(M=\begin{pmatrix}\dfrac{\partial v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2})}{\partial y_{1}}&\dfrac{ \partial v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2})}{\partial y_{2}}\\ \dfrac{\partial v_{2}(y_{1},y_{2})}{\partial y_{1}}&\dfrac{\partial v_{2}(y_{1 },y_{2})}{\partial y_{2}}\end{pmatrix}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The determinant of this matrix, called the _Jacobian_, is

\[\det(M)=\frac{\partial v_{1}}{\partial y_{1}}\cdot\frac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial y _{2}}-\frac{\partial v_{1}}{\partial y_{2}}\cdot\frac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial y _{1}}\]

The joint pdf for the new variables then results from taking the joint pdf \(f(x_{1},x_{2})\) for the original variables, replacing \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) by their expressions in terms of \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\), and finally multiplying this by the absolute value of the Jacobian:

\[g(y_{1},y_{2})=f[v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2}),v_{2}(y_{1},y_{2})]\cdot|\det(M)|\qquad(y_ {1},y_{2})\in T\]

The theorem can be rewritten slightly by using the notation

\[\det(M)=\left|\frac{\partial(x_{1},x_{2})}{\partial(y_{1},y_{2})}\right|\]

Then we have

\[g(y_{1},y_{2})=f(x_{1},x_{2})\cdot\ \left|\frac{\partial(x_{1},x_{2})}{ \partial(y_{1},y_{2})}\right|\]

which is the natural extension of the univariate result (transforming a single rv \(X\) to obtain a single new rv \(Y\)) \(g(y)=f(x)\cdot\ \mathrm{l}dx/dyl\) discussed in Chapter 4.

Continuing with the component lifetime situation, suppose that \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are independent, each having an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda\). Let's determine the joint pdf of

\[Y_{1}=u_{1}(X_{1},X_{2})=X_{1}+X_{2}\ \mathrm{and}\ Y_{2}=u_{2}(X_{1},X_{2})= \frac{X_{1}}{X_{1}+X_{2}}\]

We have already inverted this transformation:

\[x_{1}=v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2})=y_{1}y_{2}\qquad x_{2}=v_{2}(y_{1},y_{2})=y_{1}(1-y_{ 2})\]

The image of the transformation, i.e. the set of (\(y_{1},y_{2}\)) pairs with positive density, is \(0<y_{1}\) and \(0<y_{2}<1\). The four relevant partial derivatives are

\[\frac{\partial v_{1}}{\partial y_{1}}=y_{2}\quad\frac{\partial v_{1}}{\partial y _{2}}=y_{1}\quad\frac{\partial v_{2}}{\partial y_{1}}=1-y_{2}\quad\frac{ \partial v_{2}}{\partial y_{2}}=-y_{1}\]

from which the Jacobian is \(-y_{1}y_{2}-y_{1}(1-y_{2})=-y_{1}\)

Since the joint pdf of \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) is

\[f(x_{1},x_{2})=\lambda e^{-x_{1}}\cdot\lambda e^{-x_{2}}=\lambda^{2}e^{- \lambda(x_{1}+x_{2})}\qquad x_{1}>0,\ x_{2}>0\]

we have

\[g(y_{1},y_{2})=\lambda^{2}e^{-y_{1}}\cdot y_{1}=\lambda^{2}y_{1}e^{-y_{1}} \cdot 1\qquad 0<y_{1},\ \ 0<y_{2}<1\]

The joint pdf thus factors into two parts. The first part is a gamma pdf with parameters \(\alpha=2\) and \(\beta=1/\lambda\), and the second part is a uniform pdf on (0, 1).

Since the pdf factors and the region of positive density is rectangular, we have demonstrated that

1. The distribution of system lifetime \(X_{1}+X_{2}\) is gamma(\(\alpha=2\), \(\beta=1/\lambda\))
2. The distribution of the proportion of system lifetime during which the original component functions is uniform on (0, 1)
3. \(Y_{1}=X_{1}+X_{2}\) and \(Y_{2}=X_{1}/(X_{1}+X_{2})\) are independent of each other

In the foregoing example, because the joint pdf factored into one pdf involving \(y_{1}\) alone and another pdf involving \(y_{2}\) alone, the individual (i.e. marginal) pdf's of the two new variables were obtained from the joint pdf without any further effort. Often this will not be the case - that is, \(Y_{1}\) and \(Y_{2}\) will not be independent. Then to obtain the marginal pdf of \(Y_{1}\), the joint pdf must be integrated over all values of the second variable. In fact, in many applications an investigator wishes to obtain the distribution of a single function \(u_{1}(X_{1},X_{2})\) of the original variables. To accomplish this, a second function \(u_{2}(X_{1},X_{2})\) is selected, the joint pdf is obtained, and then \(y_{2}\) is integrated out. There are of course many ways to select the second function. The choice should be made so that the transformation can be easily inverted _and_ the integration in the last step is straightforward.

Consider a rectangular coordinate system with a horizontal \(x_{1}\) axis and a vertical \(x_{2}\) axis as shown in Figure 5.7(a). First a point \((X_{1},X_{2})\) is randomly selected, where the joint pdf of \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\) is

\[f(x_{1},x_{2})=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}x_{1}+x_{2}&0<x_{1}<1, \quad 0<x_{2}<1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Then a rectangle with vertices (0, 0), \((X_{1},0)\), \((0,X_{2})\), and \((X_{1},X_{2})\) is formed. What is the distribution of \(X_{1}X_{2}\), the area of this rectangle? To answer this question, let

\[Y_{1}=X_{1}X_{2}\qquad Y_{2}=X_{2}\]

so

\[y_{1}=u_{1}(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{1}x_{2}\qquad y_{2}=u_{2}(x_{1},x_{2})=x_{2}\]

Then

\[x_{1}=v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2})=\frac{y_{1}}{y_{2}}\qquad x_{2}=v_{2}(y_{1},y_{2})=y_ {2}\]

Notice that because \(x_{2}\) (\(=y_{2}\)) is between 0 and 1 and \(y_{1}\) is the product of the two \(x_{i}\)'s, it must be the case that \(0<y_{1}<y_{2}\). The region of positive density for the new variables is then

\[T=\{(y_{1},y_{2}):0<y_{1}<y_{2},0<y_{2}<1\}\]

which is the triangular region shown in Figure 5.7(b).

Since \(\partial v_{2}/\partial y_{1}=0\), the product of the two off-diagonal elements in the matrix \(M\) will be 0, so only the two diagonal elements contribute to the Jacobian:

\[M=\left(\begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{y_{2}}&?\\ 0&1\end{array}\right)\qquad|\det(M)|=\frac{1}{y_{2}}\]

The joint pdf of the two new variables is now

\[g(y_{1},y_{2})=f\left(\frac{y_{1}}{y_{2}},y_{2}\right)\cdot|\det(M)|=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}\left(\frac{y_{1}}{y_{2}}+y_{2}\right)\cdot\frac{1}{y_{2}}& 0<y_{1}<y_{2},\,0<y_{2}<1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

To obtain the marginal pdf of \(Y_{1}\) alone, we must now fix \(y_{1}\) at some arbitrary value between 0 and 1, and integrate out \(y_{2}\). Figure 5.7b shows that we must integrate along the vertical line segment passing through \(y_{1}\) whose lower limit is \(y_{1}\) and whose upper limit is 1:

\[g_{1}(y_{1})=\int\limits_{y_{1}}^{1}\left(\frac{y_{1}}{y_{2}}+y_{2}\right)\, \cdot\,\frac{1}{y_{2}}\,dy_{2}=2(1-y_{1})\quad\ 0\ <y_{1}<\ 1\]

This marginal pdf can now be integrated to obtain any desired probability involving the area. For example, integrating from 0 to.5 gives \(P(\text{area}<.5)=.75\). 

## The Joint Distribution of More than Two New Variables

Consider now starting with three random variables \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), and \(X_{3}\), and forming three new variables \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), and \(Y_{3}\). Suppose again that the transformation can be inverted to express the original variables in terms of the new ones:

\[x_{1}=v_{1}(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}),\quad x_{2}=v_{2}(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}),\quad x_{3 }=v_{3}(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3})\]

Then the foregoing theorem can be extended to this new situation. The Jacobian matrix has dimension \(3\times 3\), with the entry in the \(i\)th row and \(j\)th column being \(\partial v_{i}/\partial y_{j}\). The joint pdf of the new variables results from replacing each \(x_{i}\) in the original pdf \(f(\cdot)\) by its expression in terms of the \(y_{j}\)'s and multiplying by the absolute value of the Jacobian.

Figure 5.7: Regions of positive density for Example 5.26

Consider \(n=3\) identical components with independent lifetimes \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\), each having an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda\). If the first component is used until it fails, replaced by the second one which remains in service until it fails, and finally the third component is used until failure, then the total lifetime of these components is \(Y_{3}=X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}\). To find the distribution of total lifetime, let's first define two other new variables: \(Y_{1}=X_{1}\) and \(Y_{2}=X_{1}+X_{2}\) (so that \(Y_{1}<Y_{2}<Y_{3}\)). After finding the joint pdf of all three variables, we integrate out the first two variables to obtain the desired information. Solving for the old variables in terms of the new gives \[x_{1}=y_{1}\quad x_{2}=y_{2}-y_{1}\quad x_{3}=y_{3}-y_{2}\] It is obvious by inspection of these expressions that the three diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix are all 1's and that the elements above the diagonal are all 0's, so the determinant is 1, the product of the diagonal elements. Since \[f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=\lambda^{3}e^{-\lambda(x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3})}\quad x_{1}>0,x_ {2}>0,x_{3}>0\] by substitution, \[g(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3})=\lambda^{3}e^{-\lambda y_{3}}\quad 0<y_{1}<y_{2}<y_{3}\] Integrating this joint pdf first with respect to \(y_{1}\) between 0 and \(y_{2}\) and then with respect to \(y_{2}\) between 0 and \(y_{3}\) (try it!) gives \[g_{3}(y_{3})=\frac{\lambda^{3}}{2}y_{3}^{2}e^{-\lambda y_{3}}\qquad y_{3}>0\] This is a gamma pdf. The result is easily extended to \(n\) components. It can also be obtained (more easily) by using a moment generating function argument.

## 5 Order Statistics

Many statistical procedures involve ordering the sample observations from smallest to largest and then manipulating these ordered values in various ways. For example, the sample median is either the middle value in the ordered list or the average of the two middle values depending on whether the sample size \(n\) is odd or even. The sample range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. And a trimmed mean results from deleting the same number of observations from each end of the ordered list and averaging the remaining values.

Suppose that \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) is a random sample from a continuous distribution with cumulative distribution function _F_(_x_) and density function _f_(_x_). Because of continuity, for any \(i\), \(j\) with \(i\neq j\), \(P(X_{i}=X_{j})=0\). This implies that with probability 1, the \(n\) sample observations will all be different (of course, in practice all measuring instruments have accuracy limitations, so tied values may in fact result).

The sample median is then \(Y_{(n\ +\ 1)/2}\) when \(n\) is odd, the sample range is \(Y_{n}-Y_{1}\), and for \(n=10\) the 20% trimmed mean is \(\sum_{i=3}^{8}Y_{i}/6\). The order statistics are defined as random variables (hence the use of uppercase letters); observed values are denoted by \(y_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(y_{n}\).

### The Distributions of \(Y_{n}\) and \(Y_{1}\)

The key idea in obtaining the distribution of the largest order statistic is that \(Y_{n}\) is at most \(y\) if and only if every one of the \(X_{i}\)'s is at most \(y\). Similarly, the distribution of \(Y_{1}\) is based on the fact that it will be at least \(y\) if and only if all \(X_{i}\)'s are at least \(y\).

Consider 5 identical components connected in parallel, as illustrated in Figure 5.8(a). Let \(X_{i}\) denote the lifetime (hr) of the \(i\)th component (\(i=1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\)). Suppose that the \(X_{i}\)'s are independent and that each has an exponential distribution with \(\lambda=.01\), so the expected lifetime of any particular component is \(1/\lambda=100\) h. Because of the parallel configuration, the system will continue to function as long as at least one component is still working, and will fail as soon as the last component functioning ceases to do so. That is, the system lifetime is just \(Y_{5}\), the largest order statistic in a sample of size 5 from the specified exponential distribution. Now \(Y_{5}\) will be at most \(y\) if and only if every one of the five \(X_{i}\)'s is at most \(y\). With \(G_{5}(y)\) denoting the cumulative distribution function of \(Y_{5}\),

\[G_{5}(y) =P(Y_{5}\ \leq\ y)=P(X_{1}\ \leq\ y,\ X_{2}\leq y,...,X_{5}\leq y)\] \[=P(X_{1}\ \leq y)\cdot P(X_{2}\leq y)\cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot P(X_{5}\leq y)=\left[F(y)\right]^{5}=\left[1-e^{-.01y}\right]^{5}\]

The pdf of \(Y_{5}\) can now be obtained by differentiating the cdf with respect to \(y\).

Suppose instead that the five components are connected in series rather than in parallel (Figure 5.8(b)). In this case the system lifetime will be \(Y_{1}\), the _smallest_ of the five order statistics, since the system will crash as soon as a single one of the individual components fails. Note that system lifetime will exceed \(y\) hr if and only if the lifetime of every component exceeds \(y\) hr. Thus

\[G_{1}(y) =P(Y_{1}\ \leq\ y)=1-P(Y_{1}>y)=1-P(X_{1}>y,\ X_{2}>y,...,X_{5}>y)\] \[=1-P(X_{1}>y)\cdot P(X_{2}>y)\cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot\ \cdot P(X_{5}>y)=1-\left[e^{-.01y}\right]^{5}=1-e^{-.05y}\]

This is the form of an exponential cdf with parameter.05. More generally, if the \(n\) components in a series connection have lifetimes that are independent, each exponentially distributed with the same parameter \(\lambda\), then system lifetime will be exponentially distributed with parameter \(n\lambda\). The expected system lifetime will then be \(1/n\lambda\), much smaller than the expected lifetime of an individual component. \(\blacksquare\)

An argument parallel to that of the previous example for a general sample size \(n\) and an arbitrary pdf \(f(x)\) gives the following general results.

**PROPOSITION**: Let \(Y_{1}\) and \(Y_{n}\) denote the smallest and largest order statistics, respectively, based on a random sample from a continuous distribution with cdf \(F(x)\) and pdf \(f(x)\). Then the cdf and pdf of \(Y_{n}\) are

\[G_{n}(y)=\left[F(y)\right]^{n}\qquad g_{n}(y)=n[F(y)]^{n-1}\cdot f(y)\]

The cdf and pdf of \(Y_{1}\) are

\[G_{1}(y)=1-\left[1-F(y)\right]^{n}\qquad g_{1}(y)=n[1-F(y)]^{n-1}\cdot f(y)\]

Let \(X\) denote the contents of a one-gallon container, and suppose that its pdf is \(f(x)\)\(=2x\) for \(0\leq x\leq 1\) (and \(0\) otherwise) with corresponding cdf \(F(x)=x^{2}\) in the interval of positive density. Consider a random sample of four such containers. Let's determine the expected value of \(Y_{4}-Y_{1}\), the difference between the contents of the most-filled container and the least-filled container; \(Y_{4}-Y_{1}\) is just the sample range. The pdf's of \(Y_{4}\) and \(Y_{1}\) are

\[g_{4}(y) =4(y^{2})^{3}\cdot 2y\qquad\quad 0\leq y\leq 1\] \[g_{1}(y) =4(1-y^{2})^{3}\cdot 2y\quad 0\leq y\leq 1\]

The corresponding density curves appear in Figure 5.9

Figure 5.8: Systems of components for Example 5.28: (a) parallel connection; (b) series connection

\[E(Y_{4}-Y_{1})=E(Y_{4})-E(Y_{1}) = \int_{0}^{1}y\cdot 8y^{7}dy-\int_{0}^{1}y\cdot 8y(1-y^{2})^{3}dy\] \[= \frac{8}{9}-\frac{384}{945}=.889-.406=.483\]

If random samples of four containers were repeatedly selected and the sample range of contents determined for each one, the long run average value of the range would be.483. 

### The Joint Distribution of the \(n\) Order Statistics

We now develop the joint pdf of \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{n}\). Consider first a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\) of fuel efficiency measurements (mpg). The joint pdf of this random sample is

\[f(x_{1},\;x_{2},\;x_{3})= f(x_{1})\cdot f(x_{2})\cdot f(x_{3})\]

The joint pdf of \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), \(Y_{3}\) will be positive only for values of \(y_{1}\), \(y_{2}\), \(y_{3}\) satisfying \(y_{1}<y_{2}<y_{3}\). What is this joint pdf at the values \(y_{1}=28.4\), \(y_{2}=29.0\), \(y_{3}=30.5\)? There are six different ways to obtain these ordered values:

\[\begin{array}{llll}X_{1}=28.4&X_{2}=29.0&X_{3}=30.5\\ X_{1}=28.4&X_{2}=30.5&X_{3}=29.0\\ X_{1}=29.0&X_{2}=28.4&X_{3}=30.5\\ X_{1}=29.0&X_{2}=30.5&X_{3}=28.4\\ X_{1}=30.5&X_{2}=28.4&X_{3}=29.0\\ X_{1}=30.5&X_{2}=29.0&X_{3}=28.4\\ \end{array}\]

These six possibilities come from the 3! ways to order the three numerical observations once their values are fixed. Thus

\[g(28.4,29.0,30.5)= f(28.4)\cdot f(29.0)\cdot f(30.5)+\cdots+f(30.5)\cdot f(29.0) \cdot f(28.4)\] \[= 3!f(28.4)\cdot f(29.0)\cdot f(30.5)\]

Figure 5.9: Density curves for the order statistics (a) \(Y_{1}\) and (b) \(Y_{4}\) in Example 5.29

Analogous reasoning with a sample of size \(n\) yields the following result:

\[\begin{array}{cc}\text{\small{\sf PROPOSITION}}&\text{\small{\sf Let }}g(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n})\text{\small{\sf denote the joint pdf of the order statistics }}Y_{1},Y_{2},\ldots,Y_{n}\\ &\text{\small{\sf resulting from a random sample of }}X_{i}\text{\small{\sf's from a pdf }}f(x).\text{\small{\sf Then}}\\ &g(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n})=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}n!f(y_{1})\cdot f(y_{2 })\cdot\cdots\cdot f(y_{n})&y_{1}<y_{2}<\ \cdots\ <y_{n}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\\ &\\ \end{array}\]

For example, if we have a random sample of component lifetimes and the lifetime distribution is exponential with parameter \(\lambda\), then the joint pdf of the order statistics is

\[g(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n})=n!\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda(y_{1}+\cdots+y_{n})}\qquad 0<y_{1}<y_{2}<\ \cdots\ <y_{n}\]

Suppose \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\), and \(X_{4}\) are independent random variables, each uniformly distributed on the interval from 0 to 1. The joint pdf of the four corresponding order statistics \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), \(Y_{3}\), and \(Y_{4}\) is \(f(y_{1},y_{2},y_{3},y_{4})=4!\!\cdot\!1\) for \(0<y_{1}<y_{2}<y_{3}<y_{4}<1\). The probability that every pair of \(X_{i}\)s is separated by more than.2 is the same as the probability that \(Y_{2}-Y_{1}>.2\), \(Y_{3}-Y_{2}>.2\), and \(Y_{4}-Y_{3}>.2\). This latter probability results from integrating the joint pdf of the \(Y_{i}\)s over the region.6 \(<y_{4}\)\(<\) 1,.4 \(<y_{3}<y_{4}-.2\),.2 \(<y_{2}<y_{3}-.2\), \(0<y_{1}<y_{2}-.2\):

\[P(Y_{2}-Y_{1}>.2,Y_{3}-Y_{2}>.2,Y_{4}-Y_{3}>.2)=\int_{.6}^{1}\int_{.4}^{y_{4}- 2}\int_{.2}^{y_{3}-2}\int_{0}^{y_{2}-.2}4!dy_{1}dy_{2}dy_{3}dy_{4}\]

The inner integration gives \(4!(y_{2}-.2)\), and this must then be integrated between.2 and \(y_{3}-.2\). Making the change of variable \(z_{2}=y_{2}-.2\), the integration of \(z_{2}\) is from 0 to \(y_{3}-.4\). The result of this integration is \(4!\cdot(y_{3}-.4)^{2}/2\). Continuing with the 3rd and 4th integration, each time making an appropriate change of variable so that the lower limit of each integration becomes 0, the result is

\[P(Y_{2}-Y_{1}>.2,Y_{3}-Y_{2}>.2,Y_{4}-Y_{3}>.2)=.4^{4}=.0256\]

A more general multiple integration argument for \(n\) independent uniform (0, \(B\)) rvs shows that the probability that at all values are separated by at least \(d\) is 0 if \(d\geq B/(n-1)\) and

\[P(\text{all values are separated by more than }d)\]

\[=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}[1-(n-1)d/B]^{n}&0\leq d\leq B/(n-1)\\ 0&d>B/(n-1)\end{array}\right.\]

As an application, consider a year that has 365 days, and suppose that the birth time of someone born in that year is uniformly distributed throughout the 365-day period. Then in a group of 10 independently selected people born in that year, the probability that all of their birth times are separated by more than 24 h (\(d=\)1 day) is (1 \(-\) 9/365)\({}^{10}=.779\). Thus the probability that at least two of the 10 birth times are separated by at most 24 h is.221. As the group size \(n\) increases, it becomes more likely that at least two people have birth times that are within 24 h of each other (but not necessarily on the same day). For \(n=16\), this probability is.467, and for \(n=17\) it is.533. So with as few as 17 people in the group, it is more likely than not that at least two of the people were born within 24 h of each other. Coincidences such as this are not as surprising as one might think. The probability that at least two people are born on the same day (assuming equally likely birthdays) is much easier to calculate than what we have shown here; see Exercise 2.98. 

### The Distribution of a Single Order Statistic

We have already obtained the (marginal) distribution of the largest order statistic \(Y_{n}\) and also that of the smallest order statistic \(Y_{1}\). Let's now focus on an intermediate order statistic \(Y_{i}\) where \(1<i<n\). For concreteness, consider a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{6}\) of \(n=6\) component lifetimes, and suppose we wish the distribution of the \(3^{\text{rd}}\) smallest lifetime \(Y_{3}\). Now the joint pdf of all six order statistics is

\[g(y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{6})=6!f(y_{1})\cdot\ \cdots\ \cdot f(y_{6})\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ y_{1}<y_{2}<y_{3}<y_{4}<y_{5}<y_{6}\]

To obtain the pdf of \(Y_{3}\) alone, we must hold \(y_{3}\) fixed in the joint pdf and integrate out all the other \(y_{i}\)'s. One way to do this is to

1. Integrate \(y_{1}\) from \(-\infty\) to \(y_{2}\), and then integrate \(y_{2}\) from \(-\infty\) to \(y_{3}\).
2. Integrate \(y_{6}\) from \(y_{5}\) to \(\infty\), then integrate \(y_{5}\) from \(y_{4}\) to \(\infty\), and finally integrate \(y_{4}\) from \(y_{3}\) to \(\infty\).

That is,

\[g(y_{3}) =\int_{y_{3}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{4}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{5}}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{y_{2}}6!f(y_{1})\cdot f(y_{2})\cdot\cdots\cdot f(y_{6})\,dy_{ 1}dy_{2}dy_{6}dy_{5}dy_{4}\] \[=6!\left[\int_{-\infty}^{y_{3}}\int_{-\infty}^{y_{2}}f(y_{1})f(y_ {2})\,dy_{1}dy_{2}\right]\cdot\left[\int_{y_{3}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{4}}^{\infty }\int_{y_{5}}^{\infty}\!f(y_{4})f(y_{5})f(y_{6})\,dy_{6}dy_{5}dy_{4}\right] \cdot f(y_{3})\]

In these integrations we use the following general results:

\[\int[F(x)]^{k}\!f(x)dx=\frac{1}{k+1}[F(x)]^{k+1}+c \ \ \ \ \ \ \ [\text{let }u=F(x)]\] \[\int[1-F(x)]^{k}\!f(x)dx=-\frac{1}{k+1}[1-F(x)]^{k+1}+c \ \ \ \ \ \ [\text{let }u=1-F(x)]\]

Therefore

\[\int_{-\infty}^{y_{3}}\int_{-\infty}^{y_{2}}f(y_{1})f(y_{2})\ dy_{1}dy_{2}= \int_{-\infty}^{y_{3}}F(y_{2})f(y_{2})\ dy_{2}=\frac{1}{2}[F(y_{3})]^{2}\]and

\[\int_{y_{3}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{4}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{5}}^{\infty}f(y_{6} )f(y_{5})f(y_{4})\ dy_{6}dy_{5}dy_{4} = \int_{y_{3}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{4}}^{\infty}\left[1-F(y_{5})]f(y_{5} )f(y_{4})\ dy_{5}dy_{4}\right.\] \[= -\int_{y_{3}}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2}\left[1-F(y_{4})\right]^{2}\!\!f( y_{4})\ dy_{4}\] \[= \frac{1}{3\cdot 2}\left[1-F(y_{3})\right]^{3}\]

Thus

\[g(y_{3})=\frac{6!}{2!3!}\left[F(y_{3})\right]^{2}\!\!\left[1-F(y_{3})\right]^{ 3}\!\!f(y_{3})\qquad\qquad-\infty<y_{3}<\infty\]

A generalization of the foregoing argument gives the following expression for the pdf of any single order statistic.

The pdf of the \(i\)th smallest order statistic \(Y_{i}\) is

\[g(y_{i})=\frac{n!}{(i-1)!\cdot(n-i)!}\left[F(y_{i})\right]^{i-1}\left[1-F(y_{i })\right]^{n-i}\!\!f(y_{i})\quad-\infty<y_{i}<\infty\]

Suppose that component lifetime is exponentially distributed with parameter \(\lambda\). For a random sample of \(n=5\) components, the expected value of the sample median lifetime is

\[E(Y_{3})=\int_{0}^{\infty}y\cdot\frac{5!}{2!\cdot 2!}\left(1-e^{-\lambda y} \right)^{2}\!\!\left(e^{-\lambda y}\right)^{2}\cdot\lambda e^{-\lambda y}dy\]

Expanding out the integrand and integrating term by term, the expected value is \(.783/\lambda\). The median of the exponential distribution is, from solving \(F(\tilde{\mu})=.5\), \(\tilde{\mu}=.693/\lambda\). Thus if sample after sample of five components is selected, the long run average value of the sample median will be somewhat larger than the value of the lifetime population distribution median. This is because the exponential distribution has a positive skew. 

## The Joint Distribution of Two Order Statistics

We now focus on the joint distribution of two order statistics \(Y_{i}\) and \(Y_{j}\) with \(i<j\). Consider first \(n=6\) and the two order statistics \(Y_{3}\) and \(Y_{5}\). We must then take the joint pdf of all six order statistics, hold \(y_{3}\) and \(y_{5}\) fixed, and integrate out \(y_{1}\), \(y_{2}\), \(y_{4}\), and \(y_{6}\). That is,

\[g(y_{3},y_{5})=\int_{y_{5}}^{\infty}\int_{y_{3}}^{y_{5}}\int_{y_{-\infty}}^{y_ {3}}\int_{y_{1}}^{y_{3}}6!f(y_{1})\cdot\cdots\cdot f(y_{6})\ dy_{2}\ dy_{1}\ dy_{4}\ dy_{6}\]The result of this integration is \[g_{3,5}(y_{3},y_{5})=\frac{6!}{2!1!1!}\left[F(y_{3})\right]^{2} \left[F(y_{5})-F(y_{3})\right]^{1}\left[1-F(y_{5})\right]^{1}f(y_{3})f(y_{5}) -\infty<y_{3}<y_{5}<\infty\] In the general case, the numerator in the leading expression involving factorials becomes \(n!\) and the denominator becomes \((i-1)!(j-i-1)!(n-j)!\). The three exponents on bracketed terms change in a corresponding way.

### An Intuitive Derivation of Order Statistic PDF's

Let \(\Delta\) be a number quite close to 0, and consider the three class intervals \((-\infty,y],(y,y+\Delta]\), and \((y+\Delta,\infty)\). For a single \(X\), the probabilities of these three classes are

\[p_{1}=F(y)\qquad p_{2}=\int_{y}^{+\Delta}f(x)\,dx\approx f(y)\cdot\Delta\qquad p _{3}=1-F(y+\Delta)\]

For a random sample of size \(n\), it is very unlikely that two or more \(X\)'s will fall in the second interval. The probability that the \(i\)th order statistic falls in the second interval is then approximately the probability that \(i-1\) of the \(X\)'s are in the first interval, one is in the second, and the remaining \(n-iX\)'s are in the third class. This is just a multinomial probability: \[P(y<Y_{i}\leq y+\Delta)\approx\frac{n!}{(i-1)!1!(n-i)!}\left[F(y_{i})\right]^{ i-1}\cdot f(y)\cdot\Delta\left[1-F(y+\Delta)\right]^{n-i}\] Dividing both sides by \(\Delta\) and taking the limit as \(\Delta\to 0\) gives exactly the pdf of \(Y_{i}\) obtained earlier via integration. Similar reasoning works with the joint pdf of \(Y_{i}\) and \(Y_{j}\) (\(i<j\)). In this case there are five relevant class intervals: \((-\infty,y_{i}],\ (y_{i},\ y_{i}+\Delta_{1}],\big{(}y_{i}+\Delta_{1},\ y_{j}\big{]}, \big{(}y_{j},\ y_{j}+\Delta_{2}\big{]},\ \text{and}\ (y_{j}+\Delta_{2},\ \infty)\)

5 A friend of ours takes the bus five days per week to her job. The five waiting times until she can board the bus are a random sample from a uniform distribution on the interval from 0 to 10 min. **a.** Determine the pdf and then the expected value of the largest of the five waiting times. **b.** Determine the expected value of the difference between the largest and smallest times. **c.** What is the expected value of the sample median waiting time? **d.** What is the standard deviation of the largest time?
66. Refer back to example 5.29. Because \(n=4\), the sample median is \((Y_{2}+Y_{3})\)/2. What is the expected value of the sample median, and how does it compare to the median of the population distribution?
67. Referring back to Exercise 6.5, suppose you learn that the smallest of the five waiting times is 4 min. What is the conditional density function of the largest waiting time, and what is the expected value of the largest waiting time in light of this information?
68. Let \(X\) represent a measurement error. It is natural to assume that the pdf \(f(x)\) is symmetric about 0, so that the density at a value \(-c\) is the same as the density at \(c\) (an error of a given magnitude is equally likely to be positive or negative). Consider a random sample of \(n\) measurements, where \(n=2k+1\), so that \(Y_{k+1}\) is the sample median. What can be said about \(E(Y_{k+1})\)? If the \(X\) distribution is symmetric about some other value, so that value is the median of the distribution, what does this imply about \(E(Y_{k+1})\)? [_Hints_: For the first question, symmetry implies that \(1-F(x)=P(X>x)=P(X<-x)=F(-x)\). For the second question, consider \(W=X-\tilde{\mu}\); what is the median of the distribution of \(W\)?]
69. A store is expecting \(n\) deliveries between the hours of noon and 1 p.m. Suppose the arrival time of each delivery truck is uniformly distributed on this one-hour interval and that the times are independent of each other. What are the expected values of the ordered arrival times?
70. Suppose the cdf \(F(x)\) is strictly increasing and let \(F^{-1}(u)\) denote the inverse function for \(0<u<1\). Show that the distribution of \(F(Y_{i})\) is the same as the distribution of the \(i\)th smallest order statistic from a uniform distribution on (0,1). [_Hint_: Start with \(P(F(Y_{i})\leq u)\) and apply the inverse function to both sides of the inequality.] [_Note_: This result should not be surprising to you, since we have already noted that \(F(X)\) has a uniform distribution on (0, 1). The result also holds when the cdf is not strictly increasing, but then extra care is necessary in defining the inverse function.]
71. Let \(X\) be the amount of time an ATM is in use during a particular one-hour period, and suppose that \(X\) has the cdf \(F(x)=x^{\theta}\) for \(0<x<1\) (where \(\theta>1\)). Give expressions involving the gamma function for both the mean and variance of the \(i\)th smallest amount of time \(Y_{i}\) from a random sample of \(n\) such time periods.
72. The logistic pdf \(f(x)=e^{-x}/(1+e^{-x})^{2}\) for \(-\infty<x<\infty\) is sometimes used to describe the distribution of measurement errors. 1. Graph the pdf. Does the appearance of the graph surprise you? 2. For a random sample of size \(n\), obtain an expression involving the gamma function for the moment generating function of the \(i\)th smallest order statistic \(Y_{i}\). This expression can then be differentiated to obtain moments of the order statistics. [_Hint_: Set up the appropriate integral, and then let \(u=1/(1+e^{-x})\).]
73. An insurance policy issued to a boat owner has a deductible amount of $1000, so the amount of damage claimed must exceed this deductible before there will be a payout. Suppose the amount (1000s of dollars) of a randomly selected claim is a continuous rv with pdf \(f(x)=3/x^{4}\) for \(x>1\). Consider a random sample of three claims. 1. What is the probability that at least one of the claim amounts exceeds $5000? 2. What is the expected value of the largest amount claimed?
74. Conjecture the form of the joint pdf of three order statistics \(Y_{i}\), \(Y_{j}\), \(Y_{k}\) in a random sample of size \(n\).
75. Use the intuitive argument sketched in this section to obtain a general formula for the joint pdf of two order statistics
76. Consider a sample of size \(n=3\) from the standard normal distribution, and obtain the expected value of the largest order statistic. What does this say about the expected value of the largest order statistic in a sample of this size from _any_ normal distribution? [_Hint_: With \(\phi(x)\) denoting the standard normal pdf, use the fact that \((d/dx)\phi(x)=-x\phi(x)\) along with integration by parts.]
77. Let \(Y_{1}\) and \(Y_{n}\) be the smallest and largest order statistics, respectively, from a random sample of size \(n\), and let \(W_{2}=Y_{n}-Y_{1}\) (this is the sample range). 1. Let \(W_{1}=Y_{1}\), obtain the joint pdf of the \(W_{i}\)'s (use the method of Section 5.4), and then derive an expression involving an integral for the pdf of the sample range. 2. For the case in which the random sample is from a uniform (0, 1) distribution, carry out the integration of (a) to obtain an explicit formula for the pdf of the sample range.

[_Hint_: First obtain the cumulative distribution function of the total cost, which involves integrating the joint pdf.]

* Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be random variables denoting \(n\) independent bids for an item that is for sale. Suppose each \(X_{i}\) is uniformly distributed on the interval [100, 200]. If the seller sells to the highest bidder, how much can he expect to earn on the sale? [_Hint_: Let \(Y=\max(X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n})\). Find \(F_{Y}(y)\) by using the results of Section 5.5 or else by noting that \(Y\leq y\) iff each \(X_{i}\) is \(\leq y\). Then obtain the pdf and \(E(Y)\).]

* Simulation studies are important in investigating various characteristics of a system or process. They are generally employed when the mathematical analysis necessary to answer important questions is too complicated to yield closed-form solutions. For example, in a system where the time between successive customer arrivals has a particular pdf and the service time of any particular customer has another pdf, simulation can provide information about the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives, the expected number of customers in the system, and the expected waiting time in queue. Such studies depend on being able to generate observations from a specified probability distribution. The _rejection method_ gives a way of generating an observation from a pdf (\(\cdot\)) when we have a way of generating an observation from \(g(\cdot)\) and the ratio \(f(x)/g(x)\) is bounded, that is, \(\leq c\) for some finite \(c\). The steps are as follows: 1. Use a software package's random number generator to obtain a value \(u\) from a uniform distribution on the interval from 0 to 1. 2. Generate a value \(y\) from the distribution with pdf \(g(y)\). 3. If \(u\leq f(y)/cg(y)\), set \(x=y\) ("accept" \(x\)); otherwise return to step 1. That is, the procedure is repeated until at some stage \(u\leq f(y)/cg(y)\). 1. Argue that \(c\geq 1\). [_Hint_: If \(c<1\), then \(f(y)<g(y)\) for all \(y\); why is this bad?] 2. Show that this procedure does result in an observation from the pdf \(f(\cdot)\); that is, \(P(\text{accepted value}\leq x)=F(x)\). [_Hint_: This probability is \(P(\{U\leq f(y)/cg(y)\}\cap\{Y\leq x\})\); to calculate, first integrate with respect to \(u\) for fixed \(y\) and then integrate with respect to \(y\).] 3. Show that the probability of "accepting" at any particular stage is 1/\(c\). What does this imply about the expected number of stages necessary to obtain an acceptable value? What kind of value of \(c\) is desirable? 4. Let \(f(x)=20x(1-x)^{3}\) for \(0<x<1\), a particular beta distribution. Show that taking \(g(y)\) to be a uniform pdf on (0, 1) works. What is the best value of \(c\) in this situation?
5. You are driving on a highway at speed \(X_{1}\). Cars entering this highway after you travel at speeds \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\),.... Suppose these \(X_{i}\)'s are independent and identically distributed with pdf \(f(x)\) and cdf \(F(x)\). Unfortunately there is no way for a faster car to pass a slower one - it will catch up to the slower one and then travel at the same speed. For example, if \(X_{1}=52.3\), \(X_{2}=37.5\), and \(X_{3}=42.8\), then no car will catch up to yours, but the third car will catch up to the second. Let \(N=\) the number of cars that ultimately travel at your speed (in your "cohort"), including your own car. Possible values of \(N\) are 1, 2, 3,.... Show that the pmf of \(N\) is \(p(n)=1/[n(n+1)]\), and then determine the expected number of cars in your cohort. [_Hint_: \(N=3\) requires that \(X_{1}<X_{2}\), \(X_{1}<X_{3}\), \(X_{4}<X_{1}\).]
6. Suppose the number of children born to an individual has pmf \(p(x)\). A _Galton-Watson branching process_ unfolds as follows: At time \(t=0\), the population consists of a single individual. Just prior to time \(t=1\), this individual gives birth to \(X_{1}\) individuals according to the pmf \(p(x)\), so there are \(X_{1}\) individuals in the first generation. Just prior to time \(t=2\), each of these \(X_{1}\) individuals gives birth independently of the others according to the pmf \(p(x)\), resulting in \(X_{2}\) individuals in the second generation (e.g., if \(X_{1}=3\), then \(X_{2}=Y_{1}+Y_{2}+Y_{3}\), where \(Y_{i}\) is the number of progeny of the \(i\)th individual in the first generation). This process then continues to yield a third generation of size \(X_{3}\), and so on. 1. If \(X_{1}=3\), \(Y_{1}=4\), \(Y_{2}=0\), \(Y_{3}=1\), draw a tree diagram with two generations of branches to represent this situation. 2. Let \(A\) be the event that the process ultimately becomes extinct (one way for \(A\) to occur would be to have \(X_{1}=3\) with none of these three second-generation individuals having any progeny) and let \(p*=P(A)\). Argue that \(p*\) satisfies the equation \[p*=\sum\left(p*\right)^{x}\cdot p(x)\] That is, \(p*=h(p*)\) where \(h(s)\) is the probability generating function introduced in Exercise 138 from Chapter 3. _Hint_: \(A=\cup_{x}\) (\(A\cap\{X_{1}=x\}\)), so the law of total probability can be applied. Now given that \(X_{1}=3,A\) will occur if and only if each of the three separate branching processes starting from the first generation ultimately becomes extinct; what is the probability of this happening? 3. Verify that one solution to the equation in (b) is \(p*=1\). It can be shown that this equation has just one other solution, and that the probability of ultimate extinction is in fact the _smaller_ of the two roots. If \(p(0)=.3,p(1)=.5\), and \(p(2)=.2\), what is \(p*\)? Is this consistent with the value of \(\mu\), the expected number of progeny from a single individual? What happens if \(p(0)=.2\), \(p(1)=.5\), and \(p(2)=.3\)?
7. Let \(f(x)\) and \(g(y)\) be pdf's with corresponding cdf's \(F(x)\) and \(G(y)\), respectively. With \(c\) denoting a numerical constant satisfying \(|c|\leq 1\), consider \[f(x,y)=f(x)g(y)\{1+c[2F(x)-1][2G(y)-1]\}\]Show that _f_(_x_, _y_) satisfies the conditions necessary to specify a joint pdf for two continuous rv's. What is the marginal pdf of the first variable _X_? Of the second variable _Y_? For what values of \(c\) are \(X\) and \(Y\) independent? If _f_(_x_) and _g_(_y_) are normal pdf's, is the joint distribution of \(X\) and \(Y\) bivariate normal?
89. The **joint cumulative distribution function** of two random variables \(X\) and \(Y\), denoted by _F_(_x_, _y_), is defined by \[F(x,y) = P[(X \leq x)\cap(Y \leq y)] - \infty < x < \infty, - \infty < y < \infty\] * Suppose that \(X\) and \(Y\) are both continuous variables. Once the joint cdf is available, explain how it can be used to determine the probability \(P[(X,\,Y) \in A]\), where \(A\) is the rectangular region \(\{(x,\,y):\,a \leq x \leq b,\,c \leq y\leq d\}\) * Suppose the only possible values of \(X\) and \(Y\) are 0, 1, 2,... and consider the values \(a\) = 5, \(b = 10\), \(c = 2\), and \(d\) = 6 for the rectangle specified in (a). Describe how you would use the joint cdf to calculate the probability that the pair (_X_, _Y_) falls in the rectangle. More generally, how can the rectangular probability be calculated from the joint cdf if \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are all integers? * Determine the joint cdf for the scenario of Example 5.1. [_Hint_: First determine _F_(_x_, _y_) for \(x\) = 100, 250 and \(y\) = 0, 100, and 200. Then describe the joint cdf for various other (_x_, _y_) pairs.] * Determine the joint cdf for the scenario of Example 5.3 and use it to calculate the probability that \(X\) and \(Y\) are both between.25 and.75. [_Hint_: For 0 \(\leq x\leq 1\) and 0 \(\leq y\leq 1\), \(F(x,y) = \int_{0}^{x}\int_{0}^{y}f(u,v)dvdu\)] * Determine the joint cdf for the scenario of Example 5.5. [_Hint_: Proceed as in (d), but be careful about the order of integration and consider separately (_x_, _y_) points that lie inside the triangular region of positive density and then points that lie outside this region.]
90. A circular sampling region with radius \(X\) is chosen by a biologist, where \(X\) has an exponential distribution with mean value 10 ft. Plants of a certain type occur in this region according to a (spatial) Poisson process with "rate".5 plant per square foot. Let \(Y\) denote the number of plants in the region. * Find \(E(Y|X=x)\) and \(V(Y|X=x)\) * Use part (a) to find _E_(_Y_). * Use part (a) to find _V_(_Y_).
91. The number of individuals arriving at a post office to mail packages during a certain period is a Poisson random variable \(X\) with mean value 20. Independently of the others, any particular customer will mail either 1, 2, 3, or 4 packages with probabilities.4,.3,.2, and.1, respectively. Let \(Y\) denote the total number of packages mailed during this time period. * Find \(E(Y|X=x)\) and \(V(Y|X=x)\). * Use part (a) to find _E_(_Y_). * Use part (a) to find _V_(_Y_).
92. Consider a sealed-bid auction in which each of the \(n\) bidders has his/her valuation (assessment of inherent worth) of the item being auctioned. The valuation of any particular bidder is not known to the other bidders. Suppose these valuations constitute a random sample \(X_{1},...,X_{n}\) from a distribution with cdf _F_(_x_), with corresponding order statistics \(Y_{1}\leq Y_{2}\leq\cdots\leq Y_{n}\). The _rent_ of the winning bidder is the difference between the winner's valuation and the price. The article "Mean Sample Spacings, Sample Size and Variability in an Auction-Theoretic Framework" (_Oper. Res. Lett._, 2004: 103-108) argues that the rent is just \(Y_{n}-Y_{n-1}\) (why?) * Suppose that the valuation distribution is uniform on [0, 100]. What is the expected rent when there are \(n\) = 10 bidders? * Referring back to (a), what happens when there are 11 bidders? More generally, what is the relationship between the expected rent for \(n\) bidders and for \(n\) + 1 bidders? Is this intuitive? [_Note_: The cited article presents a counter-example.]
93. Suppose two identical components are connected in parallel, so the system continues to function as long as at least one of the components does so. The two lifetimes are independent of each other, each having an exponential distribution with mean 1000 h. Let \(W\) denote system lifetime. Obtain the moment generating function of \(W\), and use it to calculate the expected lifetime.

## Chapter 1 Statistics and Sampling Distributions

### 1.1 Introduction

This chapter helps make the transition between probability and inferential statistics. Given a sample of \(n\) observations from a population, we will be calculating estimates of the population mean, median, standard deviation, and various other population characteristics (parameters). Prior to obtaining data, there is uncertainty as to which of all possible samples will occur. Because of this, estimates such as \(\bar{x}\), \(\bar{x}\), and \(s\) will vary from one sample to another. The behavior of such estimates in repeated sampling is described by what are called _sampling distributions_. Any particular sampling distribution will give an indication of how close the estimate is likely to be to the value of the parameter being estimated.

The first three sections use probability results to study sampling distributions. A particularly important result is the Central Limit Theorem, which shows how the behavior of the sample mean can be described by a particular normal distribution when the sample size is large. The last section introduces several distributions related to normal samples. These distributions play a major role in the rest of the book.

## Chapter 6 Statistics and Their Distributions

The observations in a single sample were denoted in Chapter 1 by \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\). Consider selecting two different samples of size \(n\) from the same population distribution. The \(x_{i}\)'s in the second sample will virtually always differ at least a bit from those in the first sample. For example, a first sample of \(n=3\) cars of a particular model might result in fuel efficiencies \(x_{1}=30.7\), \(x_{2}=29.4\), \(x_{3}=31.1\), whereas a second sample may give \(x_{1}=28.8\), \(x_{2}=30.0\), and \(x_{3}=31.1\). Before we obtain data, there is uncertainty about the value of each \(x_{i}\). Because of this uncertainty, _before_ the data becomes available we view each observation as a random variable and denote the sample by \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) (uppercase letters for random variables).

This variation in observed values in turn implies that the value of any function of the sample observations--such as the sample mean, sample standard deviation, or sample fourth spread--also varies from sample to sample. That is, prior to obtaining \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\), there is uncertainty as to the value of \(\bar{x}\), the value of \(s\), and so on.

Suppose that material strength for a randomly selected specimen of a particular type has a Weibull distribution with parameter values \(\alpha=2\) (shape) and \(\beta=5\) (scale). The corresponding density curve is shown in Figure 6. Formulas from Section 4.5 give

\[\mu=E(X)=4.4311\qquad\tilde{\mu}=4.1628\qquad\sigma^{2}=V(X)=5.365\qquad\sigma =2.316\]

The mean exceeds the median because of the distribution's positive skew.

We used MINITAB to generate six different samples, each with \(n=10\), from this distribution (material strengths for six different groups of ten specimens each). The results appear in Table 6.1, followed by the values of the sample mean, sample median, and sample standard deviation for each sample. Notice first that the ten observations in any particular sample are all different from those in any other sample. Second, the six values of the sample mean are all different from each other, as are the six values of the sample median and the six values of the sample standard deviation. The same is true of the sample 10% trimmed means, sample fourth spreads, and so on.

Figure 6.1: The Weibull density curve for Example 6.1Furthermore, the value of the sample mean from any particular sample can be regarded as a _point estimate_ ("point" because it is a single number, corresponding to a single point on the number line) of the population mean \(\mu\), whose value is known to be 4.4311. None of the estimates from these six samples is identical to what is being estimated. The estimates from the second and sixth samples are much too large, whereas the fifth sample gives a substantial underestimate. Similarly, the sample standard deviation gives a point estimate of the population standard deviation. All six of the resulting estimates are in error by at least a small amount.

In summary, the values of the individual sample observations vary from sample to sample, so in general the value of any quantity computed from sample data, and the value of a sample characteristic used as an estimate of the corresponding population characteristic, will virtually never coincide with what is being estimated.

* A **statistic** is any quantity whose value can be calculated from sample data. Prior to obtaining data, there is uncertainty as to what value of any particular statistic will result. Therefore, a statistic is a random variable and will be denoted by an uppercase letter; a lowercase letter is used to represent the calculated or observed value of the statistic.

Thus the sample mean, regarded as a statistic (before a sample has been selected or an experiment has been carried out), is denoted by \(\overline{X}\); the calculated value of this statistic is \(\bar{x}\). Similarly, \(S\) represents the sample standard deviation thought of as a statistic, and its computed value is \(s\). Suppose a drug is given to a

\begin{table} \end{table}
Table 1: Samples from the Weibull distribution of Example 6.1sample of patients, another drug is given to a second sample, and the cholesterol levels are denoted by \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{m}\) and \(Y_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{n}\), respectively. Then the statistic \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\), the difference between the two sample mean cholesterol levels, may be important.

Any statistic, being a random variable, has a probability distribution. In particular, the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) has a probability distribution. Suppose, for example, that \(n=2\) components are randomly selected and the number of breakdowns while under warranty is determined for each one. Possible values for the sample mean number of breakdowns \(\overline{X}\) are 0 (if \(X_{1}=X_{2}=0\)),.5 (if either \(X_{1}=0\) and \(X_{2}=1\) or \(X_{1}=1\) and \(X_{2}=0\)), 1, 1.5, \(\ldots\). The probability distribution of \(\overline{X}\) specifies \(P(\overline{X}=0)\), \(P(\overline{X}=.5)\) and so on, from which other probabilities such as \(P(1\leq\overline{X}\leq 3)\) and \(P(\overline{X}\geq 2.5)\) can be calculated. Similarly, if for a sample of size \(n=2\), the only possible values of the sample variance are 0, 12.5, and 50 (which is the case if \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) can each take on only the values 40, 45, and 50), then the probability distribution of \(S^{2}\) gives \(P(S^{2}=0)\), \(P(S^{2}=12.5)\), and \(P(S^{2}=50)\). The probability distribution of a statistic is sometimes referred to as its **sampling distribution** to emphasize that it describes how the statistic varies in value across all samples that might be selected.

### Random Samples

The probability distribution of any particular statistic depends not only on the population distribution (normal, uniform, etc.) and the sample size \(n\) but also on the method of sampling. Consider selecting a sample of size \(n=2\) from a population consisting of just the three values 1, 5, and 10, and suppose that the statistic of interest is the sample variance. If sampling is done "with replacement," then \(S^{2}=0\) will result if \(X_{1}=X_{2}\). However, \(S^{2}\) cannot equal 0 if sampling is "without replacement." So \(P(S^{2}=0)=0\) for one sampling method, and this probability is positive for the other method. Our next definition describes a sampling method often encountered (at least approximately) in practice.

The rv's \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) are said to form a (simple) **random sample** of size \(n\) if

1. The \(X_{i}\)'s are independent rv's.
2. Every \(X_{i}\) has the same probability distribution.

Conditions 1 and 2 can be paraphrased by saying that the \(X_{i}\)'s are _independent and identically distributed_ (iid). If sampling is either with replacement or from an infinite (conceptual) population, Conditions 1 and 2 are satisfied exactly. These conditions will be approximately satisfied if sampling is without replacement, yet the sample size \(n\) is much smaller than the population size \(N\). In practice, if \(n/N\leq.05\) (at most 5% of the population is sampled), we can proceed as if the \(X_{i}\)'s form a random sample. The virtue of this sampling method is that the probability distribution of any statistic can be more easily obtained than for any other sampling method.

There are two general methods for obtaining information about a statistic's sampling distribution. One method involves calculations based on probability rules, and the other involves carrying out a simulation experiment.

### Deriving the Sampling Distribution of a Statistic

Probability rules can be used to obtain the distribution of a statistic provided that it is a "fairly simple" function of the \(X_{i}\)'s and either there are relatively few different \(X\) values in the population or else the population distribution has a "nice" form. Our next two examples illustrate such situations.

A certain brand of MP3 player comes in three configurations: with 2 GB of memory, costing $80, a 4 GB model priced at $100, and an 8 GB version with a price tag of $120. If 20% of all purchasers choose the 2 GB model, 30% choose the 4 GB, and 50% choose the 8 GB model, then the probability distribution of the cost of a single randomly selected MP3 player purchase is given by

\[x \approx 100\]

\[\text{with }\mu = 106\]

,

\[\sigma^{2} = 244\]

 (6.1)

Suppose only two MP3 players are sold today. Let \(X_{1}=\) the cost of the first player and \(X_{2}=\) the cost of the second. Suppose that \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are independent, each with the probability distribution shown in (6.1), so that \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) constitute a random sample from the distribution (6.1). Table 6.2 lists possible (\(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\)) pairs, the probability of each computed using (6.1) and the assumption of independence, and the resulting \(\bar{x}\) and \(s^{2}\) values. (When \(n=2\), \(s^{2}=\left(x_{1}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}+\left(x_{2}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}\).)

Now to obtain the probability distribution of \(\overline{X}\), the sample average cost per MP3 player, we must consider each possible value \(\bar{x}\) and compute its probability. For example, \(\bar{x}=100\) occurs three times in the table with probabilities.10,.09, and.10, so

\[P(\overline{X}=100)=.10+.09+.10=.29\]Similarly, \(s^{2}=800\) appears twice in the table with probability.10 each time, so

\[P(S^{2}=800) = P(X_{1}=80,X_{2}=120)+P(X_{1}=120,X_{2}=80)\] \[=.10+.10=.20\]

The complete sampling distributions of \(\overline{X}\) and \(S^{2}\) appear in (6.2) and (6.3).

\[\bar{x} \approx 80\] 90 100 110 120 \[\overline{p_{\overline{X}}(\bar{x})} \approx.2\] 12.29.30.5 \[s^{2} \approx 0\] 200 800 \[\overline{p_{S^{2}}(s^{2})} \approx.38\] 42.20

Figure 6.2 pictures a probability histogram for both the original distribution of \(X\) (6.1) and the \(\overline{X}\) distribution (6.2). The figure suggests first that the mean (i.e. expected value) of \(\overline{X}\) is equal to the mean $106 of the original distribution, since both histograms appear to be centered at the same place. Indeed, from (6.2),

\[E(\overline{X})=\sum\bar{x}p_{\overline{X}}(\bar{x})=80(.04)+\cdots+120(.25)=1 06=\mu\]

Second, it appears that the \(\overline{X}\) distribution has smaller spread (variability) than the original distribution, since the values of \(\bar{x}\) are more concentrated toward the mean. Again from (6.2),

\[V(\overline{X})=\sum{(\bar{x}-\mu)}^{2}p_{\overline{X}}(\bar{x})=\sum{(\bar{x} -106)}^{2}p_{\overline{X}}(\bar{x})\]

\[=(80-106)^{2}(.04)+\cdots+(120-106)^{2}(.25)=122\]

Notice that the \(V(\overline{X})=122=244/2=\sigma^{2}/2\), is exactly half the population variance; the division by 2 here is a consequence of the fact that \(n=2\).

Finally, the mean value of \(S^{2}\) is

\[E(S^{2})=\sum{s^{2}p_{S^{2}}(s^{2})}=0(.38)+200(.42)+800(.20)=244=\sigma^{2}\]

That is, the \(\overline{X}\) sampling distribution is centered at the population mean \(\mu\), and the \(S^{2}\) sampling distribution (histogram not shown) is centered at the population variance \(\sigma^{2}\).

If four MP3 players had been purchased on the day of interest, the sample average cost \(\overline{X}\) would be based on a random sample of four \(X_{i}\)s, each having the distribution (6.1). More calculation eventually yields the distribution of \(\overline{X}\) for \(n=4\) as

\[\bar{x} \approx 80\] 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 \[\overline{p_{\overline{X}}(\bar{x})} \approx.0016\].0096.0376.0936.1761.2340.2350.1500.0625

Figure 6.2: Probability histograms for (a) the underlying population distribution and (b) the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\) in Example 6.2

From this, \(E(\overline{X})=106=\mu\) and \(V(\overline{X})=61=\sigma^{2}/4\). Figure 6.3 is a probability histogram of this distribution.

Example 6.2 should suggest first of all that the computation of \(p_{\overline{X}}(\overline{x})\) and \(p_{S^{2}}(s^{2})\) can be tedious. If the original distribution (6.1) had allowed for more than three possible values 80, 100, and 120, then even for \(n=2\) the computations would have been more involved. The example should also suggest, however, that there are some general relationships between \(E(\overline{X}),\ V(\overline{X}),\ E(S^{2})\), and the mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\) of the original distribution. These are stated in the next section. Now consider an example in which the random sample is drawn from a continuous distribution.

The time that it takes to serve a customer at the cash register in a minimarket is a random variable having an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda\). Suppose \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are service times for two different customers, assumed independent of each other. Consider the total service time \(T_{\text{o}}=X_{1}+X_{2}\) for the two customers, also a statistic. The cdf of \(T_{\text{o}}\) is, for \(t\geq 0\),

\[F_{T_{0}}(t) =P(X_{1}+X_{2}\leq t)=\underset{\{(x_{1},x_{2}):x_{1}+x_{2}\leq t \}}{\int}f(x_{1},x_{2})\ dx_{1}\ dx_{2}\] \[=\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t-x_{1}}\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{1}}\cdot \lambda e^{-\lambda x_{2}}\ dx_{2}\ dx_{1}\] \[=\int_{0}^{t}\left(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{1}}-\lambda e^{- \lambda t}\right)\ dx_{1}=1-e^{-\lambda t}-\lambda te^{-\lambda t}\]

The region of integration is pictured in Figure 6.4.

Figure 6.4: Region of integration to obtain cdf of \(T_{\text{o}}\) in Example 6.3

Figure 6.3: Probability histogram for \(\overline{X}\) based on \(n=4\) in Example 6.2

The pdf of \(T_{\text{o}}\) is obtained by differentiating \(F_{T_{\text{o}}}(t)\):

\[f_{T_{\text{o}}}(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\lambda^{2}te^{-\lambda t}&t\geq 0 \\ 0&t<0\end{array}\right. \tag{6.4}\]

This is a gamma pdf (\(\alpha=2\) and \(\beta=1/\lambda\)). This distribution for \(T_{\text{o}}\) can also be derived by a moment generating function argument.

The pdf of \(\overline{X}=T_{0}/2\) can be obtained by the method of Section 4.7 as

\[f_{\overline{X}}(\bar{x})=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}4\lambda^{2}\bar{x}e^{-2 \lambda\bar{x}}&\bar{x}\geq 0\\ 0&\bar{x}<0\end{array}\right. \tag{6.5}\]

The mean and variance of the underlying exponential distribution are \(\mu=1/\lambda\) and \(\sigma^{2}=1/\lambda^{2}\). Using Expressions (6.4) and (6.5), it can be verified that \(E(\overline{X})=1/\lambda,\ V(\overline{X})=1/(2\lambda^{2}),\ E(T_{0})=2/\lambda\), and \(V(T_{0})=2/\lambda^{2}\). These results again suggest some general relationships between means and variances of \(\overline{X}\), \(T_{0}\), and the underlying distribution. 

### Simulation Experiments

The second method of obtaining information about a statistic's sampling distribution is to perform a simulation experiment. This method is usually used when a derivation via probability rules is too difficult or complicated to be carried out. Such an experiment is virtually always done with the aid of a computer. The following characteristics of an experiment must be specified:

**1.**: The statistic of interest (\(\overline{X}\), \(S\), a particular trimmed mean, etc.)
**2.**: The population distribution (normal with \(\mu=100\) and \(\sigma=15\), uniform with lower limit \(A=5\) and upper limit \(B=10\), etc.)
**3.**: The sample size \(n\) (e.g., \(n=10\) or \(n=50\))
**4.**: The number of replications \(k\) (e.g., \(k=1000\))

Then use a computer to obtain \(k\) different random samples, each of size \(n\), from the designated population distribution. For each such sample, calculate the value of the statistic and construct a histogram of the \(k\) calculated values. This histogram gives the _approximate_ sampling distribution of the statistic. The larger the value of \(k\), the better the approximation will tend to be (the actual sampling distribution emerges as \(k\rightarrow\infty\)). In practice, \(k=1000\) may be enough for a "fairly simple" statistic and population distribution, but modern computers allow a much larger number of replications.

The population distribution for our first simulation study is normal with \(\mu=8.25\) and \(\sigma=.75\), as pictured in Figure 6.5. [The article "Platelet Size in Myocardial Infarction" (_British Med. J._, 1983: 449-451) suggests this distribution for platelet volume in individuals with no history of serious heart problems.]

We actually performed four different experiments, with 500 replications for each one. In the first experiment, 500 samples of \(n=5\) observations each were generated using MINITAB, and the sample sizes for the other three were \(n=10\), \(n=20\), and \(n=30\), respectively. The sample mean was calculated for each sample, and the resulting histograms of \(\bar{x}\) valuesFigure 6.5: Normal distribution, with \(\mu=8.25\) and \(\sigma=.75\)

Figure 6.6: Sample histograms for \(\overline{X}\) based on 500 samples, each consisting of \(n\) observations: (a) \(n=5\); (b) \(n=10\); (c) \(n=20\); (d) \(n=30\)

The first thing to notice about the histograms is their shape. To a reasonable approximation, each of the four looks like a normal curve. The resemblance would be even more striking if each histogram had been based on many more than 500 \(\bar{x}\) values. Second, each histogram is centered approximately at 8.25, the mean of the population being sampled. Had the histograms been based on an unending sequence of \(\bar{x}\) values, their centers would have been exactly the population mean, 8.25.

The final aspect of the histograms to note is their spread relative to each other. The smaller the value of \(n\), the greater the extent to which the sampling distribution spreads out about the mean value. This is why the histograms for \(n=20\) and \(n=30\) are based on narrower class intervals than those for the two smaller sample sizes. For the larger sample sizes, most of the \(\bar{x}\) values are quite close to 8.25. This is the effect of averaging. When \(n\) is small, a single unusual \(x\) value can result in an \(\bar{x}\) value far from the center. With a larger sample size, any unusual \(x\) values, when averaged in with the other sample values, still tend to yield an \(\bar{x}\) value close to \(\mu\). Combining these insights yields a result that should appeal to your intuition: \(\overline{X}\)_based on a large \(n\) tends to be closer to \(\mu\) than does \(\overline{X}\) based on a small \(n\)_. 

Consider a simulation experiment in which the population distribution is quite skewed. Figure 6.7 shows the density curve for lifetimes of a certain type of electronic control (This is actually a lognormal distribution with \(E[\ln(X)]=3\) and \(V[\ln(X)]=.16\); that is, \(\ln(X)\) is normal with mean 3 and variance.16.). Again the statistic of interest is the sample mean \(\overline{X}\). The experiment utilized 500 replications and considered the same four sample sizes as in Example 6.4. The resulting histograms along with a normal probability plot from MINITAB for the 500 \(\bar{x}\) values based on \(n=30\) are shown in Figure 6.8.

Unlike the normal case, these histograms all differ in shape. In particular, they become progressively less skewed as the sample size \(n\) increases. The averages of the 500 \(\bar{x}\) values for the four different sample sizes are all quite close to the mean value of the population distribution. If each histogram had been based on an

Figure 6.7: Density curve for the simulation experiment of Example 6.5 [\(E[X]=\mu=21.7584\), \(V[X]=\sigma^{2}=82.1449\)]

unending sequence of \(\bar{x}\) values rather than just 500, all four would have been centered at exactly 21.7584. Thus different values of \(n\) change the shape but not the center of the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\). Comparison of the four histograms in Figure 6.8 also shows that as \(n\) increases, the spread of the histograms decreases. Increasing \(n\) results in a greater degree of concentration about the population mean value and makes the histogram look more like a normal curve. The histogram of Figure 6.8(d) and the normal probability plot in Figure 6.8(e) provide convincing evidence that a sample size of \(n=30\) is sufficient to overcome the skewness of the population distribution and give an approximately normal \(\overline{X}\) sampling distribution.

## 6.2 The Distribution of the Sample Mean

The importance of the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) springs from its use in drawing conclusions about the population mean \(\mu\). Some of the most frequently used inferential procedures are based on properties of the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\). A preview of these properties appeared in the calculations and simulation experiments of the previous section, where we noted relationships between \(E(\overline{X})\) and \(\mu\) and also among \(V(\overline{X})\), \(\sigma^{2}\), and \(n\).

**Proposition**: Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a distribution with mean value \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). Then

**1.**: \(E(\overline{X})=\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu\)
**2.**: \(V(\overline{X})=\sigma_{\overline{X}}^{2}=\sigma^{2}/n\) and \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)

In addition, with \(T_{\text{o}}=X_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+X_{n}\) (the sample total), \(E(T_{\text{o}})=n\mu\), \(V(T_{\text{o}})=n\sigma^{2}\), and \(\sigma_{T_{0}}=\sqrt{n}\sigma\).

Proofs of these results are deferred to the next section. According to Result 1, the sampling (i.e., probability) distribution of \(\overline{X}\) is centered precisely at the mean of the population from which the sample has been selected. Result 2 shows that the \(\overline{X}\) distribution becomes more concentrated about \(\mu\) as the sample size \(n\) increases. In marked contrast, the distribution of \(T_{\text{o}}\) becomes more spread out as \(n\) increases. Averaging moves probability in toward the middle, whereas totaling spreads probability out over a wider and wider range of values.

The amount of time that a patient spends in a certain outpatient surgery center is a random variable with a mean value of 4.5 h. and a standard deviation of 2 h. Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{25}\) be the times for a random sample of 25 patients. Then the expected value of the sample mean amount of time is \(E(\overline{X})=\mu=4.5\), and the expected total time for the 25 patients is \(E(T_{0})=n\mu=25(4.5)=112.5\). The standard deviations of \(\overline{X}\) and \(T_{0}\) are

\[\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{25}}=.4\]

\[\sigma_{T_{0}}=\sqrt{n}\sigma=\sqrt{25}(2)=10\]

If the sample size increases to \(n=100\), \(E(\overline{X})\) is unchanged, but \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=.2\), half of its previous value (the sample size must be quadrupled to halve the standard deviation of \(\overline{X}\)). 

## The Case of a Normal Population Distribution

Looking back to the simulation experiment of Example 6.4, we see that when the population distribution is normal, each histogram of \(\bar{x}\) values is well approximated by a normal curve. The precise result follows (see the next section for a derivation).

**Proposition**: Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a _normal_ distribution with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). Then for _any_\(n\), \(\overline{X}\) is normally distributed (with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)), as is \(T_{\text{o}}\) (with mean \(n\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sqrt{n}\sigma\)).

We know everything there is to know about the \(\overline{X}\) and \(T_{o}\) distributions when the population distribution is normal. In particular, probabilities such as \(P(a\leq\overline{X}\leq b)\) and \(P(c\leq T_{\text{o}}\leq d)\) can be obtained simply by standardizing. Figure 6.9 illustrates the proposition.

Figure 6.9: A normal population distribution and \(\overline{X}\) sampling distributions

The time that it takes a randomly selected rat of a certain subspecies to find its way through a maze is a normally distributed rv with \(\mu=1.5\) min and \(\sigma=.35\) min. Suppose five rats are selected. Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{5}\) denote their times in the maze. Assuming the \(X_{i}\)'s to be a random sample from this normal distribution, what is the probability that the total time \(T_{\text{o}}=X_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+X_{5}\) for the five is between 6 and 8 min? By the proposition, \(T_{\text{o}}\) has a normal distribution with \(\mu_{T_{\text{0}}}=n\mu=5(1.5)=7.5\) and variance \(\sigma_{T_{\text{0}}}^{2}=n\sigma^{2}=5(.1225)=.6125\), so \(\sigma_{T_{\text{0}}}=.783\). To standardize \(T_{\text{o}}\), subtract \(\mu_{T_{\text{0}}}\) and divide by \(\sigma_{T_{\text{0}}}\):

\[P(6\leq T_{\text{0}}\leq 8) =P\left(\frac{6-7.5}{.783}\leq Z\leq\frac{8-7.5}{.783}\right)=P(-1.92\leq Z\leq.64)\] \[=\Phi(.64)-\Phi(-1.92)=.7115\]

Determination of the probability that the sample average time \(\overline{X}\) (a normally distributed variable) is at most 2.0 min requires \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu=1.5\) and \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}=.35/\sqrt{5}=.1565\). Then

\[P(\overline{X}\leq 2.0)=P\left(Z\leq\frac{2.0-1.5}{.1565}\right)=P\left(Z \leq 3.19\right)=\Phi(3.19)=.9993\]

### The Central Limit Theorem

When the \(X_{i}\)'s are normally distributed, so is \(\overline{X}\) for every sample size \(n\). The simulation experiment of Example 6.5 suggests that even when the population distribution is highly nonnormal, averaging produces a distribution more bell-shaped than the one being sampled. A reasonable conjecture is that if \(n\) is large, a suitable normal curve will approximate the actual distribution of \(\overline{X}\). The formal statement of this result is the most important theorem of probability.

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) \\  & Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Then, in the limit as \(n\rightarrow\infty\), the standardized versions of \(\overline{X}\) and \(T_{\text{0}}\) have the standard normal distribution. That is, \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\  & \\ \end{tabular}

and

\[\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P\left(\frac{T_{\text{0}}-n\mu}{\sqrt{n\sigma}}\leq z \right)=P(Z\leq z)=\Phi(z)\]

where \(Z\) is a standard normal rv. As an alternative to saying that the standardized versions of \(\overline{X}\) and \(T_{\text{0}}\) have limiting standard normal distributions, it is customary to say that \(\overline{X}\) and \(T_{\text{0}}\) are **asymptotically normal**. Thus when \(n\) is sufficiently large, \(\overline{X}\) has approximately a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu\) and variance \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}^{2}=\sigma^{2}/n\). Equivalently, for large \(n\) the sum \(T_{\text{0}}\) has approximately a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_{T_{\text{0}}}=n\mu\) and variance \(\sigma_{T_{\text{0}}}^{2}=n\sigma^{2}\).

A partial proof of the CLT appears in the appendix to this chapter. It is shown that, if the moment generating function exists, then the mgf of the standardized \(\overline{X}\) (and \(T_{0}\)) approaches the standard normal mgf. With the aid of an advanced probability theorem, this implies the CLT statement about convergence of probabilities.

Figure 6.10 illustrates the Central Limit Theorem. According to the CLT, when \(n\) is large and we wish to calculate a probability such as \(P(a\leq\overline{X}\leq b)\), we need only "pretend" that \(\overline{X}\) is normal, standardize it, and use the normal table. The resulting answer will be approximately correct. The exact answer could be obtained only by first finding the distribution of \(\overline{X}\), so the CLT provides a truly impressive shortcut.

When a batch of a certain chemical product is prepared, the amount of a particular impurity in the batch is a random variable with mean value 4.0 g and standard deviation 1.5 g. If 50 batches are independently prepared, what is the (approximate) probability that the sample average amount of impurity \(\overline{X}\) is between 3.5 and 3.8 g? According to the rule of thumb to be stated shortly, \(n=50\) is large enough for the CLT to be applicable. The mean \(\overline{X}\) then has approximately a normal distribution with mean value \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=4.0\) and \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=1.5/\sqrt{50}=.2121\), so

\[P(3.5\leq\overline{X}\leq 3.8) =P\biggl{(}\frac{3.5-4.0}{.2121}\leq Z\leq\frac{3.8-4.0}{.2121} \biggr{)}\] \[=\Phi(-.94)-\Phi(-2.36)=.1645\]

Suppose the number of times a randomly selected customer of a large bank uses the bank's ATM during a particular period is a random variable with a mean value of 3.2 and a standard deviation of 2.4. Among 100 randomly selected customers, how likely is it that the sample mean number of times the bank's ATM is used exceeds 4? Let \(X_{i}\) denote the number of times the \(i\)th customer in the sample uses the bank's ATM. Notice that \(X_{i}\) is a discrete rv, but the CLT is not limited to continuous random variables. Also, although the fact that the standard deviation of this nonnegative variable is quite large relative to the mean value suggests

Figure 6.10: The Central Limit Theorem illustrated

that its distribution is positively skewed, the large sample size implies that \(\overline{X}\) does have approximately a normal distribution. Using \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=3.2\) and \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=.24\),

\[P(\overline{X}>4)\approx P\bigg{(}Z>\frac{4-3.2}{.24}\bigg{)}=1-\Phi(3.33)=.0004\]

Consider the distribution shown in Figure 6.11 for the amount purchased (rounded to the nearest dollar) by a randomly selected customer at a particular gas station (a similar distribution for purchases in Britain (in PS) appeared in the article "Data Mining for Fun and Profit", _Statistical Science_, 2000: 111-131; there were big spikes at the values 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30). The distribution is obviously quite non-normal.

We asked MINITAB to select 1000 different samples, each consisting of \(n=15\) observations, and calculate the value of the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) for each one. Figure 6.12 is a histogram of the resulting 1000 values; this is the approximate sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\) under the specified circumstances. This distribution is clearly approximately normal even though the sample size is not all that large. As further evidence for normality, Figure 6.13 shows a normal probability plot of the 1000 \(\bar{x}\) values; the linear pattern is very prominent. It is typically not non-normality in the central part of the population distribution that causes the CLT to fail, but instead very substantial skewness.

Figure 6.11: Probability distribution of \(X=\) amount of gasoline purchased (S)

A practical difficulty in applying the CLT is in knowing when \(n\) is sufficiently large. The problem is that the accuracy of the approximation for a particular \(n\) depends on the shape of the original underlying distribution being sampled. If the underlying distribution is symmetric and there is not much probability in the tails, then the approximation will be good even for a small \(n\), whereas if it is highly skewed or there is a lot of probability in the tails, then a large \(n\) will be required. For example, if the distribution is uniform on an interval, then it is symmetric with no probability in the tails, and the normal approximation is very good for \(n\) as

Figure 12: Approximate sampling distribution of the sample mean amount purchased when \(n=15\) and the population distribution is as shown in Figure 11

Figure 13: Normal probability plot from MINITAB of the 1000 \(\bar{\chi}\) values based on samples of size \(n=15\)

small as 10. However, at the other extreme, a distribution can have such fat tails that the mean fails to exist and the Central Limit Theorem does not apply, so no \(n\) is big enough. We will use the following rule of thumb, which is frequently somewhat conservative.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{If \(n>30\), the Central Limit Theorem can be used.} \\ THUMB & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} Of course, there are exceptions, but this rule applies to most distributions of real data.

### Other Applications of the Central Limit Theorem

The CLT can be used to justify the normal approximation to the binomial distribution discussed in Chapter 4. Recall that a binomial variable \(X\) is the number of successes in a binomial experiment consisting of \(n\) independent success/failure trials with \(p=P(S)\) for any particular trial. Define new rv's \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) by

\[X_{i}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1&\mbox{if the $i$th trial results in a success}\\ 0&\mbox{if the $i$th trial results in a failure}\end{array}\right.\qquad(i=1,\ldots,n)\]

Because the trials are independent and \(P(S)\) is constant from trial to trial, the \(X_{i}\)'s are iid (a random sample from a Bernoulli distribution). The CLT then implies that if \(n\) is sufficiently large, both the sum and the average of the \(X_{i}\)'s have approximately normal distributions. When the \(X_{i}\)'s are summed, a 1 is added for every \(S\) that occurs and a 0 for every \(F\), so \(X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}=X=T_{0}\). The sample mean of the \(X_{i}\)'s is \(\overline{X}=X/n\), the sample proportion of successes. That is, both \(X\) and \(X/n\) are approximately normal when \(n\) is large. The necessary sample size for this approximation depends on the value of \(p\): When \(p\) is close to.5, the distribution of each \(X_{i}\) is reasonably symmetric (see Figure 6.14), whereas the distribution is quite skewed when \(p\) is near 0 or 1. Using the approximation only if both \(np\geq 10\) and \(n(1-p)\geq 10\) ensures that \(n\) is large enough to overcome any skewness in the underlying Bernoulli distribution.

Recall from Section 4.5 that \(X\) has a lognormal distribution if \(\ln(X)\) has a normal distribution.

Figure 6.14: Two Bernoulli distributions: (a) \(p=.4\) (reasonably symmetric); (b) \(p=.1\) (very skewed)

Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a distribution for which only positive values are possible [\(P(X_{i}>0)=1\)]. Then if \(n\) is sufficiently large, the product \(Y=X_{1}\,X_{2}\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot X_{n}\) has approximately a lognormal distribution; that is, \(\ln(Y)\) has a normal distribution.

To verify this, note that

\[\ln(Y)=\ln(X_{1})+\ln(X_{2})+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\ln(X_{n})\]

Since \(\ln\) (\(Y\)) is a sum of independent and identically distributed rv's [the \(\ln(X_{i})\)'s], it is approximately normal when \(n\) is large, so \(Y\) itself has approximately a lognormal distribution. As an example of the applicability of this result, it has been argued that the damage process in plastic flow and crack propagation is a multiplicative process, so that variables such as percentage elongation and rupture strength have approximately lognormal distributions.

## The Law of Large Numbers

Recall the first proposition in this section: If \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) is a random sample from a distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), then \(E(\overline{X})=\mu\) and \(V(\overline{X})=\sigma^{2}/n\). What happens to \(\overline{X}\) as the number of observations becomes large? The expected value of \(\overline{X}\) remains at \(\mu\) but the variance approaches zero. That is, \(V(\overline{X})=E[(\overline{X}-\mu)]^{{}^{2}}\to 0\). We say that \(\overline{X}\) converges _in mean square_ to \(\mu\) because the mean of the squared difference between \(\overline{X}\) and \(\mu\) goes to zero. This is one form of the _Law of Large Numbers_, which says that \(\overline{X}\rightarrow\mu\) as \(n\rightarrow\infty\).

The law of large numbers should be intuitively reasonable. For example, consider a fair die with equal probabilities for the values 1, 2, \(\ldots\), 6 so \(\mu=3.5\). After many repeated throws of the die \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\), we should be surprised if \(\bar{x}\) is not close to 3.5.

Another form of convergence can be shown with the help of Chebyshev's inequality (Exercises 43 and 135 in Chapter 3), which states that for any random variable \(Y\), \(P(\,|\,Y-\mu\,|\,\geq\,k\sigma)\leq 1/k^{2}\) whenever \(k\geq 1\). In words, the probability that \(Y\) is at least \(k\) standard deviations away from its mean value is at most 1/\(k^{2}\); as \(k\) increases, the probability gets closer to 0. Apply this to the mean \(Y=\overline{X}\) of a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) from a distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Then \(E(Y)=E(\overline{X})=\mu\) and \(V(Y)=V(\overline{X})=\sigma^{2}/n\), so the \(\sigma\) in Chebyshev's inequality needs to be replaced by \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). Now let \(\varepsilon\) be a positive number close to 0, such as.01 or.001, and consider \(P(|\overline{X}-\mu|\geq\varepsilon)\), the probability that \(\overline{X}\) differs from \(\mu\) by at least \(\varepsilon\) (at least.01, at least.001, etc.). What happens to this probability as \(n\rightarrow\infty\)? Setting \(\varepsilon=k\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) and solving for \(k\) gives \(k=\varepsilon\sqrt{n}/\sigma\). Thus

\[P(|\overline{X}-\mu|\geq\varepsilon)=P\left[|\overline{X}-\mu|\geq\frac{ \varepsilon\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right]\leq\frac{1}{ \left(\frac{\varepsilon\sqrt{n}}{\sigma}\right)^{2}}=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n \varepsilon^{2}}\]

so as \(n\) gets arbitrarily large, the probability will approach 0 regardless of how small \(\varepsilon\) is. That is, for _any_\(\varepsilon\), the chance that \(\overline{X}\) will differ from \(\mu\) by at least \(\varepsilon\)decreases to 0 as the sample size increases. Because of this, statisticians say that \(\overline{X}\)_converges to \(\mu\) in probability_.

We can summarize the two forms of the Law of Large Numbers in the following theorem.

If \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) is a random sample from a distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), then \(\overline{X}\) converges to \(\mu\)

**a.**: In mean square: \(E[(\overline{X}-\mu)]^{2}\to 0\) as \(n\rightarrow\infty\)
**b.**: In probability: \(P([\overline{X}-\mu]\geq\varepsilon)\to 0\) as \(n\rightarrow\infty\) for any \(\varepsilon>0\)

Often we do not know \(\mu\) so we use \(\overline{X}\) to estimate it. According to the theorem, \(\overline{X}\) will be an accurate estimator if \(n\) is large. Estimators that are close for large \(n\) are called _consistent_.

Let's apply the Law of Large Numbers to the repeated flipping of a fair coin. Intuitively, the fraction of heads should approach \(\frac{1}{2}\) as we get more and more coin flips. For \(i=1\), \(\ldots n\), let \(X_{i}=1\) if the \(ith\) toss is a head and \(=0\) if it is a tail. Then the \(X_{i}\)'s are independent and each \(X_{i}\) is a Bernoulli rv with \(\mu=.5\) and standard deviation \(\sigma=.5\). Furthermore, the sum \(X_{1}+X_{2}+\ldots+X_{n}\) is the total number of heads, so \(\overline{X}\) is the fraction of heads. Thus, the fraction of heads approaches the mean, \(\mu=.5\), by the Law of Large Numbers.

If \(\overline{X}\) is the sample mean diameter for a random sample of \(n=16\) rings, where is the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\) centered, and what is the standard deviation of the \(\overline{X}\) distribution? 3. Answer the questions posed in part (a) for a sample size of \(n=64\) rings. 4.

3. The National Health Statistics Reports dated Oct. 22, 2008 stated that for a sample size of 277 18-year-old American males, the sample mean waist circumference was 86.3 cm. A somewhat complicated method was used to _estimate_ various population percentiles, resulting in the following values: 5th 10th 25th 50th 75th 90th 95th 69.6 70.9 75.2 81.3 95.4 107.1 116.4 **a.**: Is it plausible that the waist size distribution is at least approximately normal? Explain your reasoning. If your answer is no, conjecture the shape of the population distribution. **b.**: Suppose that the population mean waist size is 85 cm and that the population standard deviation is 15 cm. How likely is it that a random sample of 277 individuals will result in a sample mean waist size of at least 86.3 cm? 3. Referring back to (b), suppose now that the population mean waist size is 82 cm (closer to the median than the mean). Now what is the (approximate) probability that the sample mean will be at least 86.3? In light of this calculation, do you think that 82 is a reasonable value for \(\mu\)?14.

22. Suppose the distribution of the time \(X\) (in hours) spent by students at a certain university on a particular project is gamma with parameters \(\alpha=50\) and \(\beta=2\).

Use this fact to compute the probability that a randomly selected student spends at most 125 h on the project.
23. The Central Limit Theorem says that \(\overline{X}\) is approximately normal if the sample size is large. More specifically, the theorem states that the standardized \(\overline{X}\) has a limiting standard normal distribution.

### The Mean, Variance, and MGF

for Several Variables

The sample mean \(\overline{X}\) and sample total \(T_{o}\) are special cases of a type of random variable that arises very frequently in statistical applications.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & Given a collection of \(n\) random variables \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) and \(n\) numerical constants \(a_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(a_{n}\), the rv \\ \(Y=a_{1}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}X_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}X_{i}\) \\ \end{tabular}

is called a **linear combination** of the \(X_{i}\)'s.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Taking & \(a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot=a_{n}=1\) & gives & \(Y=X_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot+X_{n}=T_{\text{o}}\), and \(a_{1}=a_{2}=\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot\cdot=a_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\) & yields \(Y=\frac{1}{n}X_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+\frac{1}{n}X_{n}=\frac{1}{n}(X_{1}+\cdot \cdot\cdot+X_{n})=\frac{1}{n}T_{o}=\overline{X}\). Notice that we are not requiring the \(X_{i}\)'s to be independent or identically distributed. All the \(X_{i}\)'s could have different distributions and therefore different mean values and variances. We first consider the expected value and variance of a linear combination.

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) have mean values \(\mu_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\mu_{n}\), respectively, and variances \(\sigma_{1}^{2},\ldots,\sigma_{n}^{2}\), respectively. \\ \end{tabular}

**1.** Whether or not the \(X_{i}\)'s are independent,

\[\begin{split} E(a_{1}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}X_{n})&=a_{1 }E(X_{1})+\cdots+a_{n}E(X_{n})\\ &=a_{1}\mu_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}\mu_{n}\end{split} \tag{6.7}\]

**2.**: If \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) are independent,

\[\begin{split} V(a_{1}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}X_{n})&=a_{1}^{2 }V(X_{1})+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}V(X_{n})\\ &=a_{1}^{2}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n}^{2}\sigma_{n}^{2}\end{split} \tag{6.8}\]

and

\[\sigma_{a_{1}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}X_{n}}=\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\cdots+a_{n }^{2}\sigma_{n}^{2}} \tag{6.9}\]
**3.**: For any \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\),

\[V(a_{1}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{n}X_{n})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}a_{i}a_{j}\text{ cov}(X_{i},X_{j}) \tag{6.10}\]

Proofs are sketched out later in the section. A paraphrase of (6.7) is that the expected value of a linear combination is the same linear combination of the expected values--for example, \(E(2X_{1}+5X_{2})=2\mu_{1}+5\mu_{2}\). The result (6.8) in Statement 2 is a special case of (6.10) in Statement 3; when the \(X_{i}\)'s are independent, \(\text{Cov}(X_{i},X_{j})=0\) for \(i\neq j\) and \(=V(X_{i})\) for \(i=j\) (this simplification actually occurs when the \(X_{i}\)'s are uncorrelated, a weaker condition than independence). Specializing to the case of a random sample (\(X_{i}\)'s iid) with \(a_{i}=1/n\) for every \(i\) gives \(E(\overline{X})=\mu\) and \(V(\overline{X})=\sigma^{2}/n\), as discussed in Section 6.2. A similar comment applies to the rules for \(T_{\text{o}}\)

A gas station sells three grades of gasoline: regular, plus, and premium. These are priced at $3.50, $3.65, and $3.80 per gallon, respectively. Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), and \(X_{3}\) denote the amounts of these grades purchased (gallons) on a particular day. Suppose the \(X_{i}\)'s are independent with \(\mu_{1}=1000\), \(\mu_{2}=500\), \(\mu_{3}=300\), \(\sigma_{1}=100\), \(\sigma_{2}=80\), and \(\sigma_{3}=50\). The revenue from sales is \(Y=3.5X_{1}+3.65X_{2}+3.8X_{3}\), and

\[\begin{split} E(Y)&=3.5\mu_{1}+3.65\mu_{2}+3.8\mu_{ 3}=\$6465\\ V(Y)&=3.5^{2}\sigma_{1}^{2}+3.65^{2}\sigma_{2}^{2}+3.8^{2}\sigma_{3}^{2}=243,864\\ \sigma_{Y}&=\sqrt{243,864}=\$493.83\end{split}\]

The results of the previous proposition allow for a straightforward derivation of the mean and variance of a hypergeometric rv, which were given without proof in Section 3.6. Recall that the distribution is defined in terms of a population with \(N\) items, of which \(M\) are successes and \(N-M\) are failures. A sample of size \(n\) is drawn, of which \(X\) are successes. It is equivalent to view this as random arrangement of all \(N\) items, followed by selection of the first \(n\). Let \(X_{i}\) be 1 if the \(i\)th item is a success and 0 if it is a failure, \(i=1\), \(2\), \(\ldots\), \(N\). Then

\[X=X_{1}+X_{2}+\cdots\ \cdot+X_{n}\]

According to the proposition, we can find the mean and variance of \(X\) if we can find the means, variances, and covariances of the terms in the sum.

By symmetry, all \(N\) of the \(X_{i}\)'s have the same mean and variance, and all of their covariances are the same. Because each \(X_{i}\) is a Bernoulli random variable with success probability \(p=M/N\), \[E(X_{i})=p=\frac{M}{N} V(X_{i})=p(1-p)=\frac{M}{N}\left(1-\frac{M}{N}\right)\] Therefore, \[E(X)=E\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)=np.\] Here is a trick for finding the covariances \(\text{Cov}(X_{i},X_{j})\) for \(i\neq j\), all of which equal \(\text{Cov}(X_{1},X_{2})\). The sum of all \(N\) of the \(X_{i}\)'s is \(M\), which is a constant, so its variance is 0. We can use Statement 3 of the proposition to express the variance in terms of \(N\) identical variances and \(N(N-1)\) identical covariances: \[0 =V(M)=V\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{i}\right)=NV(X_{1})+N(N-1)\text{Cov} (X_{1},X_{2})\] \[=Np(1-p)+N(N-1)\text{Cov}(X_{1},X_{2}).\] Solving this equation for the covariance, \[\text{Cov}(X_{1},X_{2})=\frac{-p(1-p)}{N-1}.\] Thus, using Statement 3 of the proposition with \(n\) identical variances and \(n(n-1)\) identical covariances, \[V(X) =V\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)=nV(X_{1})+n(n-1)\text{Cov}(X_{ 1},X_{2})\] \[=np(1-p)+n(n-1)\frac{-p(1-p)}{N-1}\] \[=np(1-p)\left(1-\frac{n-1}{N-1}\right)\] \[=np(1-p)\left(\frac{N-n}{N-1}\right)\]

### The Difference Between Two Random Variables

An important special case of a linear combination results from taking \(n=2\), \(a_{1}=1\), and \(a_{2}=-1\):

\[Y=a_{1}X_{1}+a_{2}X_{2}=X_{1}-X_{2}\]

We then have the following corollary to the proposition.

\[E(X_{1}-X_{2})=E(X_{1})-E(X_{2})\text{ and, if }X_{1}\text{ and }X_{2}\text{ are independent, }V(X_{1}-X_{2})=V(X_{1})+V(X_{2}).\]The expected value of a difference is the difference of the two expected values, but the variance of a difference between two independent variables is the _sum_, _not_ the difference, of the two variances. There is just as much variability in \(X_{1}\,-\,X_{2}\) as in \(X_{1}\,+\,X_{2}\) [writing \(X_{1}\,-\,X_{2}\,=\,X_{1}\,+\,(-1)X_{2}\), \((-1)X_{2}\) has the same amount of variability as \(X_{2}\) itself].

An automobile manufacturer equips a particular model with either a six-cylinder engine or a four-cylinder engine. Let \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) be fuel efficiencies for independently and randomly selected six-cylinder and four-cylinder cars, respectively. With \(\mu_{1}=22\), \(\mu_{2}=26\), \(\sigma_{1}=1.2\), and \(\sigma_{2}=1.5\),

\[E(X_{1}\,-\,X_{2}) =\mu_{1}\,-\,\mu_{2}=22\,-\,26=-4\] \[V(X_{1}\,-\,X_{2}) =\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}=1.2^{2}+1.5^{2}=3.69\] \[\sigma_{X_{1}\,-\,X_{2}} =\sqrt{3.69}=1.92\]

If we relabel so that \(X_{1}\) refers to the four-cylinder car, then \(E(X_{1}\,-\,X_{2})=4\), but the variance of the difference is still 3.69.

## The Case of Normal Random Variables

When the \(X_{i}\)'s form a random sample from a normal distribution, \(\overline{X}\) and \(T_{\text{o}}\) are both normally distributed. Here is a more general result concerning linear combinations. The proof will be given toward the end of the section.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & \\ PROPOSITION & If \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) are independent, normally distributed rv's (with possibly different means and/or variances), then any linear combination of the \(X_{i}\)'s also has a normal distribution. In particular, the difference \(X_{1}\,-\,X_{2}\) between two independent, normally distributed variables is itself normally distributed. \\ \end{tabular} The total revenue from the sale of the three grades of gasoline on a particular day was \(Y=3.5X_{1}\,+\,3.65X_{2}\,+\,3.8X_{3}\), and we calculated \(\mu_{Y}=6465\) and (assuming independence) \(\sigma_{Y}=493.83\). If the \(X_{i}\)'s are normally distributed, the probability that revenue exceeds 5000 is

\[P(Y{>}5000) =P\left(Z{>}\frac{5000-6465}{493.83}\right)=P(Z{>}-2.967)\] \[=1-\Phi(-2.967)=.9985\]

The CLT can also be generalized so it applies to certain linear combinations. Roughly speaking, if \(n\) is large and no individual term is likely to contribute too much to the overall value, then \(Y\) has approximately a normal distribution.

Proofs for the Case \(n=2\)For the result concerning expected values, suppose that \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are continuous with joint pdf \(f(x_{1},\,x_{2})\). Then

\[E(a_{1}X_{1}+a_{2}X_{2}) =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,(a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2} x_{2})f(x_{1},x_{2})\ dx_{1}\ dx_{2}\] \[=a_{1}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,x_{1}f(x_{1 },x_{2})\ dx_{2}\ dx_{1}+a_{2}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,x _{2}f(x_{1},x_{2})\ dx_{1}\ dx_{2}\] \[=a_{1}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,x_{1}f_{x_{1}}(x_{1})\ dx_{1}+a_{2 }\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\,x_{2}f_{x_{2}}(x_{2})\ dx_{2}\] \[=a_{1}E(X_{1})+a_{2}E(X_{2})\]

Summation replaces integration in the discrete case. The argument for the variance result does not require specifying whether either variable is discrete or continuous. Recalling that \(V(Y)=E[(Y-\mu_{Y})^{2}]\),

\[V(a_{1}X_{1}+a_{2}X_{2}) =E\{[a_{1}X_{1}+a_{2}X_{2}-(a_{1}\mu_{1}+a_{2}\mu_{2})]^{2}\}\] \[=E\{a_{1}^{2}(X_{1}-\mu_{1})^{2}+a_{2}^{2}(X_{2}-\mu_{2})^{2}+2a_ {1}a_{2}(X_{1}-\mu_{1})(X_{2}-\mu_{2})\}\]

The expression inside the braces is a linear combination of the variables \(Y_{1}=(X_{1}-\mu_{1})^{2},Y_{2}=(X_{2}-\mu_{2})^{2}\), and \(Y_{3}=(X_{1}-\mu_{1})(X_{2}-\mu_{2})\), so carrying the \(E\) operation through to the three terms gives \(a_{1}^{2}V(X_{1})+a_{2}^{2}V(X_{2})+2a_{1}a_{2}\text{Cov}(X_{1},X_{2})\) as required. 

The previous proposition has a generalization to the case of two linear combinations:

* Let \(U\) and \(V\) be linear combinations of the independent normal rv's \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\). Then the joint distribution of \(U\) and \(V\) is bivariate normal. The converse is also true: if \(U\) and \(V\) have a bivariate normal distribution then they can be expressed as linear combinations of independent normal rv's.

The proof uses the methods of Section 5.4 together with a little matrix theory.

* How can we create two bivariate normal rv's \(X\) and \(Y\) with a specified correlation \(\rho\)? Let \(Z_{1}\) and \(Z_{2}\) be independent standard normal rv's and let \[X=Z_{1}\qquad Y=\rho\cdot Z_{1}+\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}Z_{2}\] Then \(X\) and \(Y\) are linear combinations of independent normal random variables, so their joint distribution is bivariate normal. Furthermore, they each have standard deviation 1 (verify this for \(Y\)) and their covariance is \(\rho\), so their correlation is \(\rho\). 

## Moment Generating Functions for Linear Combinations

We shall use moment generating functions to prove the proposition on linear combinations of normal random variables, but we first need a general proposition on the distribution of linear combinations. This will be useful for normal random variables and others.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11584]

Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent Poisson random variables, where \(X\) has mean \(\lambda\) and \(Y\) has mean \(v\). We can show that \(X\,+\,Y\) also has the Poisson distribution and its mean is \(\lambda\,+\,v\), with the help of the proposition on the moment generating function of a linear combination. According to the proposition, \[M_{X+Y}(t)=M_{X}(t)\cdot M_{Y}(t)=e^{\lambda(t^{\prime}-1)}e^{v(t^{\prime}-1)}= e^{(\lambda+v)(t^{\prime}-1)}\] Here we have used for both \(X\) and \(Y\) the moment generating function of the Poisson distribution from Section 3.7. The resulting moment generating function for \(X\,+\,Y\) is the moment generating function of a Poisson random variable with mean \(\lambda\,+\,v\). By the uniqueness property of moment generating functions, \(X\,+\,Y\) is Poisson distributed with mean \(\lambda\,+\,v\).

9. Three different roads feed into a particular freeway entrance. Suppose that during a fixed time period, the number of cars coming from each road onto the freeway is a random variable, with expected value and standard deviation as given in the table.

\begin{tabular}{l|r r r}  & Road 1 & Road 2 & Road 3 \\ \hline _Expected value_ & 800 & 1000 & 600 \\ _Standard deviation_ & 16 & 25 & 18 \\ \end{tabular}

* What is the expected total number of cars entering the freeway at this point during the period? [_Hint_: Let \(X_{i}=\) the number from road \(i\).]
* What is the variance of the total number of entering cars? Have you made any assumptions about the relationship between the numbers of cars on the different roads?
* With \(X_{i}\) denoting the number of cars entering from road \(i\) during the period, suppose that Cov(\(X_{1},\ X_{2})=80\), Cov(\(X_{1},\ X_{3})=90\), and Cov(\(X_{2},\ X_{3})=100\) (so that the three streams of traffic are not independent). Compute the expected total number of entering cars and the standard deviation of the total.
* Suppose we take a random sample of size \(n\) from a continuous distribution having median 0 so that the probability of any one observation being positive is.5. We now disregard the signs of the observations, rank them from smallest to largest in absolute value, and then let \(W=\) the sum of the ranks of the observations having positive signs. For example, if the observations are -.3, +.7, +2.1, and -2.5, then the ranks of positive observations are 2 and 3, so \(W=5\). In Chapter 14, \(W\) will be called _Wilcoxon's signed-rank statistic. W_ can be represented as follows: \[W =1\cdot Y_{1}+2\cdot Y_{2}+3\cdot Y_{3}+\cdots+n\cdot Y_{n}\] \[=\sum_{i=1}^{n}i\cdot Y_{i}\] where the \(Y_{i}\)'s are independent Bernoulli rv's, each with \(p=.5\) (\(Y_{i}=1\) corresponds to the observation with rank \(i\) being positive). Compute the following:
* \(E(Y_{i})\) and then \(E(W)\) using the equation for \(W\) [_Hint_: The first \(n\) positive integers sum to \(n(n+1)/2\).]
* \(V(Y_{i})\) and then \(V(W)\) [_Hint_: The sum of the squares of the first \(n\) positive integers is \(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6\).]
* In Exercise 35, the weight of the beam itself contributes to the bending moment. Assume that the beam is of uniform thickness and density so that the resulting load is uniformly distributed on the beam. If the weight of the beam is random, the resulting load from the weight is also random; denote this load by \(W\) (kip-ft).
* If the beam is 12 ft long, \(W\) has mean 1.5 and standard deviation.25, and the fixed loads are as described in part (a) of Exercise 35, what are the expected value and variance of the bending moment? [_Hint_: If the load due to the beam were \(w\)kip-ft, the contribution to the bending moment would be \(w\int_{0}^{12}xdx\).]
* If all three variables (\(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), and \(W\)) are normally distributed, what is the probability that the bending moment will be at most 200kip-ft?
* A professor has three errands to take care of in the Administration Building. Let \(X_{i}=\) the time that it takes for the \(i\)th errand (\(i=1\), 2, 3), and let \(X_{4}=\) the total time in minutes that she spends walking to and from the building and between each errand. Suppose the \(X_{i}\)'s are independent, normally distributed, with the following means and standard deviations: \(\mu_{1}=15\), \(\sigma_{1}=4\), \(\mu_{2}=5\), \(\sigma_{2}=1\), \(\mu_{3}=8\), \(\sigma_{3}=2\), \(\mu_{4}=12\), \(\sigma_{4}=3\). She plans to leave her office at precisely 10:00 a.m. and wishes to post a note on her door that reads, "I will return by \(t\) a.m." What time \(t\) should she write down if she wants the probability of her arriving after \(t\) to be.01?
* For males the expected pulse rate is 70/m and the standard deviation is 10/m. For women the expected pulse rate is 77/m and the standard deviation is 12/m. Let \(\overline{X}=\) the sample average pulse rate for a random sample of 40 men and let \(\overline{Y}=\) the sample average pulse rate for a random sample of 36 women
* What is the approximate distribution of \(\overline{X}\)?
* What is the approximate distribution of \(\overline{X}\)- \(\overline{Y}\)? Justify your answer.
* Calculate (approximately) the probability \(P(-2\leq\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\leq 1)\).
* Calculate (approximately) \(P(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\leq-15)\). If you actually observed \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\leq-15\), would you doubt that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=-7\)? Explain.
* In an area having sandy soil, 50 small trees of a certain type were planted, and another 50 trees were planted in an area having clay soil. Let \(X=\) the number of trees planted in sandy soil that survive 1 year and \(Y=\) the number of trees planted in clay soil that survive 1 year. If the probability that a tree planted in sandy soil will survive 1 year is.7 and the probability of 1-year survival in clay soil is.6, compute \(P(-5 \leq X - Y \leq 5)\) (use an approximation, but do not bother with the continuity correction).
44. Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be independent gamma random variables, both with the same scale parameter \(\beta\). The value of the other parameter is \(\alpha_{1}\) for \(X\) and \(\alpha_{2}\) for \(Y\). Use moment generating functions to show that \(X+Y\) is also gamma distributed with scale parameter \(\beta\), and with the other parameter equal to \(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\). Is \(X+Y\) gamma distributed if the scale parameters are different? Explain.
45. The proof of the Central Limit Theorem requires calculating the moment generating function for the standardized mean from a random sample of any distribution, and showing that it approaches the moment generating function of the standard normal distribution. Here we look at a particular case of the Laplace distribution, for which the calculation is simpler. 1. Letting \(X\) have \(\text{pdf}f(x)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-|x|},-\infty<x<\infty\), show that \(M_{X}(t)=1/(1-t),-1<t<1\). 2. Find the moment generating function \(M_{Y}(t)\) for the standardized mean \(Y\) of a random sample from this distribution. 3. Show that the limit of \(M_{Y}(t)\) is \(e^{t^{2}/2}\), the moment generating function of a standard normal random variable. [_Hint_: Notice that the denominator of \(M_{Y}(t)\) is of the form \((1+a/n)^{n}\) and recall that the limit of this is \(e^{a}\).] 3. 

## 6.4 Distributions Based on a Normal Random Sample

This section is about three distributions that are related to the sample variance \(S^{2}\). The chi-squared, \(t\), and \(F\) distributions all play important roles in statistics. For normal data we need to be able to work with the distribution of the sample variance, which is built from squares, and this will require finding the distribution for sums of squares of normal variables. The chi-squared distribution, defined in Section 4.4 as a special case of the gamma distribution, turns out to be just what is needed. Also, in order to use the sample standard deviation in a measure of precision for the mean \(\overline{X}\), we will need a distribution that combines the square root of a chi-squared variable with a normal variable, and this is the \(t\) distribution. Finally, we will need a distribution to compare two independent sample variances, and for this we will define the \(F\) distribution in terms of the ratio of two independent chi-squared variables.

## The Chi-Squared Distribution

Recall from Section 4.4 that the chi-squared distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution. It has one parameter, \(v\), called the _number of degrees of freedom_ of the distribution. Possible values of \(v\) are 1, 2, 3,... The chi-squared pdf is

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{2(v/2)\Gamma(v/2)}x^{(v/2)-1}e^{-v/2}&x>0\\ 0&x\leq 0\end{cases}\]

We use the notation \(\chi_{v}^{2}\) to indicate a chi-squared variable with \(v\) df (degrees of freedom).

The mean, variance, and moment generating function of a chi-squared rv follow from the fact that the chi-squared distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution with \(\alpha=v/2\) and \(\beta=2\):

\[\mu=\alpha\beta=v\qquad\sigma^{2}=\alpha\beta^{2}=2v\qquad M_{X}(t)=(1-2t)^{-v /2}\]Here is a result that is not at all obvious, a proposition showing that the square of a standard normal variable has the chi-squared distribution.

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & If \(Z\) has a standard normal distribution and \(X=Z^{2}\), then the pdf of \(X\) is \\  & \(f(x)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{2^{1/2}\Gamma(1/2)}x^{(1/2)-1}e^{-x/2}&x>0\\ 0&x\leq 0\end{cases}\) \\  & That is, \(X\) is chi-squared with 1 df, \(X\sim\chi_{1}^{2}\). \\ \end{tabular}

ProofThe proof involves determining the cdf of \(X\) and differentiating to get the pdf. If \(x>0\),

\[\begin{split} P(X\leq x)&=P(Z^{2}\leq x)=P(-\sqrt{x}\leq Z \leq\sqrt{x})=2P(0\leq Z\leq\sqrt{x})\\ &=2\Phi(\sqrt{x})-2\Phi(0)\end{split}\]

where \(\Phi\) is the cdf of the standard normal distribution. Differentiating, and using \(\phi\) for the pdf of the standard normal distribution, we obtain the pdf

\[f(x)=2\phi(\sqrt{x})(.5x^{-5})=2\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-5x}(.5x^{-5})=\frac{1 }{2^{1/2}\Gamma(1/2)}x^{(1/2)-1}e^{-x/2}\]

The last equality makes use of the relationship \(\Gamma(1/2)=\sqrt{\pi}\).

See Example 4.44 for an alternative proof. 

The next proposition tells us what happens when two independent chi-squared rvs are added together.

\begin{tabular}{c} PROPOSITION & If \(X_{1}\sim\chi_{v_{1}}^{2}\), \(X_{2}\sim\chi_{v_{2}}^{2}\), and they are independent, then \(X_{1}+X_{2}\sim\chi_{v_{1}+v_{2}}^{2}\). \\ \end{tabular}

ProofThe proof uses moment generating functions. Recall from Section 6.3 that, if random variables are independent, then the moment generating function of their sum is the product of their moment generating functions. Therefore,

\[M_{X_{1}+X_{2}}(t)=M_{X_{1}}(t)M_{X_{2}}(t)=(1-2t)^{-v_{1}/2}(1-2t)^{-v_{2}/2}= (1-2t)^{-(v_{1}+v_{2})/2}\]

Because the sum has the moment generating function of a chi-squared variable with \(v_{1}+v_{2}\) degrees of freedom, the uniqueness principle implies that the sum has the chi-squared distribution with \(v_{1}+v_{2}\) degrees of freedom. 

By combining the previous two propositions we can see that the sum of two independent standard normal squares is chi-squared with two degrees of freedom, the sum of three independent standard normal squares is chi-squared with three degrees of freedom, and so on.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11590]

Replacing \(x_{i}\)'s by \(X_{i}\)'s results in \(S^{2}\) and \(\hat{\sigma}^{2}\) becoming statistics (and therefore random variables). A simple function of \(\hat{\sigma}^{2}\) is a chi-squared rv. First recall that if \(X\) is normally distributed, then \((X-\mu)/\sigma\) is a standard normal rv. Thus

\[\frac{n\hat{\sigma}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{X_{i}-\mu}{ \sigma}\right)^{2}\]

is the sum of \(n\) independent standard normal squares, so it is \(\chi_{n}^{2}\).

A similar relationship connects the sample variance \(S^{2}\) to the chi-squared distribution. First, compute

\[\sum\left(X_{i}-\mu\right)^{2} =\sum\left[\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)+\left(\overline{X}-\mu \right)\right]^{2}\] \[=\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)^{2}+2(\overline{X}-\mu)\sum \left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)+\sum\left(\overline{X}-\mu\right)^{2}\]

The middle term on the second line vanishes (why?). Dividing through by \(\sigma^{2}\),

\[\sum\left(\frac{X_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}= \sum\left(\frac{X_{i}-\overline{X}}{\sigma}\right)^{2}+\sum \left(\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}= \sum\left(\frac{X_{i}-\overline{X}}{\sigma}\right)^{2}+n\left(\frac{\overline {X}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}.\]

The last term can be written as the square of a standard normal rv, and therefore as a \(\chi_{1}^{2}\) rv.

\[\sum\left(\frac{X_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2} =\sum\left(\frac{X_{i}-\overline{X}}{\sigma}\right)^{2}+n\left( \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\] \[=\sum\left(\frac{X_{i}-\overline{X}}{\sigma}\right)^{2}+\left( \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\right)^{2} \tag{6.11}\]

It is crucial here that the two terms on the right be independent. This is equivalent to saying that \(S^{2}\) and \(\overline{X}\) are independent. Although it is a bit much to show rigorously, one approach is based on the covariances between the sample mean and the deviations from the sample mean. Using the linearity of the covariance operator,

\[\text{Cov}(X_{i}-\overline{X},\overline{X}) =\text{Cov}(X_{i},\overline{X})-\text{Cov}(\overline{X}, \overline{X})\] \[=\text{Cov}(X_{i},\frac{1}{n}\sum X_{i})-V(\overline{X})=\frac{ \sigma^{2}}{n}-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}=0.\]

This shows that \(\overline{X}\) is uncorrelated with all the deviations of the observations from their mean. In general, this does not imply independence, but in the special case of the bivariate normal distribution, being uncorrelated is equivalent to independence. Both \(\overline{X}\) and \(X_{i}-\overline{X}\) are linear combinations of the independent normal observations, so they are bivariate normal, as discussed in Section 5.3. Because the sample variance \(S^{2}\) is composed of the deviations \(X_{i}-\overline{X}\), we have this result.

**Proposition 1**: _If \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) are a random sample from a normal distribution, then \(\overline{X}\) and \(S^{2}\) are independent._To understand this proposition better we can look at the relationship between the sample standard deviation and mean for a large number of samples. In particular, suppose we select sample after sample of size \(n\) from a particular population distribution, calculate \(\bar{x}\) and \(s\) for each one, and then plot the resulting (\(\bar{x}\), \(s\)) pairs. Figure 6.16(a) shows the result for 1000 samples of size \(n=5\) from a standard normal population distribution. The elliptical pattern, with axes parallel to the coordinate axes, suggests no relationship between \(\bar{x}\) and \(s\), that is, independence of the statistics \(\bar{X}\) and \(S\) (equivalently \(\bar{X}\) and \(S^{2}\)). However, this independence fails for data from a nonnormal distribution, and Figure 6.16(b) illustrates what happens for samples of size 5 from an exponential distribution with mean 1. This plot shows a strong relationship between the two statistics, which is what might be expected for data from a highly skewed distribution.

We will use the independence of \(\bar{X}\) and \(S^{2}\) together with the following proposition to show that \(S^{2}\) is proportional to a chi-squared random variable.

If \(X_{3}=X_{1}+X_{2}\), and \(X_{1}\sim\chi_{v_{1}}^{2}\), \(X_{3}\sim\chi_{v_{3}}^{2}\), \(v_{3}>v_{1}\), and \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are independent, then \(X_{2}\sim\chi_{v_{3}-v_{1}}^{2}\).

The proof is similar to that of the proposition involving the sum of independent chi-squared variables, and it is left as an exercise (Exercise 51).

From Equation 6.11

Assuming a random sample from the normal distribution, the term on the left is \(\chi_{n}^{2}\), and the last term is the square of a standard normal variable, so it is \(\chi_{1}^{2}\).

chi-squared variable with \((n-1)\) degrees of freedom, divided by its degrees of freedom. This chi-squared variable is independent of the numerator, so the ratio has the \(t\) distribution with \((n-1)\) degrees of freedom.

It is not hard to obtain the pdf for \(T\).

The pdf of a random variable \(T\) having a \(t\) distribution with \(v\) degrees of freedom is

\[f(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}v}\,\frac{\Gamma[(v+1)/2]}{\Gamma(v/2)}\,\frac{1}{(1+t ^{2}/v)^{(v+1)/2}},\quad-\infty<t<\infty\]

We first find the cdf of \(T\) and then differentiate to obtain the pdf. A \(t\) variable is defined in terms of a standard normal \(Z\) and a chi-squared variable \(X\) with \(v\) degrees of freedom. They are independent, so their joint pdf \(f(x,z)\) is the product of their individual pdfs.

\[P(T\leq t)=P\left(\frac{Z}{\sqrt{X/v}}\leq t\right)=P\left(Z\leq t\sqrt{\frac{X }{v}}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{v\sqrt{x/v}}f(x,z)\ dz\ dx\]

Differentiating with respect to \(t\) using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,

\[f(t)=\frac{d}{dt}P(T\leq t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{d}{dt}\int_{-\infty}^{v \sqrt{x/v}}f(x,z)\ dz\ dx=\int_{0}^{\infty}\sqrt{\frac{x}{v}}f\bigg{(}x,t\sqrt {\frac{x}{v}}\bigg{)}dx\]

Now substitute the joint pdf and integrate

\[f(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\sqrt{\frac{x}{v}}\frac{x^{v/2-1}}{2^{v/2}\Gamma(v/2)}e^ {-x/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\,e^{-r^{2}x/(2v)}dx\]

The integral can be evaluated by writing the integrand in terms of a gamma pdf.

\[f(t) = \frac{\Gamma[(v+1)/2]}{\sqrt{2\pi v}\Gamma(v/2)[1/2+t^{2}/(2v)]^{ [(v+1)/2]}2^{v/2}}\] \[\times\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{t^{2}}{2v}\right)^ {(v+1)/2}\frac{x^{(v+1)/2-1}}{\Gamma[(v+1)/2]}e^{-[1/2+t^{2}/(2v)]x}dx\]

The integral of the gamma pdf is 1, so

\[f(t) = \frac{\Gamma[(v+1)/2]}{\sqrt{2\pi v}\Gamma(v/2)[1/2+t^{2}/(2v)]^{ [(v+1)/2]}2^{v/2}}\] \[= \frac{\Gamma[(v+1)/2]}{\sqrt{\pi v}\Gamma(v/2)}\,\frac{1}{(1+t^{ 2}/v)^{[(v+1)/2]}},\quad-\infty<t<\infty\]The pdf has a maximum at 0 and decreases symmetrically as \(l\!l\) increases. As \(v\) becomes large the \(t\) pdf approaches the standard normal pdf, as shown in Exercise 54. It makes sense that the \(t\) distribution would be close to the standard normal for large \(v\), because \(T=Z/\sqrt{\chi_{v}^{2}/v}\), and \(\chi_{v}^{2}/v\) converges to 1 by the law of large numbers, as shown in Exercise 48.

Figure 17 shows \(t\) density curves for \(v=1\), 5, and 20 along with the standard normal curve. Notice how fat the tails are for 1 df, as compared to the standard normal. However, as the degrees of freedom increase, the \(t\) pdf becomes more like the standard normal. For 20 df there is not much difference.

Integration of the \(t\) pdf is difficult except for low degrees of freedom, so values of upper tail areas are given in Table 7. For example, the value in the column labeled **2** and the row labeled **3.0** is.048, meaning that for two degrees of freedom \(P(T>3.0)=.048\). We write this as \(t_{.048,2}=3.0\), and in general we write \(t_{x,v}=c\) if \(P(T_{v}>c)=\alpha\). A tabulation of these \(t\) critical values (i.e. \(t_{x,v}\)) for frequently used tail areas \(\alpha\) appears in Table 5.

Using \(v=1\) and \(\Gamma(1/2)=\sqrt{\pi}\) in the chi-squared pdf, we obtain the pdf for the \(t\) distribution with one degree of freedom as \(1/[\pi(1+t^{2})]\). It has another name, the Cauchy distribution. This distribution has such fat tails that the mean does not exist (Exercise 55).

The mean and variance of a \(t\) variable can be obtained directly from the pdf, but there is another route, through the definition in terms of independent standard normal and chi-squared variables, \(T=Z/\sqrt{X/v}\). Recall from Section 5.2 that \(E(UV)=E(U)E(V)\) if \(U\) and \(V\) are independent. Thus, \(E(T)=E(Z)\,E(1/\sqrt{X/v})\). Of course, \(E(Z)=0\), so \(E(T)=0\) if the second expected value on the right exists. Let's compute it from a more general expectation, \(E(X^{k})\) for any \(k\) if \(X\) is chi-squared:

\[E(X^{k}) =\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{k}\frac{x^{(v/2)-1}}{2^{v/2}\Gamma(v/2)}e^{- x/2}dx\] \[=\frac{2^{k+v/2}\Gamma(k+v/2)}{2^{v/2}\Gamma(v/2)}\int_{0}^{ \infty}\frac{x^{(k+v/2)-1}}{2^{k+v/2}\Gamma(k+v/2)}\,e^{-x/2}dx\]

Figure 17: Comparison of \(t\) curves to the \(z\) curve

The second integrand is a gamma pdf so its integral is 1 if \(k+v/2>0\), and otherwise the integral does not exist. Therefore,

\[E(X^{k})=\frac{2^{k}\Gamma(k+v/2)}{\Gamma(v/2)} \tag{6.12}\]

if \(k+v/2>0\), and otherwise the expectation does not exist. The requirement \(k+v/2>0\) translates when \(k=-\frac{1}{2}\) [recall that we need the existence of \(E(1/\sqrt{X/v})\)] into \(v>1\). The mean of a \(t\) variable fails to exist if \(v=1\) and the mean is indeed 0 otherwise.

For the variance of \(T\) we need \(E(T^{2})=E(Z^{2})\,E[1/(X/v)]=1\cdot v/E(1/X)\). Using \(k=-1\) in Equation (6.12), we obtain, with the help of \(\Gamma(a+1)=a\Gamma(a)\),

\[E(X^{-1})=\frac{2^{-1}\Gamma(-1+v/2)}{\Gamma(v/2)}=\frac{2^{-1}}{v/2-1}=\frac {1}{v-2}\qquad\text{if }v>2\]

and therefore \(V(T)=v/(v-2)\). For 1 or 2 degrees of freedom the variance does not exist. The variance always exceeds 1, and for large df the variance is close to 1. This is appropriate because any \(t\) curve spreads out more than the \(z\) curve, but for large df the \(t\) curve approaches the \(z\) curve.

### The \(F\) Distribution

Let \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) be independent chi-squared random variables with \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) degrees of freedom, respectively. The \(F\) distribution with \(v_{1}\) numerator degrees of freedom and \(v_{2}\) denominator degrees of freedom is defined to be the distribution of the ratio

\[F=\frac{X_{1}/v_{1}}{X_{2}/v_{2}}, \tag{6.13}\]

Sometimes the degrees of freedom will be indicated with subscripts \(F_{v_{1},v_{2}}\).

Suppose that we have a random sample of \(m\) observations from the normal population \(N(\mu_{1},\sigma_{1}^{2})\) and an independent random sample of \(n\) observations from a second normal population \(N\bigl{(}\mu_{2},\sigma_{2}^{2}\bigr{)}\). Then for the sample variance from the first group we know \((m-1)S_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{1}^{2}\) is \(\chi_{m-1}^{2}\), and similarly for the second group \((n-1)S_{2}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\) is \(\chi_{n-1}^{2}\). Thus, according to Equation (6.13),

\[F_{m-1,n-1}=\frac{\frac{(m-1)S_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{1}^{2}}{\frac{m-1}{(n-1)S_{1}^{ 2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}}}}{\frac{(n-1)S_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n-1}}=\frac{S_{1}^{2 }/\sigma_{1}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}}. \tag{6.14}\]

The \(F\) distribution, via Equation (6.14), will be used in Chapter 10 to compare the variances from two independent groups. Also, for several independent groups, in Chapter 11 we will use the \(F\) distribution to see if the differences among sample means are bigger than would be expected by chance.

What happens to \(F\) if the degrees of freedom are large? Suppose that \(v_{2}\) is large. Then, using the law of large numbers we can see (Exercise 48) that the denominator of Equation (6.13) will be close to 1, and approximately the \(F\) will be just the numerator chi-squared over its degrees of freedom. Similarly, if both \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) are large, then both the numerator and denominator will be close to 1, and the \(F\) ratio therefore will be close to 1.

The pdf of a random variable having an \(F\) distribution is

\[g(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\Gamma[(v_{1}+v_{2})/2]}{\Gamma(v_{1}/2) \Gamma(v_{2}/2)}\left(\frac{v_{1}}{v_{2}}\right)^{v_{1}/2}\cdot\frac{x^{v_{1} /2-1}}{(1+v_{1}x/v_{2})^{(v_{1}+v_{2})/2}}&x>0\\ 0&x\leq 0\end{array}\right.\]

Its derivation (Exercise 60) is similar to the derivation of the \(t\) pdf. Figure 6.18 shows the \(F\) density curves for several choices of \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}=10\). It should be clear by comparison with Figure 6.15 that the numerator degrees of freedom determine a lot about the shapes in Figure 6.18. For example, with \(v_{1}=1\), the pdf is unbounded at \(x=0\), just as in Figure 6.15 with \(v=1\). For \(v_{1}=2\), the pdf is positive at \(x=0\), just as in Figure 6.15 with \(v=2\). For \(v_{1}>2\), the pdf is 0 at \(x=0\), just as in Figure 6.15 with \(v>2\). However, the \(F\) pdf has a fatter tail, especially for low values of \(v_{2}\). This should be evident because the \(F\) pdf does not decrease to 0 exponentially as the chi-squared pdf does.

Except for a few special choices of degrees of freedom, integration of the \(F\) pdf is difficult, so \(F\) critical values (values that capture specified \(F\) distribution tail areas) are given in Table A.8. For example, the value in the column labeled **1** and the row labeled **2** and **.100** is 8.53, meaning that for one numerator degree of freedom and two denominator degrees of freedom \(P(F>8.53)=.100\). We can express this as \(F_{.1,1,2}=8.53\), where \(F_{a,v_{1},v_{2}}=c\) means that \(P(F_{v_{1},v_{2}}>c)=\alpha\).

What about lower tail areas? Since 1/\(F=(X_{2}/v_{2})/(X_{1}/v_{1})\), the reciprocal of an \(F\) variable also has an \(F\) distribution, but with the degrees of freedom reversed, and this can be used to obtain lower tail critical values. For example,.100 = \(P(F_{1,2}>8.53)=P(1/F_{1,2}<1/8.53)=P(F_{2,1}<.117)\). This can be written as \(F_{.9,2,1}=.117\) because \(.9=P(F_{2,1}>.117)\). In general we have

\[F_{p,v_{1},v_{2}}=\frac{1}{F_{1-p,v_{2},v_{1}}}. \tag{6.15}\]

Recalling that \(T=Z/\sqrt{X/v}\), it follows that the square of this \(t\) random variable is an \(F\) random variable with 1 numerator degree of freedom and \(v\) denominator degrees of freedom, \(t_{v}^{2}=F_{1,v}\). We can use this to obtain tail areas. For example,

\[.100=P(F_{1,2}>8.53)=P(T_{2}^{2}>8.53)=P(|T_{2}|>\sqrt{8.53})=2P(T_{2}>2.92),\]

and therefore \(.05=P(T_{2}>2.92)\). We previously determined that \(.048=P(T_{2}>3.0)\), which is very nearly the same statement. In terms of our notation, \(t_{.05,2}=\sqrt{F_{.10,1,2}}\), and we can similarly show that in general \(t_{\alpha,v}=\sqrt{F_{2x,1,v}}\) if \(0<\alpha<.5\).

The mean of the \(F\) distribution can be obtained with the help of Equation (6.12): \(E(F)=v_{2}/(v_{2}-2)\) if \(v_{2}>2\), and it does not exist if \(v_{2}\leq 2\) (Exercise 57).

### Summary of Relationships

Is it clear how the standard normal, chi-squared, \(t\), and \(F\) distributions are related? Starting with a sequence of \(n\) independent standard normal random variables (let's use five, \(Z_{1},Z_{2},\ldots,Z_{5}\), to be specific) can we construct random variables having the other distributions? For example, the chi-squared distribution with \(n\) degrees of freedom is the sum of \(n\) independent standard normal squares, so \(Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+Z_{3}^{2}\) has the chi-squared distribution with 3 degrees of freedom.

Recall that the ratio of a standard normal rv to the square root of an independent chi-squared rv, divided by its df \(v\), has the \(t\) distribution with \(v\) df. This implies that \(Z_{4}\Big{/}\sqrt{\big{(}Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+Z_{3}^{2}\big{)}/3}\) has the \(t\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. Why would it be wrong to use \(Z_{1}\) in place of \(Z_{4}\)?

Building a random variable with the \(F\) distribution requires two independent chi-squared rvs. We already have \(Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{2}^{2}+Z_{3}^{2}\) with 3 df, and similarly we obtain \(Z_{4}^{2}+Z_{5}^{2}\), chi-squared with 2 df. Dividing each chi-square rv by its df and taking the ratio gives an \(F_{2,3}\) random variable, \(\big{[}\big{(}Z_{4}^{2}+Z_{5}^{2}\big{)}/2\big{]}/\big{[}\big{(}Z_{1}^{2}+Z_{ 2}^{2}+Z_{3}^{2}\big{)}/3\big{]}\).

## Supplementary Series (67-81)

1. In cost estimation, the total cost of a project is the sum of component task costs. Each of these costs is a random variable with a probability distribution. It is customary to obtain information about the total cost distribution by adding together characteristics of the individual component cost distributions--this is called the "roll-up" procedure. For example, \(E(X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n})=E(X_{1})+\cdots+E(X_{n})\), so the roll-up procedure is valid for mean cost. Suppose that there are two component tasks and that \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are independent, normally distributed random variables. Is the roll-up procedure valid for the 75th percentile? That is, is the 75th percentile of the distribution of \(X_{1}+X_{2}\) the same as the sum of the 75th percentiles of the two individual distributions? If not, what is the relationship between the percentile of the sum and the sum of percentiles? For what percentiles is the roll-up procedure valid in this case?68. Suppose that for a certain individual, calorie intake at breakfast is a random variable with expected value 500 and standard deviation 50, calorie intake at lunch is random with expected value 900 and standard deviation 100, and calorie intake at dinner is a random variable with expected value 2000 and standard deviation 180. Assuming that intakes at different meals are independent of each other, what is the probability that average calorie intake per day over the next (365-day) year is at most 3500? [_Hint_: Let _Xi_, _Yi_, and _Zi_ denote the three calorie intakes on day \(i\). Then total intake is given by \(\Sigma(X_{i} + Y_{i} + Z_{i})\).]

70. If \(X\)1, \(X\)2,..., _Xn_ are independent rvs, each with the same mean value \(m\) and variance \(s\)2, then we have seen that _E_(_X_1 + \(X\)2 + * + _Xn_) = _n_m and _V_(_X_1 + \(X\)2 + * + _Xn_) = _n_s_2. In some applications, the number of _Xi_'s under consideration is not a fixed number \(n\) but instead a rv \(N\). For example, let \(N\) be the number of components of a certain type brought into a repair shop on a particular day and let _Xi_ represent the repair time for the _i_th component. Then the total repair time is \(S_{N}\) = \(X\)1 + \(X\)2 + * + _X_N_, the sum of a _random_ number of rvs. * Suppose that \(N\) is independent of the _Xi_'s. Obtain an expression for _E_(\(S_{N}\)) in terms of \(m\) and _E_(_N_). _Hint_: [Refer back to the theorem involving the conditional mean and variance in Section 5.3, and let \(Y\) = \(S_{N}\) and \(X\) = \(N\).] * Obtain an expression for _V_(\(S_{N}\)) in terms of \(m\), \(s\)2, _E_(_N_), and _V_(_N_) (again use the hint of (a)) * Customers submit orders for stock purchases at a certain online site according to a Poisson process with a rate of 3/h.

Why should we worry about the validity of the independence assumption here?
74. A large university has 500 single employees who are covered by its dental plan. Suppose the number of claims filed during the next year by such an employee is a Poisson rv with mean value 2.3. Assuming that the number of claims filed by any such employee is independent of the number filed by any other employee, what is the approximate probability that the total number of claims filed is at least 1200?

Suppose also that the time necessary to get from one classroom to the other is a normally distributed rv \(X\)3 with mean 6 min and standard deviation 1 min. What is the probability that the student makes it to the second class before the lecture starts?(Assume independence of \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), and \(X_{3}\), which is reasonable if the student pays no attention to the finishing time of the first class.)

Then \(X_{1}=W+E_{1}\) and \(X_{2}=W+E_{2}\), where \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are the two measurement errors. Suppose that the \(E_{i}\)'s are independent of each other and of \(W\) and that \(V(E_{1})=V(E_{2})=\sigma_{E}^{2}\). **a.** Express \(\rho\), the correlation coefficient between the two measured weights \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\), in terms of \(\sigma_{W}^{2}\), the variance of actual weight, and \(\sigma_{X}^{2}\), the variance of measured weight. **b.** Compute \(\rho\) when \(\sigma_{W}=1\) kg and \(\sigma_{E}=.01\) kg.
78. Let \(A\) denote the percentage of one constituent in a randomly selected rock specimen, and let \(B\) denote the percentage of a second constituent in that same specimen.

79. Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be independent rv's with mean values \(\mu_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\mu_{n}\) and variances \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\sigma_{n}^{2}\). Consider a function \(h(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\), and use it to define a new rv \(Y=h(X_{1},\)\(\ldots\), \(X_{n})\). Under rather general conditions on the \(h\) function, if the \(\sigma_{i}\)'s are all small relative to the corresponding \(\mu_{i}\)'s, it can be shown that \(E(Y)\approx h(\mu_{1},\)\(\ldots\), \(\mu_{n})\) and \[V(Y)\approx\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_{1}}\right)^{2}\cdot\sigma_{1}^ {2}+\cdots+\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x_{n}}\right)^{2}\cdot\sigma_{n}^ {2}\] where each partial derivative is evaluated at (\(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n})=(\mu_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\mu_{n}\)). Suppose three resistors with resistances \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\) are connected in parallel across a battery with voltage \(X_{4}\). Then by Ohm's law, the current is \[Y=X_{4}\left(\frac{1}{X_{1}}+\frac{1}{X_{2}}+\frac{1}{X_{3}}\right)\] Let \(\mu_{1}=10\) ohms, \(\sigma_{1}=1.0\) ohms, \(\mu_{2}=15\) ohms, \(\sigma_{2}=1.0\) ohms, \(\mu_{3}=20\) ohms, \(\sigma_{3}=1.5\) ohms, \(\mu_{4}=120\) V, \(\sigma_{4}=4.0\) V.

## Appendix: Proof of the Central Limit Theorem

First, here is a restatement of the theorem. Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Then, if \(Z\) is a standard normal random variable,

\[\lim_{n\to\infty}P\left(\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}<z\right)=P(Z<z)\]

The theorem says that the distribution of the standardized \(\overline{X}\) approaches the standard normal distribution. Our proof is only for the special case in which the moment generating function exists, which implies also that all its derivatives exist and that they are continuous. We will show that the moment generating function of the standardized \(\overline{X}\) approaches the moment generating function of the standard normal distribution. However, convergence of the moment generating function does not by itself imply the desired convergence of the distribution. This requires a theorem, which we will not prove, showing that convergence of the moment generating function implies the convergence of the distribution.

The standardized \(\overline{X}\) can be written as

\[Y=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{(1/n)[(X_{1}-\mu)/\sigma+(X_{ 2}-\mu)/\sigma+\cdots+(X_{n}-\mu)/\sigma]-0}{1/\sqrt{n}}\]

The mean and standard deviation for the first ratio come from the first proposition of Section 6.2, and the second ratio is algebraically equivalent to the first. It says that, if we define \(W\) to be the standardized \(X\), so \(W_{i}=(X_{i}-\mu)/\sigma\), \(i=1\), \(2\),\(\ldots\), \(n\), then the standardized \(\overline{X}\) can be written as the standardized \(\bar{W}\),

\[Y=\frac{\overline{X}-\bar{\mu}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{\overline{W}-0}{1/\sqrt {n}}.\]

This allows a simplification of the proof because we can work with the simpler variable \(W\), which has mean 0 and variance 1. We need to obtain the moment generating function of

\[Y=\frac{\overline{W}-0}{1/\sqrt{n}}=\sqrt{n}\ \overline{W}=(W_{1}+W_{2}+\cdots+W_{n})/\sqrt{n}\]from the moment generating function \(M(t)\) of \(W\). With the help of the Section 6.3 proposition on moment generating functions of linear combinations of independent random variables, we get \(M_{Y}(t)=M(t/\sqrt{n})^{n}\). We want to show that this converges to the moment generating function of a standard normal random variable, \(M_{Z}(t)=e^{t^{2}/2}\). It is easier to take the logarithm of both sides and show instead that \(\ln[M_{Y}(t)]=n\ln[M(t/\sqrt{n}\,]\to t^{2}/2\). This is equivalent because the logarithm and its inverse are continuous functions.

The limit can be obtained from two applications of L'Hopital's rule if we set \(x=1/\sqrt{n}\), \(\ln[M_{Y}(t)]=n\ln[M(t/\sqrt{n})]=\ln[M(tx)]/x^{2}\). Both the numerator and the denominator approach 0 as \(n\) gets large and \(x\) gets small (recall that \(M(0)=1\) and \(M(t)\) is continuous), so L'Hopital's rule is applicable. Thus, differentiating the numerator and denominator with respect to \(x\),

\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\ln[M(tx)]}{x^{2}}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{M^{\prime}(tx)t/M(tx)}{2x}= \lim_{x\to 0}\frac{M^{\prime}(tx)t}{2xM(tx)}\]

Recall that \(M(0)=1\), \(M^{\prime}(0)=E(W)=0\) and \(M(t)\) and its derivative \(M^{\prime}(t)\) are continuous, so both the numerator and denominator of the limit on the right approach 0. Thus we can use L'Hopital's rule again.

\[\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{M^{\prime}(tx)t}{2xM(tx)}=\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{M^{\prime\prime}(tx)t^{2}}{2M(tx)+2xM^{ \prime}(tx)t}=\frac{1(t^{2})}{2(1)+2(0)(0)t}=t^{2}/2\]

In evaluating the limit we have used the continuity of \(M(t)\) and its derivatives and \(M(0)=1\), \(M^{\prime}(0)=E(W)=0\), \(M^{\prime\prime}(0)=E(W^{2})=1\). We conclude that the mgf converges to the mgf of a standard normal random variable.

## Chapter 6 Point Estimation

### 6.1 Introduction

Given a parameter of interest, such as a population mean \(\mu\) or population proportion \(p\), the objective of point estimation is to use a sample to compute a number that represents in some sense a good guess for the true value of the parameter. The resulting number is called _a point estimate_. In Section 7.1, we present some general concepts of point estimation. In Section 7.2, we describe and illustrate two important methods for obtaining point estimates: the method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood.

Obtaining a point estimate entails calculating the value of a statistic such as the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) or sample standard deviation \(S\). We should therefore be concerned that the chosen statistic contains all the relevant information about the parameter of interest. The idea of no information loss is made precise by the concept of sufficiency, which is developed in Section 7.3. Finally, Section 7.4 further explores the meaning of efficient estimation and properties of maximum likelihood.

## Chapter 7 General Concepts and Criteria

Statistical inference is frequently directed toward drawing some type of conclusion about one or more parameters (population characteristics). To do so requires that an investigator obtain sample data from each of the populations under study. Conclusions can then be based on the computed values of various sample quantities. For example, let \(\mu\) (a parameter) denote the average duration of anesthesia for a short-acting anesthetic. A random sample of \(n=10\) patients might be chosen, and the duration for each one determined, resulting in observed durations \(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{10}\). The sample mean duration \(\bar{x}\) could then be used to draw a conclusion about the value of \(\mu\). Similarly, if \(\sigma^{2}\) is the variance of the duration distribution (population variance, another parameter), the value of the sample variance \(s^{2}\) can be used to infer something about \(\sigma^{2}\).

When discussing general concepts and methods of inference, it is convenient to have a generic symbol for the parameter of interest. We will use the Greek letter \(\theta\) for this purpose. The objective of point estimation is to select a single number, based on sample data, that represents a sensible value for \(\theta\). Suppose, for example, that the parameter of interest is \(\mu\), the true average lifetime of batteries of a certain type. A random sample of \(n=3\) batteries might yield observed lifetimes (hours) \(x_{1}=5.0\), \(x_{2}=6.4\), \(x_{3}=5.9\). The computed value of the sample mean lifetime is \(\bar{x}=5.77\), and it is reasonable to regard 5.77 as a very plausible value of \(\mu\), our "best guess" for the value of \(\mu\) based on the available sample information.

Suppose we want to estimate a parameter of a single population (e.g., \(\mu\) or \(\sigma\)) based on a random sample of size \(n\). Recall from the previous chapter that before data is available, the sample observations must be considered random variables (rv's) \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\). It follows that any function of the \(X_{i}\)'s--that is, any statistic--such as the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) or sample standard deviation \(S\) is also a random variable. The same is true if available data consists of more than one sample. For example, we can represent duration of anesthesia of \(m\) patients on anesthetic A and \(n\) patients on anesthetic B by \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{m}\) and \(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\), respectively. The difference between the two sample mean durations is \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\), the natural statistic for making inferences about \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\), the difference between the population mean durations.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Definition**} & **A point estimate** of a parameter \(\theta\) is a single number that can be regarded as a sensible value for \(\theta\). A point estimate is obtained by selecting a suitable statistic and computing its value from the given sample data. The selected statistic is called the **point estimator** of \(\theta\). \\ \end{tabular}

In the battery example just given, the estimator used to obtain the point estimate of \(\mu\) was \(\overline{X}\), and the point estimate of \(\mu\) was 5.77. If the three observed lifetimes had instead been \(x_{1}=5.6\), \(x_{2}=4.5\), and \(x_{3}=6.1\), use of the estimator \(\overline{X}\) would have resulted in the estimate \(\bar{x}=(5.6+4.5+6.1)/3=5.40\). The symbol \(\hat{\theta}\) ("theta hat") is customarily used to denote both the estimator of \(\theta\) and the point

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:346]

Each one of the estimators (a)-(d) uses a different measure of the center of the sample to estimate \(\mu\). Which of the estimates is closest to the true value? We cannot answer this without knowing the true value. A question that can be answered is, "Which estimator, when used on other samples of \(X_{i}\)'s, will tend to produce estimates closest to the true value?" We will shortly consider this type of question.

Studies have shown that a calorie-restricted diet can prolong life. Of course, controlled studies are much easier to do with lab animals. Here is a random sample of eight lifetimes (days) taken from a population of 106 rats that were fed a restricted diet (from "Tests and Confidence Sets for Comparing Two Mean Residual Life Functions," _Biometrics_, 1988: 103-115)

\[716\quad 1144\quad 1017\quad 1138\quad 389\quad 1221\quad 530\quad 958\]

Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{8}\) denote the lifetimes as random variables, before the observed values are available. We want to estimate the population variance \(\sigma^{2}\). A natural estimator is the sample variance:

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2}=S^{2}=\frac{\sum{(X_{i}-\overline{X})}^{2}}{n-1}=\frac{\sum{X _{i}^{2}-(\sum{X_{i}})^{2}/n}}{n-1}\]

The corresponding estimate is

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2}=s^{2}=\frac{\sum{x_{i}^{2}-(\sum{x_{i}})^{2}/8}}{7}=\frac{6, 991,551-(7113)^{2}/8}{7}=\frac{667,205}{7}=95,315\]

The estimate of \(\sigma\) would then be \(\hat{\sigma}=s=\sqrt{95,315}=309\)

An alternative estimator would result from using divisor \(n\) instead of \(n-1\) (i.e., the average squared deviation):

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\sum{(X_{i}-\overline{X})}^{2}}{n}\qquad\text{ estimate}=\frac{667,205}{8}=83,401\]

We will indicate shortly why many statisticians prefer \(S^{2}\) to the estimator with divisor \(n\).

In the best of all possible worlds, we could find an estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) for which \(\hat{\theta}=\theta\) always. However, \(\hat{\theta}\) is a function of the sample \(X_{i}\)'s, so it is a random variable. For some samples, \(\hat{\theta}\) will yield a value larger than \(\theta\), whereas for other samples \(\hat{\theta}\) will underestimate \(\theta\). If we write

\[\hat{\theta}=\theta+\text{error of estimation}\]

then an accurate estimator would be one resulting in small estimation errors, so that estimated values will be near the true value.

### Mean Squared Error

A popular way to quantify the idea of \(\hat{\theta}\) being close to \(\theta\) is to consider the squared error \(\left(\hat{\theta}-\theta\right)^{2}\). Another possibility is the absolute error \(\left|\hat{\theta}-\theta\right|\), but this is more difficult to work with mathematically. For some samples, \(\hat{\theta}\) will be quite close to \(\theta\) and the resulting squared error will be very small, whereas the squared error will be quite large whenever a sample produces an estimate \(\hat{\theta}\) that is far from the target. An omnibus measure of accuracy is the mean squared error (expected squared error), which entails averaging the squared error over all possible samples and resulting estimates.

### 1.2.2 Definition

A useful result when evaluating mean squared error is a consequence of the following rearrangement of the shortcut for evaluating a variance \(V(Y)\):

\[V(Y)=E\big{(}Y^{2}\big{)}-\left[E(Y)\right]^{2}\quad\Rightarrow\quad E\big{(}Y ^{2}\big{)}=V(Y)+\left[E(Y)\right]^{2}\]

That is, the expected value of the square of \(Y\) is the variance plus the square of the mean value. Letting \(Y=\hat{\theta}-\theta\), the estimation error, the left-hand side is just the mean squared error. The first term on the right-hand side is \(V(\hat{\theta}-\theta)=V(\hat{\theta})\) since \(\theta\) is just a constant. The second term involves \(E(\hat{\theta}-\theta)=E(\hat{\theta})-\theta\), the difference between the expected value of the estimator and the value of the parameter. This difference is called the **bias** of the estimator. Thus

\[\text{MSE}=V(\hat{\theta})+\left[E(\hat{\theta})-\theta\right]^{2}=\text{ variance of estimator }+\left(\text{bias}\right)^{2}\]

Consider once again estimating a population proportion of "successes" \(p\). The natural estimator of \(p\) is the sample proportion of successes \(\hat{p}=X/n\). The number of successes \(X\) in the sample has a binomial distribution with parameters \(n\) and \(p\), so \(E(X)=np\) and \(V(X)=np(1-p)\). The expected value of the estimator is

\[E(\hat{p})=E\bigg{(}\frac{X}{n}\bigg{)}=\frac{1}{n}\,E(X)=\frac{1}{n}\,np=p\]

Thus the bias of \(\hat{p}\) is \(p-p=0\), giving the mean squared error as

\[E[(\hat{p}-p)^{2}]=V(\hat{p})+0^{2}=V\bigg{(}\frac{X}{n}\bigg{)}=\frac{1}{n^{2 }}\,V(X)=\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\]

Now consider the alternative estimator \(\hat{p}=(X+2)/(n+4)\). That is, add two successes and two failures to the sample and then calculate the sample proportion of successes. One intuitive justification for this estimator is that

\[\bigg{|}\frac{X}{n}-.5\bigg{|}=\bigg{|}\frac{X-.5n}{n}\bigg{|}\qquad\bigg{|} \frac{X+2}{n+4}-.5\bigg{|}=\bigg{|}\frac{X-.5n}{n+4}\bigg{|}\]

from which we see that the alternative estimator is always somewhat closer to.5 than is the usual estimator. It seems particularly reasonable to move the estimate toward.5 when the number of successes in the sample is close to 0 or \(n\). For example, if there are no successes at all in the sample, is it sensible to estimate the population proportion of successes as zero, especially if \(n\) is small?The bias of the alternative estimator is \[E\bigg{(}\frac{X+2}{n+4}\bigg{)}-p\;=\;\frac{1}{n+4}\,E(X+2)-p\;=\;\frac{np+2}{n+4 }-p\;=\;\frac{2/n-4p/n}{1+4/n}\] This bias is not zero unless \(p=.5\). However, as \(n\) increases the numerator approaches zero and the denominator approaches \(1\), so the bias approaches zero. The variance of the estimator is \[V\bigg{(}\frac{X+2}{n+4}\bigg{)}\;=\;\frac{1}{(n+4)^{2}}\;V(X+2)\;=\;\frac{V(X) }{(n+4)^{2}}\;=\;\frac{np(1-p)}{(n+4)^{2}}\;=\;\frac{p(1-p)}{n+8+16/n}\] This variance approaches zero as the sample size increases. The mean squared error of the alternative estimator is \[\text{MSE}=\frac{p(1-p)}{n+8+16/n}+\bigg{(}\frac{2/n-4p/n}{1+4/n}\bigg{)}^{2}\] So how does the mean squared error of the usual estimator, the sample proportion, compare to that of the alternative estimator? If one MSE were smaller than the other for all values of \(p\), then we could say that one estimator is always preferred to the other (using MSE as our criterion). But as Figure 7.1 shows, this is not the case at least for the sample sizes \(n=10\) and \(n=100\), and in fact is not true for any other sample size. According to Figure 7.1, the two MSE's are quite different when \(n\) is small. In this case the alternative estimator is better for values of \(p\) near \(.5\) (since it moves the sample proportion toward \(.5\)) but not for extreme values of \(p\). For large \(n\) the two MSE's are quite similar, but again neither dominates the other.

Figure 7.1: Graphs of MSE for the usual and alternative estimators of \(p\)

Seeking an estimator whose mean squared error is smaller than that of every other estimator for all values of the parameter is generally too ambitious a goal. One common approach is to restrict the class of estimators under consideration in some way, and then seek the estimator that is best in that restricted class. A very popular restriction is to impose the condition of unbiasedness.

### Unbiased Estimators

Suppose we have two measuring instruments; one instrument has been accurately calibrated, but the other systematically gives readings smaller than the true value being measured. When each instrument is used repeatedly on the same object, because of measurement error, the observed measurements will not be identical. However, the measurements produced by the first instrument will be distributed about the true value in such a way that on average this instrument measures what it purports to measure, so it is called an unbiased instrument. The second instrument yields observations that have a systematic error component or bias.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline DEFINITION & A point estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) is said to be an **unbiased estimator** of \(\theta\) if \(E(\hat{\theta})=\theta\) for every possible value of \(\theta\). If \(\hat{\theta}\) is not unbiased, the difference \(E(\hat{\theta})-\theta\) is called the **bias** of \(\hat{\theta}\). \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} That is, \(\hat{\theta}\) is unbiased if its probability (i.e., sampling) distribution is always "centered" at the true value of the parameter. Suppose \(\hat{\theta}\) is an unbiased estimator; then if \(\theta=100\), the \(\hat{\theta}\) sampling distribution is centered at 100; if \(\theta=27.5\), then the \(\hat{\theta}\) sampling distribution is centered at 27.5, and so on. Figure 2 pictures the distributions of several biased and unbiased estimators. Note that "centered" here means that the expected value, not the median, of the distribution of \(\hat{\theta}\) is equal to \(\theta\).

It may seem as though it is necessary to know the value of \(\theta\) (in which case estimation is unnecessary) to see whether \(\hat{\theta}\) is unbiased. This is usually not the case, however, because unbiasedness is a general property of the estimator's sampling distribution--where it is centered--which is typically not dependent on any particular parameter value. For example, in Example 7.4 we showed that \(E(\hat{p})=p\) when \(\hat{p}\) is the sample proportion of successes. Thus if \(p=.25\), the sampling

Figure 2: The pdf’s of a biased estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\) and an unbiased estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{2}\) for a parameter \(\theta\)

distribution of \(\hat{p}\) is centered at.25 (centered in the sense of mean value), when \(p=.9\) the sampling distribution is centered at.9, and so on. It is not necessary to know the value of \(p\) to know that \(\hat{p}\) is unbiased.

When \(X\) is a binomial rv with parameters \(n\) and \(p\), the sample proportion \(\hat{p}=X/n\) is an unbiased estimator of \(p\).

Suppose that \(X\), the reaction time to a stimulus, has a uniform distribution on the interval from 0 to an unknown upper limit \(\theta\) (so the density function of \(X\) is rectangular in shape with height 1/\(\theta\) for \(0\leq x\leq\theta\)). An investigator wants to estimate \(\theta\) on the basis of a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) of reaction times. Since \(\theta\) is the largest possible time in the entire population of reaction times, consider as a first estimator the largest sample reaction time: \(\hat{\theta}_{b}=\max(X_{1},\ \ldots,\ X_{n})\). If \(n=5\) and \(x_{1}=4.2\), \(x_{2}=1.7\), \(x_{3}=2.4\), \(x_{4}=3.9\), \(x_{5}=1.3\), the point estimate of \(\theta\) is \(\hat{\theta}_{b}=\max(4.2,\ 1.7,\ 2.4,\ 3.9,\ 1.3)=4.2\).

Unbiasedness implies that some samples will yield estimates that exceed \(\theta\) and other samples will yield estimates smaller than \(\theta\) -- otherwise \(\theta\) could not possibly be the center (balance point) of \(\hat{\theta}_{b}\)'s distribution. However, our proposed estimator will never overestimate \(\theta\) (the largest sample value cannot exceed the largest population value) and will underestimate \(\theta\) unless the largest sample value equals \(\theta\). This intuitive argument shows that \(\hat{\theta}_{b}\) is a biased estimator. More precisely, using our earlier results on order statistics, it can be shown (see Exercise 50) that

\[E(\hat{\theta}_{b})=\frac{n}{n+1}\cdot\theta<\theta\qquad\left(\text{since} \,\frac{n}{n+1}{<}1\right)\]

The bias of \(\hat{\theta}_{b}\) is given by \(n\theta\)/(\(n\,+\,1\)) - \(\theta=-\theta\)/(\(n\,+\,1\)), which approaches 0 as \(n\) gets large.

It is easy to modify \(\hat{\theta}_{b}\) to obtain an unbiased estimator of \(\theta\). Consider the estimator

\[\hat{\theta}_{u}=\frac{n+1}{n}\cdot\hat{\theta}_{b}=\frac{n+1}{n}\cdot\max(X_{ 1},\ldots,X_{n})\]

Using this estimator on the data gives the estimate (6/5)(4.2) = 5.04. The fact that (\(n\,+\,1\))/\(n>1\) implies that \(\hat{\theta}_{u}\) will overestimate \(\theta\) for some samples and underestimate it for others. The mean value of this estimator is

\[E(\hat{\theta}_{u}) = E\bigg{[}\frac{n+1}{n}\cdot\max(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\bigg{]}= \frac{n+1}{n}\cdot E[\max(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})]\] \[= \frac{n+1}{n}\cdot\frac{n}{n+1}\theta=\theta\]

If \(\hat{\theta}_{u}\) is used repeatedly on different samples to estimate \(\theta\), some estimates will be too large and others will be too small, but in the long run there will be no systematic tendency to underestimate or overestimate \(\theta\).

Statistical practitioners who buy into the **Principle of Unbiased Estimation** would employ an unbiased estimator in preference to a biased estimator. On this basis, the sample proportion of successes should be preferred to the alternative estimator of \(p\), and the unbiased estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{u}\) should be preferred to the biased estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{b}\) in the uniform distribution scenario of the previous example.

Let's turn now to the problem of estimating \(\sigma^{2}\) based on a random sample \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\). First consider the estimator \(S^{2}=\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}^{2}\right)/(n-1)\), the sample variance as we have defined it. Applying the result \(E(Y^{2})=V(Y)+\left[E(Y)\right]^{2}\) to

\[S^{2}=\frac{1}{n-1}\left[\sum X_{i}^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum X_{i}\right)^{2}}{n}\right]\]

from Section 1.4 gives

\[E(S^{2}) = \frac{1}{n-1}\left\{\sum E(X_{i}^{2})-\frac{1}{n}E\left[\left( \sum X_{i}\right)^{2}\right]\right\}\] \[= \frac{1}{n-1}\left\{\sum\left(\sigma^{2}+\mu^{2}\right)-\frac{1}{ n}\left\{V\left(\sum X_{i}\right)+\left[E\left(\sum X_{i}\right)\right]^{2} \right\}\right\}\] \[= \frac{1}{n-1}\left\{n\sigma^{2}+n\mu^{2}-\frac{1}{n}n\sigma^{2}- \frac{1}{n}(n\mu)^{2}\right\}\] \[= \frac{1}{n-1}\left\{n\sigma^{2}-\sigma^{2}\right\}=\sigma^{2}\]

Thus we have shown that the **sample variance \(S^{2}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\)**.

The estimator that uses divisor \(n\) can be expressed as \((n-1)S^{2}/n\), so

\[E\left[\frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{n}\right]=\frac{n-1}{n}E\left(S^{2}\right)=\frac{n-1} {n}\sigma^{2}\]

This estimator is therefore biased. The bias is \((n-1)\sigma^{2}/n-\sigma^{2}=-\sigma^{2}/n\). Because the bias is negative, the estimator with divisor \(n\) tends to underestimate \(\sigma^{2}\), and this is why the divisor \(n-1\) is preferred by many statisticians (although when \(n\) is large, the bias is small and there is little difference between the two).

This is not quite the whole story, however. Suppose the random sample has come from a normal distribution. Then from Section 6.4, we know that the rv \((n-1)S^{2}/\sigma^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(n-1\) degree of freedom. The mean and variance of a chi-squared variable are df and 2 df, respectively. Let's now consider estimators of the form

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2}=c\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)^{2}\]

The expected value of the estimator is

\[E\left[c\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)^{2}\right]=c(n-1)E(S^{2})=c(n-1) \sigma^{2}\]

so the bias is \(c(n-1)\sigma^{2}-\sigma^{2}\). The only unbiased estimator of this type is the sample variance, with \(c=1/(n-1)\).

Similarly, the variance of the estimator is

\[V\Big{[}c\sum(X_{i}-\overline{X})^{2}\Big{]}\quad=\quad V\Bigg{[}c\sigma^{2}\ \frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}\Bigg{]}\quad=\quad c^{2}\sigma^{4}[2(n-1)]\]

Substituting these expressions into the relationship \(MSE=\) variance + (bias)2, the value of \(c\) for which \(MSE\) is minimized can be found by taking the derivative with respect to \(c\), equating the resulting expression to zero, and solving for \(c\). The result is \(c=1/(n+1)\). So in this situation, the principle of unbiasedness and the principle of minimum \(MSE\) are at loggerheads.

As a final blow, even though \(S^{2}\) is unbiased for estimating \(\sigma^{2}\), _it is not true_ that the sample standard deviation \(S\) is unbiased for estimating \(\sigma\). This is because the square root function is not linear, so the expected value of the square root is not the square root of the expected value. Well, if \(S\) is biased, why not find an unbiased estimator for \(\sigma\) and use it rather than \(S\)? Unfortunately there is no estimator of \(\sigma\) that is unbiased irrespective of the nature of the population distribution (although in special cases, e.g., a normal distribution, an unbiased estimator does exist). Fortunately the bias of \(S\) is not serious unless \(n\) is quite small. So we shall generally employ it as an estimator. 

In Example 7.2, we proposed several different estimators for the mean \(\mu\) of a normal distribution. If there were a unique unbiased estimator for \(\mu\), the estimation dilemma could be resolved by using that estimator. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

If \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) is a random sample from a distribution with mean \(\mu\), then \(\overline{X}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\mu\). If in addition the distribution is continuous and symmetric, then \(\widetilde{X}\) and any trimmed mean are also unbiased estimators of \(\mu\).

The fact that \(\overline{X}\) is unbiased is just a restatement of one of our rules of expected value: \(E(\overline{X})=\mu\) for every possible value of \(\mu\) (for discrete as well as continuous distributions). The unbiasedness of the other estimators is more difficult to verify; the argument requires invoking results on distributions of order statistics from Section 5.5.

According to this proposition, the principle of unbiasedness by itself does not always allow us to select a single estimator. When the underlying population is normal, even the third estimator in Example 7.2 is unbiased, and there are many other unbiased estimators. What we now need is a way of selecting among unbiased estimators.

## Estimators with Minimum Variance

Suppose \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\) and \(\hat{\theta}_{2}\) are two estimators of \(\theta\) that are both unbiased. Then, although the distribution of each estimator is centered at the true value of \(\theta\), the spreads of the distributions about the true value may be different.

Figure 7.3 pictures the pdf's of two unbiased estimators, with the first \(\hat{\theta}\) having smaller variance than the second estimator. Then the first \(\hat{\theta}\) is more likely than the second one to produce an estimate close to the true \(\theta\). The MVUE is, in a certain sense, the most likely among all unbiased estimators to produce an estimate close to the true \(\theta\).

We argued in Example 7.5 that when \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\) is a random sample from a uniform distribution on \([0,\,\theta]\), the estimator

\[\hat{\theta}_{1}=\frac{n+1}{n}\cdot\max(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\]

is unbiased for \(\theta\) (we previously denoted this estimator by \(\hat{\theta}_{u}\)). This is not the only unbiased estimator of \(\theta\). The expected value of a uniformly distributed rv is just the midpoint of the interval of positive density, so \(E(X_{i})=\theta/2\). This implies that \(E(\overline{X})=\theta/2\), from which \(E(2\overline{X})=\theta\). That is, the estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{2}=2\overline{X}\) is unbiased for \(\theta\).

If \(X\) is uniformly distributed on the interval \([A,B]\), then \(V(X)=\sigma^{2}=(B-A)^{2}/12\) (Exercise 23 in Chapter 4). Thus, in our situation, \(V(X_{i})=\theta^{2}/12,\,\,V(\overline{X})=\sigma^{2}/n=\theta^{2}/(12n)\), and \(V(\hat{\theta}_{2})=V(2\overline{X})=4V(\overline{X})=\theta^{2}/(3n)\). The results of Exercise 50 can be used to show that \(V(\hat{\theta}_{1})=\theta^{2}/[n(n+2)]\). The estimator \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\) has smaller variance than does \(\hat{\theta}_{2}\) if \(3n<n(n+2)\)--that is, if \(0<n^{2}-n=n(n-1)\). As long as \(n>1\), \(V(\hat{\theta}_{1})<V(\hat{\theta}_{2})\), so \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\) is a better estimator than \(\hat{\theta}_{2}\). More advanced methods can be used to show that \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\) is the MVUE of \(\theta\)--every other unbiased estimator of \(\theta\) has variance that exceeds \(\theta^{2}/[n(n+2)]\).

One of the triumphs of mathematical statistics has been the development of methodology for identifying the MVUE in a wide variety of situations. The most important result of this type for our purposes concerns estimating the mean \(\mu\) of a normal distribution. For a proof in the special case that \(\sigma\) is known, see Exercise 45.

Figure 7.3: Graphs of the pdf’s of two different unbiased estimators

Whenever we are convinced that the population being sampled is normal, the result says that \(\overline{X}\) should be used to estimate \(\mu\). In Example 7.2, then, our estimate would be \(\bar{x}=27.793\).

Once again, in some situations such as the one in Example 7.6, it is possible to obtain an estimator with small bias that would be preferred to the best unbiased estimator. This is illustrated in Figure 7.4. However, MVUEs are often easier to obtain than the type of biased estimator whose distribution is pictured.

## More Complications

The last theorem does not say that in estimating a population mean \(\mu\), the estimator \(\overline{X}\) should be used irrespective of the distribution being sampled.

Suppose we wish to estimate the number of calories \(\theta\) in a certain food. Using standard measurement techniques, we will obtain a random sample \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\) of \(n\) calorie measurements. Let's assume that the population distribution is a member of one of the following three families:

\[f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{-(x-\theta)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}\quad- \infty<x<\infty \tag{7.1}\]

\[f(x)=\frac{1}{\pi[1+(x-\theta)^{2}]}\quad\quad\quad-\infty<x<\infty \tag{7.2}\]

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{aligned} &\frac{1}{2c}&&-c\leq x-\theta\leq c\\ & 0&&\text{otherwise}\end{aligned}\right. \tag{7.3}\]

The pdf (7.1) is the normal distribution, (7.2) is called the Cauchy distribution, and (7.3) is a uniform distribution. All three distributions are symmetric about \(\theta\), which is therefore the median of each distribution. The value \(\theta\) is also the mean for the normal and uniform distributions, but the mean of the Cauchy distribution fails to exist. This happens because, even though the Cauchy distribution is bell-shaped like the normal distribution, it has much heavier tails (more probability far out) than the normal curve. The uniform distribution has no tails. The four estimators for \(\mu\) considered earlier are \(\overline{X},\overline{X},\overline{X}_{\epsilon}\) (the average of the two extreme observations), and \(\overline{X}_{\text{tr}(10)}\), a trimmed mean.

The very important moral here is that the best estimator for \(\mu\) depends crucially on which distribution is being sampled. In particular,

1. If the random sample comes from a normal distribution, then \(\overline{X}\) is the best of the four estimators, since it has minimum variance among all unbiased estimators.

Figure 7.4: A biased estimator that is preferable to the MVUE

2. If the random sample comes from a Cauchy distribution, then \(\overline{X}\) and \(\overline{X}_{e}\) are terrible estimators for \(\mu\), whereas \(\widetilde{X}\) is quite good (the MVUE is not known); \(\overline{X}\) is bad because it is very sensitive to outlying observations, and the heavy tails of the Cauchy distribution make a few such observations likely to appear in any sample. 3. If the underlying distribution is the particular uniform distribution in (7.3), then the best estimator is \(\overline{X}_{e}\); in general, this estimator is greatly influenced by outlying observations, but here the lack of tails makes such observations impossible. 4. _The trimmed mean is best in none of these three situations but works reasonably well in all three_. That is, \(\overline{X}_{r(10)}\) does not suffer too much in comparison with the best procedure in any of the three situations. 

More generally, recent research in statistics has established that when estimating a point of symmetry \(\mu\) of a continuous probability distribution, a trimmed mean with trimming proportion 10% or 20% (from each end of the sample) produces reasonably behaved estimates over a very wide range of possible models. For this reason, a trimmed mean with small trimming percentage is said to be a **robust estimator**.

Until now, we have focused on comparing several estimators based on the same data, such as \(\overline{X}\) and \(\widetilde{X}\) for estimating \(\mu\) when a sample of size \(n\) is selected from a normal population distribution. Sometimes an investigator is faced with a choice between alternative ways of gathering data; the form of an appropriate estimator then may well depend on how the experiment was carried out.

Suppose a type of component has a lifetime distribution that is exponential with parameter \(\lambda\) so that expected lifetime is \(\mu=1/\lambda\). A sample of \(n\) such components is selected, and each is put into operation. If the experiment is continued until all \(n\) lifetimes, \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\), have been observed, then \(\overline{X}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\mu\).

In some experiments, though, the components are left in operation only until the time of the \(r\)th failure, where \(r<n\). This procedure is referred to as **censoring**. Let \(Y_{1}\) denote the time of the first failure (the minimum lifetime among the \(n\) components), \(Y_{2}\) denote the time at which the second failure occurs (the second smallest lifetime), and so on. Since the experiment terminates at time \(Y_{r}\), the total accumulated lifetime at termination is

\[T_{r}=\sum_{i=1}^{r}Y_{i}+(n-r)Y_{r}\]

We now demonstrate that \(\hat{\mu}=T_{r}/r\) is an unbiased estimator for \(\mu\). To do so, we need two properties of exponential variables:

1. The memoryless property (see Section 4.4) says that at any time point, remaining lifetime has the same exponential distribution as original lifetime.
2. If \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{k}\) are independent, each exponentially distributed with parameter \(\lambda\), then min (\(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{k}\)) is exponential with parameter \(k\lambda\) and has expected value \(1/(k\lambda)\). See Example 5.28.

Since all \(n\) components last until \(Y_{1}\), \(n-1\) last an additional \(Y_{2}-Y_{1}\), \(n-2\) an additional \(Y_{3}-Y_{2}\) amount of time, and so on, another expression for \(T_{r}\) is

\[T_{r}=nY_{1}+(n-1)(Y_{2}-Y_{1})+(n-2)(Y_{3}-Y_{2})+\cdots+(n-r+1)(Y_{r}-Y_{r-1})\]

But \(Y_{1}\) is the minimum of \(n\) exponential variables, so \(E(Y_{1})=1/(n\lambda)\). Similarly, \(Y_{2}-Y_{1}\) is the smallest of the \(n-1\) remaining lifetimes, each exponential with parameter \(\lambda\) (by the memoryless property), so \(E(Y_{2}-Y_{1})=1/[(n-1)\lambda]\). Continuing, \(E(Y_{i+1}-Y_{i})=1/[(n-i)\lambda]\), so

\[E(T_{r}) = nE(Y_{1})+(n-1)E(Y_{2}-Y_{1})+\cdots+(n-r+1)E(Y_{r}-Y_{r-1})\] \[= n\cdot\frac{1}{n\lambda}+(n-1)\cdot\frac{1}{(n-1)\lambda}+ \cdots+(n-r+1)\cdot\frac{1}{(n-r+1)\lambda}=\frac{r}{\lambda}\]

Therefore, \(E(T_{r}/r)=(1/r)E(T_{r})=(1/r)\cdot(r/\lambda)=1/\lambda=\mu\) as claimed.

As an example, suppose 20 components are put on test and \(r=10\). Then if the first ten failure times are 11, 15, 29, 33, 35, 40, 47, 55, 58, and 72, the estimate of \(\mu\) is

\[\hat{\mu}=\frac{11+15+\cdots+72+(10)(72)}{10}=111.5\]

The advantage of the experiment with censoring is that it terminates more quickly than the uncensored experiment. However, it can be shown that \(V(T_{r}/r)=1/(\lambda^{2}r)\), which is larger than \(1/(\lambda^{2}n)\), the variance of \(\overline{X}\) in the uncensored experiment.

## Reporting a Point Estimate: The Standard Error

Besides reporting the value of a point estimate, some indication of its precision should be given. The usual measure of precision is the standard error of the estimator used.

The **standard error** of an estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) is its standard deviation \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}=\sqrt{V(\hat{\theta})}\). If the standard error itself involves unknown parameters whose values can be estimated, substitution of these estimates into \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) yields the **estimated standard error** (estimated standard deviation) of the estimator. The estimated standard error can be denoted either by \(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}\) (the \(\hat{\sigma}\) over \(\sigma\) emphasizes that \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) is being estimated) or by \(s_{\hat{\theta}}\).

Assuming that breakdown voltage is normally distributed, \(\hat{\mu}=\overline{X}\) is the best estimator of \(\mu\). If the value of \(\sigma\) is known to be 1.5, the standard error of \(\overline{X}\) is \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}=1.5/\sqrt{20}=.335\). If, as is usually the case, the value of \(\sigma\) is unknown, the estimate \(\hat{\sigma}=s=1.462\) is substituted into \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}\) to obtain the estimated standard error \(\widehat{\sigma}_{\overline{X}}=s_{\overline{X}}=s/\sqrt{n}=1.462/\sqrt{20}=.327\)The standard error of \(\hat{p}=X/n\) is

\[\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{V(X/n)}=\sqrt{\frac{V(X)}{n^{2}}}=\sqrt{\frac{npq}{n^{2}}} =\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}\]

Since \(p\) and \(q=1-p\) are unknown (else why estimate?), we substitute \(\hat{p}=x/n\) and \(\hat{q}=1-x/n\) into \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}\), yielding the estimated standard error \(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}/n}=\sqrt{(.6)(.4)/25}=.098\). Alternatively, since the largest value of \(pq\) is attained when \(p=q=.5\), an upper bound on the standard error is \(\sqrt{1/(4n)}=.10\). 

When the point estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) has approximately a normal distribution, which will often be the case when \(n\) is large, then we can be reasonably confident that the true value of \(\theta\) lies within approximately 2 standard errors (standard deviations) of \(\hat{\theta}\). Thus if measurement of prothrombin (a blood-clotting protein) in 36 individuals gives \(\hat{\mu}=\bar{x}=20.5\) and \(s=3.6\) mg/100 ml, then \(s/\sqrt{n}=.60\), so "within 2 estimated standard errors of \(\hat{\mu}\)" translates to the interval 20.50 \(\pm\) (2)(.60) = (19.30, 21.70).

If \(\hat{\theta}\) is not necessarily approximately normal but is unbiased, then it can be shown (using Chebyshev's inequality, introduced in Exercises 43, 77, and 135 of Chapter 3) that the estimate will deviate from \(\theta\) by as much as 4 standard errors at most 6% of the time. We would then expect the true value to lie within 4 standard errors of \(\hat{\theta}\) (and this is a very conservative statement, since it applies to _any_ unbiased \(\hat{\theta}\)). Summarizing, the standard error tells us roughly within what distance of \(\hat{\theta}\) we can expect the true value of \(\theta\) to lie.

### The Bootstrap

The form of the estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) may be sufficiently complicated so that standard statistical theory cannot be applied to obtain an expression for \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\). This is true, for example, in the case \(\theta=\sigma\), \(\hat{\theta}=S\); the standard deviation of the statistic \(S\), \(\sigma_{S}\), cannot in general be determined. In recent years, a new computer-intensive method called the **bootstrap** has been introduced to address this problem. Suppose that the population pdf is _f_(_x_; \(\theta\)), a member of a particular parametric family, and that data \(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) gives \(\hat{\theta}=21.7\). We now use the computer to obtain "bootstrap samples" from the pdf _f_(_x_; 21.7), and for each sample we calculate a "bootstrap estimate" \(\hat{\theta}^{*}\):

\[\text{First bootstrap sample: }x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{n}^{*};\text{ estimate }=\hat{\theta}_{1}^{*}\]

\[\text{Second bootstrap sample: }x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{n}^{*};\text{ estimate }=\hat{\theta}_{2}^{*}\]

\[B\text{th bootstrap sample: }x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{n}^{*};\text{ estimate }=\hat{\theta}_{B}^{*}\]

\(B=100\) or \(200\) is often used. Now let \(\bar{\theta}^{*}=\sum\hat{\theta}_{i}^{*}/B\), the sample mean of the bootstrap estimates. The **bootstrap estimate** of \(\hat{\theta}\)'s standard error is now just the sample standard deviation of the \(\hat{\theta}_{i}^{*}\)'s:

\[S_{\hat{\theta}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1}\sum\left(\hat{\theta}_{i}^{*}-\bar{ \theta}^{*}\right)^{2}}\]

(In the bootstrap literature, \(B\) is often used in place of \(B-1\); for typical values of \(B\), there is usually little difference between the resulting estimates.)

Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{m}\) be \(m\) independent growth observations on the first type [so \(E(X_{i})=\mu\), \(V(X_{i})=\sigma^{2}\)], and let \(Y_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{n}\) be \(n\) independent growth observations on the second type [\(E(Y_{i})=\mu\), \(V(Y_{i})=4\sigma^{2}\)].

* **Type I:**: Have you violated the honor code (yes or no)?
* **Type II:**: Is the last digit of your telephone number a 0, 1, or 2 (yes or no)?

Each student in the random sample is asked to mix the deck, draw a card, and answer the resulting question truthfully. Because of the irrelevant question on type II cards, a yes response no longer stigmatizes the respondent, so we assume that responses are truthful. Let \(p\) denote the proportion of honor-code violators (i.e., the probability of a randomly selected student being a violator), and let \(\lambda = P(\text{yes}\) response). Then \(\lambda\) and \(p\) are related by \(\lambda =.5p + (.5).(.3)\).

## 72 Methods of Point Estimation

So far the point estimators we have introduced were obtained via intuition and/or educated guesswork. We now discuss two "constructive" methods for obtaining point estimators: the method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood. By constructive we mean that the general definition of each type of estimator suggests explicitly how to obtain the estimator in any specific problem. Although maximum likelihood estimators are generally preferable to moment estimators because of certain efficiency properties, they often require significantly more computation than do moment estimators. It is sometimes the case that these methods yield unbiased estimators.

### The Method of Moments

The basic idea of this method is to equate certain sample characteristics, such as the mean, to the corresponding population expected values. Then solving these equations for unknown parameter values yields the estimators.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & Let \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\) be a random sample from a pmf or pdf _f_(_x_). For \(k=1,2,3,\ldots,\) \\  & the _k_**th population moment**, or _k_**th moment of the distribution**_f_(_x_), is _E_(_X_k_). \\  & The _k_**th sample moment** is \((1/n)\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}^{k}\). \\ \end{tabular}

Thus the first population moment is _E_(_X_) = \(\mu\) and the first sample moment is \(\sum X_{i}/n=\overline{X}\). The second population and sample moments are _E_(_X_2) and \(\sum X_{i}^{2}/n\), respectively. The population moments will be functions of any unknown parameters \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\ldots\).

Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a distribution with pmf or pdf \(f(x;\)\(\theta_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{m}\)), where \(\theta_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{m}\) are parameters whose values are unknown. Then the **moment estimators**\(\hat{\theta}_{1},\ldots,\hat{\theta}_{m}\) are obtained by equating the first \(m\) sample moments to the corresponding first \(m\) population moments and solving for \(\theta_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{m}\).

If, for example, \(m=2\), \(E(X)\) and \(E(X^{2})\) will be functions of \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\). Setting \(E(X)=(1/n)\sum X_{i}\ \ (=\overline{X})\) and \(E(X^{2})=(1/n)\sum X_{i}^{2}\) gives two equations in \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\). The solution then defines the estimators. For estimating a population mean \(\mu\), the method gives \(\mu=\overline{X}\), so the estimator is the sample mean.

Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) represent a random sample of service times of \(n\) customers at a certain facility, where the underlying distribution is assumed exponential with parameter \(\lambda\). Since there is only one parameter to be estimated, the estimator is obtained by equating \(E(X)\) to \(\overline{X}\). Since \(E(X)=1/\lambda\) for an exponential distribution, this gives \(1/\lambda=\overline{X}\) or \(\lambda=1/\overline{X}\). The moment estimator of \(\lambda\) is then \(\hat{\lambda}=1/\overline{X}\). \(\blacksquare\)

Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a gamma distribution with parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). From Section 4.4, \(E(X)=\alpha\beta\) and \(E(X^{2})=\beta^{2}\Gamma(\alpha+2)/\Gamma(\alpha)=\beta^{2}(\alpha+1)\alpha\). The moment estimators of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are obtained by solving

\[\overline{X}=\alpha\beta\qquad\qquad\frac{1}{n}\sum X_{i}^{2}=\alpha(\alpha+1) \beta^{2}\]

Since \(\alpha(\alpha+1)\beta^{2}=\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}+\alpha\beta^{2}\) and the first equation implies \(\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}=\left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}\), the second equation becomes

\[\frac{1}{n}\sum X_{i}^{2}=\left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}+\alpha\beta^{2}\]

Now dividing each side of this second equation by the corresponding side of the first equation and substituting back gives the estimators

\[\hat{\alpha}= \frac{\left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum X_{i}^{2}- \left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}}\qquad\qquad\hat{\beta}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{\sum X _{i}^{2}-\left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}}{\overline{X}}\]

To illustrate, the survival time data mentioned in Example 4.28 is

\[\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}152&115&109&94&88&137&152&77&160&165\\ 125&40&128&123&136&101&62&153&83&69\end{array}\]

with \(\bar{x}=113.5\) and \((1/20)\sum x_{i}^{2}=14,087.8\). The estimates are

\[\hat{\alpha}=\frac{\left(113.5\right)^{2}}{14,087.8-\left(113.5\right)^{2}}=1 0.7\qquad\qquad\hat{\beta}=\frac{14,087.8-\left(113.5\right)^{2}}{113.5}=10.6\]

These estimates of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) differ from the values suggested by Gross and Clark because they used a different estimation technique.

Let \(X_{1}\), \(.\).., \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a generalized negative binomial distribution with parameters \(r\) and \(p\) (Section 3.6). Since \(E(X)=r(1-p)/p\) and \(V(X)=r(1-p)/p^{2}\), \(E(X^{2})=V(X)+[E(X)]^{2}=r(1-p)\) (\(r-rp+1\))/\(p^{2}\). Equating \(E(X)\) to \(\overline{X}\) and \(E(X^{2})\) to \((1/n)\sum X_{i}^{2}\) eventually gives

\[\hat{p}=\frac{\overline{X}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum X_{i}^{2}-\left(\overline{X} \right)^{2}}\qquad\quad\hat{r}=\frac{\left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}}{\frac{1}{ n}\sum X_{i}^{2}-\left(\overline{X}\right)^{2}-\overline{X}}\]

As an illustration, Reep, Pollard, and Benjamin ("Skill and Chance in Ball Games," J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. A, 1971: 623-629) consider the negative binomial distribution as a model for the number of goals per game scored by National Hockey League teams. The data for 1966-1967 follows (420 games):

\[\begin{array}{l|cccccccccccccccc}\mathit{Goals}&0&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10\\ \hline\mathit{Frequency}&29&71&82&89&65&45&24&7&4&1&3\end{array}\]

Then,

\[\bar{x}=\sum x_{i}/420=[(0)(29)+(1)(71)+\cdots+(10)(3)]/420=2.98\]

and

\[\sum x_{i}^{2}/420=[(0)^{2}(29)+(1)^{2}(71)+\cdots+(10)^{2}(3)]/420=12.40\]

Thus,

\[\hat{p}=\frac{2.98}{12.40-\left(2.98\right)^{2}}=.85\qquad\quad\hat{r}=\frac{ \left(2.98\right)^{2}}{12.40-\left(2.98\right)^{2}-2.98}=16.5\]

Although \(r\) by definition must be positive, the denominator of \(\hat{r}\) could be negative, indicating that the negative binomial distribution is not appropriate (or that the moment estimator is flawed). \(\blacksquare\)

## Maximum Likelihood Estimation

The method of maximum likelihood was first introduced by R. A. Fisher, a geneticist and statistician, in the 1920s. Most statisticians recommend this method, at least when the sample size is large, since the resulting estimators have certain desirable efficiency properties (see the proposition on large sample behavior toward the end of this section).

A sample of ten new bike helmets manufactured by a company is obtained. Upon testing, it is found that the first, third, and tenth helmets are flawed, whereas the others are not. Let \(p=P(\text{flawed helmet})\) and define \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{10}\) by \(X_{i}=1\) if the \(i\)th helmet is flawed and zero otherwise. Then the observed \(x_{i}\)'s are 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, so the joint pmf of the sample is

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{10};p)=p(1-p)p\cdots\cdot p=p^{3}(1-p)^{7} \tag{7.4}\]We now ask, "For what value of \(p\) is the observed sample most likely to have occurred?" That is, we wish to find the value of \(p\) that maximizes the pmf (7.4) or, equivalently, maximizes the natural log of (7.4).2 Since

Footnote 2: Since \(\ln[g(x)]\) is a monotonic function of \(g(x)\), finding \(x\) to maximize \(\ln[g(x)]\) is equivalent to maximizing \(g(x)\) itself. In statistics, taking the logarithm frequently changes a product to a sum, which is easier to work with.

\[\ln[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{10};p)]=3\ln(p)+7\ln(1-p) \tag{7.5}\]

and this is a differentiable function of \(p\), equating the derivative of (7.5) to zero gives the maximizing value3:

Footnote 3: This conclusion requires checking the second derivative, but the details are omitted.

\[\frac{d}{dp}\ln[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{10};p)]=\frac{3}{p}-\frac{7}{1-p}=0 \Rightarrow p=\frac{3}{10}=\frac{x}{n}\]

where \(x\) is the observed number of successes (flawed helmets). The estimate of \(p\) is now \(\hat{p}=\frac{3}{10}\). It is called the maximum likelihood estimate because for fixed \(x_{1}\),..., \(x_{10}\), it is the parameter value that maximizes the likelihood (joint pmf) of the observed sample. The likelihood and log likelihood are graphed in Figure 7.5. Of course, the maximum on both graphs occurs at the same value, \(p=.3\).

Note that if we had been told only that among the ten helmets there were three that were flawed, Equation (7.4) would be replaced by the binomial pmf \(\left(\begin{array}{c}10\\ 3\end{array}\right)p^{3}(1-p)^{7}\), which is also maximized for \(\hat{p}=\frac{3}{10}\).

Figure 7.5: Likelihood and log likelihood plotted against \(p\)

The likelihood function tells us how likely the observed sample is as a function of the possible parameter values. Maximizing the likelihood gives the parameter values for which the observed sample is most likely to have been generated, that is, the parameter values that "agree most closely" with the observed data.

Suppose \(X\)1,..., _Xn_ is a random sample from an exponential distribution with parameter \(l\). Because of independence, the likelihood function is a product of the individual pdf's:

\[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\lambda)=(\lambda e^{-\lambda x_{1}})\cdot\cdots\cdot( \lambda e^{-\lambda x_{n}})=\lambda^{n}e^{-\lambda\Sigma x_{i}}\]

The ln(likelihood) is

\[\ln[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\lambda)]=n\ln(\lambda)-\lambda\sum x_{i}\]

Equating (_d_/_d_l_)[ln(likelihood)] to zero results in \(n/\lambda-\Sigma x_{i}=0\), or \(\lambda=n/\Sigma x_{i}=1/\bar{x}\). Thus the mle is \(\hat{\lambda}=1/\bar{x}\); it is identical to the method of moments estimator but it is not an unbiased estimator, since \(E(1/\bar{X})\neq 1/E(\overline{X})\). \(\blacksquare\)

Let \(X\)1,..., _Xn_ be a random sample from a normal distribution. The likelihood function is

\[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\mu,\sigma^{2}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{-(x_{1}-\mu)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})} \cdot\ldots\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{-(x_{n}-\mu)^{2}/(2\sigma^{2})}\] \[= \left(\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}\right)^{n/2}e^{-\sum(x_{i}-\mu)^{2 }/(2\sigma^{2})}\]

so

\[\ln[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\mu,\sigma^{2})]=-\frac{n}{2}\ln(2\pi\sigma^{2})-\frac {1}{2\sigma^{2}}\sum(x_{i}-\mu)^{2}\]

To find the maximizing values of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\), we must take the partial derivatives of ln(\(f\)) with respect to \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\), equate them to zero, and solve the resulting two equations. Omitting the details, the resulting mle's are \[\hat{\mu}=\overline{X}\qquad\qquad\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X} \right)^{2}}{n}\]

The mle of \(\sigma^{2}\) is not the unbiased estimator, so two different principles of estimation (unbiasedness and maximum likelihood) yield two different estimators. \(\blacksquare\)

In Chapter 3, we discussed the use of the Poisson distribution for modeling the number of "events" that occur in a two-dimensional region. Assume that when the region \(R\) being sampled has area \(a(R)\), the number \(X\) of events occurring in \(R\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda a(R)\) (where \(\lambda\) is the expected number of events per unit area) and that nonoverlapping regions yield independent \(X\)'s.

Suppose an ecologist selects \(n\) nonoverlapping regions \(R_{1},\ldots,R_{n}\) and counts the number of plants of a certain species found in each region. The joint pmf (likelihood) is then

\[p(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\lambda) = \frac{\left[\lambda\cdot a(R_{1})\right]^{x_{1}}e^{-\lambda\cdot a (R_{1})}}{x_{1}!}\cdot\ldots\cdot\frac{\left[\lambda\cdot a(R_{n})\right]^{x_ {n}}e^{-\lambda\cdot a(R_{n})}}{x_{n}!}\] \[= \frac{\left[a(R_{1})\right]^{x_{1}}\cdot\cdots\cdot\left[a(R_{n} )\right]^{x_{n}}\cdot\lambda^{\sum x_{i}}\cdot e^{-\lambda\Sigma a(R_{i})}}{x_ {1}!\cdot\cdots\cdot x_{n}!}\]

The ln(likelihood) is

\[\ln[p(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\lambda)]=\sum x_{i}\cdot\ln[a(R_{i})]+\ln(\lambda) \cdot\sum x_{i}-\lambda\sum a(R_{i})-\sum\ln(x_{i}!)\]

Taking \(d/d\lambda\) ln(\(p\)) and equating it to zero yields

\[\frac{\sum x_{i}}{\lambda}-\sum a(R_{i})=0\]

so

\[\lambda=\frac{\sum x_{i}}{\sum a(R_{i})}\]

The mle is then \(\hat{\lambda}=\sum X_{i}/\sum a(R_{i})\). This is intuitively reasonable because \(\lambda\) is the true density (plants per unit area), whereas \(\hat{\lambda}\) is the sample density since \(\sum a(R_{i})\) is just the total area sampled. Because \(E(X_{i})=\lambda\cdot a(R_{i})\), the estimator is unbiased.

Sometimes an alternative sampling procedure is used. Instead of fixing regions to be sampled, the ecologist will select \(n\) points in the entire region of interest and let \(y_{i}=\) the distance from the \(i\)th point to the nearest plant. The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of \(Y=\) distance to the nearest plant is

\[F_{Y}(y) = P(Y\leq y)=1-P(Y>y)=1-P\bigg{(}\begin{array}{c}\text{no plants in a}\\ \text{circle of radius $y$}\end{array}\bigg{)}\] \[= 1-\frac{e^{-\lambda\pi y^{2}}\left(\lambda\pi y^{2}\right)^{0}}{ 0!}=1-e^{-\lambda\pi y^{2}}\]

Taking the derivative of \(F_{Y}(y)\) with respect to \(y\) yields

\[f_{Y}(y;\lambda)=\left\{\begin{array}{c}2\pi\lambda ye^{-\lambda\pi y^{2}} \;\;y\geq 0\\ 0\qquad\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

If we now form the likelihood \(f_{Y}(y_{1};\lambda)\cdot\cdots\cdot f_{Y}(y_{n};\lambda)\), differentiate ln(likelihood), and so on, the resulting mle is \[\hat{\lambda}=\frac{n}{\pi\sum Y_{i}^{2}}=\frac{\text{number of plants observed}}{\text{total area sampled}}\]

which is also a sample density. It can be shown that in a sparse environment (small \(\lambda\)), the distance method is in a certain sense better, whereas in a dense environment, the first sampling method is better. 

Let \(X_{1}\), \(\therefore\)\(.\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a Weibull pdf

\[f(x;\alpha,\beta)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{2}}\cdot x^{ \alpha-1}\cdot e^{-(x/\beta)^{x}}&x\geq 0\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Writing the likelihood and \(\ln(\text{likelihood})\), then setting both \((\partial/\partial\alpha)[\ln(f)]=0\) and \((\partial/\partial\beta)[\ln(f)]=0\) yields the equations

\[\alpha=\left[\frac{\sum[x_{i}^{\alpha}\cdot\ln(x_{i})]}{\sum x_{i}^{\alpha}}- \frac{\sum\ln(x_{i})}{n}\right]^{-1}\hskip 30.0pt\beta=\left(\frac{\sum x_{i}^{ \alpha}}{n}\right)^{1/\alpha}\]

These two equations cannot be solved explicitly to give general formulas for the mle's \(\hat{\alpha}\) and \(\hat{\beta}\). Instead, for each sample \(x_{1}\), \(\therefore\)\(.\), \(x_{n}\), the equations must be solved using an iterative numerical procedure. Even moment estimators of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are somewhat complicated (see Exercise 22).

The iterative mle computations can be done on a computer, and they are available in some statistical packages. MINITAB gives maximum likelihood estimates for both the Weibull and the gamma distributions (under "Quality Tools"). Stata has a general procedure that can be used for these and other distributions. For the data of Example 7.14 the maximum likelihood estimates for the Weibull distribution are \(\hat{\alpha}=3.799\) and \(\hat{\beta}=125.88\). (The mle's for the gamma distribution are \(\hat{\alpha}=8.799\) and \(\hat{\beta}=12.893\), a little different from the moment estimates in Example 7.14). Figure 7.6 shows the Weibull log likelihood as a function of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). The surface near the top has a rounded shape, allowing the maximum to be found easily, but for some distributions the surface can be much more irregular, and the maximum may be hard to find.

## Some Properties of MLEs

In Example 7.18, we obtained the mle of \(\sigma^{2}\) when the underlying distribution is normal. The mle of \(\sigma=\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}\), as well as many other mle's, can be easily derived using the following proposition.

\begin{tabular}{l l} PROPOSITION & The Invariance Principle \\  & Let \(\hat{\theta}_{1},\hat{\theta}_{2},\ldots,\hat{\theta}_{m}\) be the mle's of the parameters \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{m}\). Then the mle \\  & of any function \(h(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\ldots\)., \(\theta_{m})\) of these parameters is the function \(h(\hat{\theta}_{1},\hat{\theta}_{2},\ldots,\hat{\theta}_{m})\), of the mle's. \\ \end{tabular}

Proof.: For an intuitive idea of the proof, consider the special case \(m=1\), with \(\theta_{1}=\theta\), and assume that \(h(\cdot)\) is a one-to-one function. On the graph of the likelihood as a function of the parameter \(\theta\), the highest point occurs where \(\theta=\hat{\theta}\). Now consider the graph of the likelihood as a function of \(h(\theta)\). In the new graph the same heights occur, but the height that was previously plotted at \(\theta=a\) is now plotted at \(h(\theta)=h(a)\), and the highest point is now plotted at \(h(\theta)=h(\hat{\theta})\). Thus, the maximum remains the same, but it now occurs at \(h(\hat{\theta})\). 

In the normal case, the mle's of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) are \(\hat{\mu}=\overline{X}\) and \(\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\sum{(X_{i}-\overline{X})}^{2}/n\). To obtain the mle of the function \(h(\mu,\sigma^{2})=\sqrt{\sigma^{2}}=\sigma\), substitute the mle's into the function:

\[\hat{\sigma}=\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^{2}}=\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum{(X_{i}-\overline{X} )}^{2}\right]^{1/2}\]

The mle of \(\sigma\) is not the sample standard deviation \(S\), although they are close unless \(n\) is quite small. Similarly, the mle of the population coefficient of variation \(100\mu/\sigma\) is \(100\hat{\mu}/\hat{\sigma}\). 

The mean value of an rv \(X\) that has a Weibull distribution is

\[\mu=\beta\cdot\Gamma(1+1/\alpha)\]

The mle of \(\mu\) is therefore \(\hat{\mu}=\hat{\beta}\cdot\Gamma(1+1/\hat{\alpha})\), where \(\hat{\alpha}\) and \(\hat{\beta}\) are the mle's of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). In particular, \(\overline{X}\) is not the mle of \(\mu\), although it is an unbiased estimator. At least for large \(n\), \(\hat{\mu}\) is a better estimator than \(\overline{X}\). 

## Large-Sample Behavior of the MLE

Although the principle of maximum likelihood estimation has considerable intuitive appeal, the following proposition provides additional rationale for the use of mle's. (See Section 7.4 for more details.)

\begin{tabular}{l l} PROPOSITION & Under very general conditions on the joint distribution of the sample, when the sample size is large, the maximum likelihood estimator of any parameter \(\theta\) is close to \(\theta\) (consistency), is approximately unbiased [\(E(\hat{\theta})\approx\theta\)], and hasvariance that is nearly as small as can be achieved by any unbiased estimator.

Stated another way, the mle\(\hat{\theta}\) is approximately the MVUE of \(\theta\).

Because of this result and the fact that calculus-based techniques can usually be used to derive the mle's (although often numerical methods, such as Newton's method, are necessary), maximum likelihood estimation is the most widely used estimation technique among statisticians. Many of the estimators used in the remainder of the book are mle's. Obtaining an mle, however, does require that the underlying distribution be specified.

Note that there is no similar result for method of moments estimators. In general, if there is a choice between maximum likelihood and moment estimators, the mle is preferable. For example, the maximum likelihood method applied to estimating gamma distribution parameters tends to give better estimates (closer to the parameter values) than does the method of moments, so the extra computation is worth the price.

### Some Complications

Sometimes calculus cannot be used to obtain mle's.

Suppose the waiting time for a bus is uniformly distributed on [0, \(\theta\)] and the results \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) of a random sample from this distribution have been observed. Since \(f(x;\,\theta)=1/\theta\) for 0 \(\leq x\leq\theta\) and 0 otherwise,

\[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc}1/\theta^{n}&0\leq x_{1 }\leq\theta,\ldots,0\leq x_{n}\leq\theta\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

As long as max(\(x_{i}\)) \(\leq\theta\), the likelihood is 1/\(\theta^{n}\), which is positive, but as soon as \(\theta<\) max(\(x_{i}\)), the likelihood drops to 0. This is illustrated in Figure 7. Calculus will not work because the maximum of the likelihood occurs at a point of discontinuity, but the figure shows that \(\hat{\theta}=\) max(\(x_{i}\)). Thus if my waiting times are 2.3, 3.7, 1.5,.4, and 3.2, then the mle is \(\hat{\theta}=\) 3.7. Note that the mle is biased (see Example 7.5).

A method that is often used to estimate the size of a wildlife population involves performing a capture/recapture experiment. In this experiment, an initial sample of \(M\) animals is captured, each of these animals is tagged, and the animals are then returned to the population. After allowing enough time for the tagged individuals to mix into the population, another sample of size \(n\) is captured. With \(X=\) the number of tagged animals in the second sample, the objective is to use the observed \(x\) to estimate the population size \(N\).

Figure 7.7: The likelihood function for Example 7.23

The parameter of interest is \(\theta=N\), which can assume only integer values, so even after determining the likelihood function (pmf of \(X\) here), using calculus to obtain \(N\) would present difficulties. If we think of a success as a previously tagged animal being recaptured, then sampling is without replacement from a population containing \(M\) successes and \(N-M\) failures, so that \(X\) is a hypergeometric rv and the likelihood function is \[p(x;N)=h(x;n,M,N)=\frac{\left(M\atop x\right)\cdot\left(N-M\atop n-x\right)}{ \left(N\atop n\right)}\] The integer-valued nature of \(N\) notwithstanding, it would be difficult to take the derivative of \(p(x;N)\). However, let's consider the ratio of \(p(x;N)\) to \(p(x;N-1)\): \[\frac{p(x;N)}{p(x;N-1)}=\frac{(N-M)\cdot(N-n)}{N(N-M-n+x)}\] This ratio is larger than 1 if and only if (iff) \(N<Mn/x\). The value of \(N\) for which \(p(x;N)\) is maximized is therefore the largest integer less than \(Mn/x\). If we use standard mathematical notation \([r]\) for the largest integer less than or equal to \(r\), the mle of \(N\) is \(\dot{N}=[Mn/x]\). As an illustration, if \(M=200\) fish are taken from a lake and tagged, subsequently \(n=100\) fish are recaptured, and among the 100 there are \(x=11\) tagged fish, then \(\dot{N}=[(200)(100)/11]=[1818.18]=1818\). The estimate is actually rather intuitive; \(x/n\) is the proportion of the recaptured sample that is tagged, whereas \(M/N\) is the proportion of the entire population that is tagged. The estimate is obtained by equating these two proportions (estimating a population proportion by a sample proportion). \(\blacksquare\)

Suppose \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) is a random sample from a pdf \(f(x;\,\theta)\) that is symmetric about \(\theta\), but the investigator is unsure of the form of the \(f\) function. It is then desirable to use an estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) that is _robust_, that is, one that performs well for a wide variety of underlying pdf's. One such estimator is a trimmed mean. In recent years, statisticians have proposed another type of estimator, called an \(M\)_-estimator_, based on a generalization of maximum likelihood estimation. Instead of maximizing the log likelihood \(\Sigma\ln[f(x;\,\theta)]\) for a specified \(f\), one seeks to maximize \(\Sigma p(x_{i};\,\theta)\). The "objective function" \(\rho\) is selected to yield an estimator with good robustness properties. The book by David Hoaglin et al. (see the bibliography) contains a good exposition on this subject.

This relates \(\lambda\) to \(p\), so the former can be estimated once the latter has been.]

## 7.3 Sufficiency

An investigator who wishes to make an inference about some parameter \(\theta\) will base conclusions on the value of one or more statistics - the sample mean \(\overline{X}\), the sample variance \(S^{2}\), the sample range \(Y_{n}-Y_{1}\), and so on. Intuitively, some statistics will contain more information about \(\theta\) than will others. Sufficiency, the topic of this section, will help us decide which functions of the data are most informative for making inferences.

As a first point, we note that a statistic \(T=t(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\) will not be useful for drawing conclusions about \(\theta\) unless the distribution of \(T\) depends on \(\theta\). Consider, for example, a random sample of size \(n=2\) from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), and let \(T=X_{1}-X_{2}\). Then \(T\) has a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \(2\sigma^{2}\), which does not depend on \(\mu\). Thus this statistic cannot be used as a basis for drawing any conclusions about \(\mu\), although it certainly does carry information about the variance \(\sigma^{2}\).

The relevance of this observation to sufficiency is as follows. Suppose an investigator is given the value of some statistic \(T\), and then examines the _conditional distribution of the sample_\(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) given the value of the statistic - for example, the conditional distribution given that \(\overline{X}=28.7\). If this conditional distribution does not depend upon \(\theta\), then it can be concluded that there is no additional information about \(\theta\) in the data over and above what is provided by \(T\). In this sense, for purposes of making inferences about \(\theta\), it is _sufficient_ to know the value of \(T\), which contains all the information in the data relevant to \(\theta\).

An investigation of major defects on new vehicles of a certain type involved selecting a random sample of \(n=3\) vehicles and determining for each one the value of \(X=\) the number of major defects. This resulted in observations \(x_{1}=1\), \(x_{2}=0\), and \(x_{3}=3\). You, as a consulting statistician, have been provided with a description of the experiment, from which it is reasonable to assume that \(X\) has a Poisson distribution, and told only that the total number of defects for the three sampled vehicles was four.

Knowing that \(T=\sum X_{i}=4\), would there be any additional advantage in having the observed values of the individual \(X_{i}\)'s when making an inference about the Poisson parameter \(\lambda\)? Or rather is it the case that the statistic \(T\) contains all relevant information about \(\lambda\) in the data? To address this issue, consider the conditional distribution of \(X_{1},X_{2},X_{3}\) given that \(\sum X_{i}=4\). First of all, there are only a few possible (\(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\)) triples for which \(x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=4\). For example, (0, 4, 0) is a possibility, as are (2, 2, 0) and (1, 0, 3), but not (1, 2, 3) or (5, 0, 2). That is,

\[P(X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},X_{3}=x_{3}|\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}X_{i}=4)=0\qquad \qquad\text{unless }\ x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}=4\]

Now consider the triple (2, 1, 1), which is consistent with \(\sum X_{i}=4\). If we let \(A\) denote the event that \(X_{1}=2\), \(X_{2}=1\), and \(X_{3}=1\) and \(B\) denote the event that \(\sum X_{i}=4\), then the event \(A\) implies the event \(B\) (i.e., \(A\) is contained in \(B\)), so the intersection of the two events is just the smaller event \(A\). Thus

\[P(X_{1}=2,X_{2}=1,X_{3}=1|\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}X_{i}=4) =P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\] \[=\frac{P(X_{1}=2,X_{2}=1,X_{3}=1)}{P(\Sigma X_{i}=4)}\]

A moment generating function argument shows that \(\sum X_{i}\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(3\lambda\). Thus the desired conditional probability is

\[\frac{\frac{e^{-\lambda}\cdot\lambda^{2}}{2!}\cdot\frac{e^{-\lambda}\cdot \lambda^{1}}{1!}\cdot\frac{e^{-\lambda}\cdot\lambda^{1}}{1!}}{\frac{e^{-3 \lambda}\cdot(3\lambda)^{4}}{4!}}=\frac{4!}{3^{4}\cdot 2!}=\frac{4}{27}\]

Similarly,

\[P(X_{1}=1,X_{2}=0,X_{3}=3|\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}X_{i}=4)=\frac{4!}{3^{4}\cdot 3!}=\frac{4}{81}\]

The complete conditional distribution is as follows:

\[P(X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},X_{3}=x_{3}|\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3}X_{i}=4)\]

\[=\begin{cases}\frac{6}{81}&(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(2,2,0),(2,0,2),(0,2,2)\\ \frac{12}{81}&(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(2,1,1),(1,2,1),(1,1,2)\\ \frac{1}{81}&(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(4,0,0),(0,4,0),(0,0,4)\\ \frac{4}{81}&(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(3,1,0),(1,3,0),(3,0,1),(1,0,3),(0,1,3),(0,3,1 )\end{cases}\]

This conditional distribution does not involve \(\lambda\). Thus once the value of the statistic \(\sum X_{i}\) has been provided, there is no additional information about \(\lambda\) in the individual observations.

To put this another way, think of obtaining the data from the experiment in two stages:

1. Observe the value of \(T=X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}\) from a Poisson distribution with parameter \(3\lambda\).
2. Having observed \(T=4\), now obtain the individual \(x_{i}\)'s from the conditional distribution \[P(X_{1}=x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},X_{3}=x_{3}|\sum_{i=1}^{3}X_{i}=4)\]

Since the conditional distribution in step 2 does not involve \(\lambda\), there is no additional information about \(\lambda\) resulting from the second stage of the data generation process. This argument holds more generally for any sample size \(n\) and any value \(t\) other than 4 (e.g., the total number of defects among ten randomly selected vehicles might be \(\sum X_{i}=16\)). Once the value of \(\sum X_{i}\) is known, there is no further information in the data about the Poisson parameter. \(\blacksquare\)

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline DEFINITION & A statistic \(T=t(X_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,.\,,\,X_{n})\) is said to be **sufficient** for making inferences about a parameter \(\theta\) if the joint distribution of \(X_{1},X_{2},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,X_{n}\) given that \(T=t\) does not depend upon \(\theta\) for every possible value \(t\) of the statistic \(T\). \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The notion of sufficiency formalizes the idea that a statistic \(T\) contains all relevant information about \(\theta\). Once the value of \(T\) for the given data is available, it is of no benefit to know anything else about the sample.

### The Factorization Theorem

How can a sufficient statistic be identified? It may seem as though one would have to select a statistic, determine the conditional distribution of the \(X_{i}\)'s given any particular value of the statistic, and keep doing this until hitting payoff by finding one that satisfies the defining condition. This would be terribly time-consuming, and when the \(X_{i}\)'s are continuous there are additional technical difficulties in obtaining the relevant conditional distribution. Fortunately, the next result provides a relatively straightforward way of proceeding.

\begin{tabular}{c c} THE NEYMAN & Let \(f(x_{1},\,x_{2},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,x_{n};\,\theta)\) denote the joint pmf or pdf of \(X_{1},\,X_{2},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,X_{n}\). Then \(T=t(X_{1},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,X_{n})\) is a sufficient statistic for \(\theta\) if and only if the joint pmf or pdf can be represented as a product of two factors in which the first factor involves \(\theta\) and the data only through \(t(x_{1},\,.\,.\,,\,x_{n})\) whereas the second factor involves \(x_{1},\,.\,.\,,\,x_{n}\) but does not depend on \(\theta\): \\ \(f(x_{1},x_{2},\,.\,.\,,\,x_{n};\theta)\quad=\quad g(t(x_{1},\,.\,.\,,x_{n}); \theta)\cdot h(x_{1},\,.\,,\,x_{n})\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Before sketching a proof of this theorem, we consider several examples.

Let's generalize the previous example by considering a random sample \(X_{1},X_{2},\,.\,.\,.\,,\,X_{n}\) from a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda\), for example, the numbers of blemishes on \(n\) independently selected DVD's or the numbers of errors in \(n\) batches of invoices where each batch consists of 200 invoices. The joint pmf of these variables is \[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x_{1}}}{x_{1}!}\cdot\frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_{2}}}{x_{2}!}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x_{n}}}{x_{n}! }=\frac{e^{-n\lambda}\cdot\lambda^{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}}{x_{1}!\cdot x_{2}! \cdots\cdots x_{n}!}\] \[= \left(e^{-n\lambda}\cdot\lambda^{\sum_{i}x_{i}}\right)\left(\frac{ 1}{x_{1}!\cdot x_{2}!\cdot\cdots\cdot x_{n}!}\right)\] The factor inside the first set of parentheses involves the parameter \(\lambda\) and the data only through \(\sum x_{i}\), whereas the factor inside the second set of parentheses involves the data but not \(\lambda\). So we have the desired factorization, and the sufficient statistic is \(T=\sum X_{i}\) as we previously ascertained directly from the definition of sufficiency. \(\blacksquare\)

A sufficient statistic is not unique; any one-to-one function of a sufficient statistic is itself sufficient. In the Poisson example, the sample mean \(\overline{X}=(1/n)\sum X_{i}\) is a one-to-one function of \(\sum X_{i}\) (knowing the value of the sum of the \(n\) observations is equivalent to knowing their mean), so the sample mean is also a sufficient statistic.

Suppose that the waiting time for a bus on a weekday morning is uniformly distributed on the interval from 0 to \(\theta\), and consider a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) of waiting times (i.e., times on \(n\) independently selected mornings). The joint pdf of these times is

\[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}\frac{1}{ \theta}\cdot\frac{1}{\theta}\cdot\cdots\cdot\frac{1}{\theta}=\frac{1}{\theta^{n }}&0\leq x_{1}\leq\theta,\ldots,0\leq x_{n}\leq\theta\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

To obtain the desired factorization, we introduce notation for an indicator function of an event \(A\): \(I(A)=1\) if \((x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})\) lies in \(A\) and \(I(A)=0\) otherwise. Now let

\[A=\{(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}):0\leq x_{1}\leq\theta,0\leq x_{2}\leq\theta,...,0 \leq x_{n}\leq\theta\}\]

That is, \(A\) is the indicator for the event that all \(x_{i}\)'s are between 0 and \(\theta\). But all \(n\) of the \(x_{i}\)'s will be between 0 and \(\theta\) if and only if the smallest of the \(x_{i}\)'s is at least 0 and the largest is at most \(\theta\). Thus

\[I(A)=I(0\leq\min\{x_{1},...,x_{n}\})\cdot I(\max\{x_{1},...,x_{n}\}\leq\theta\})\]

We can now use this indicator function notation to write a one-line expression for the joint pdf:

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)=\left[\frac{1}{\theta^{n}}\cdot I(\max\{x_{ 1},\ldots,x_{n}\}\leq\theta)\right]\cdot I(0\leq\min\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\})\]

The factor inside the square brackets involves \(\theta\) and the \(x_{i}\)'s only through the function \(t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=\max\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\}\). Voila, we have our desired factorization, and the sufficient statistic for the uniform parameter \(\theta\) is \(T=\max\{X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\}\), the largest order statistic. All the information about \(\theta\) in this uniform random sample is contained in the largest of the \(n\) observations. This result is much more difficult to obtain directly from the definition of sufficiency. \(\blacksquare\)

Proof of the Factorization TheoremA general proof when the \(X_{i}\)'s constitute a random sample from a continuous distribution is fraught with technical details that are beyond the level of our text. So we content ourselves with a proof in the discrete case. For the sake of concise notation, denote \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) by \(\mathbf{X}\) and \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) by \(\mathbf{x}\).

Suppose first that \(T=t(\mathbf{x})\) is sufficient, so that \(P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}\mid T=t)\) does not depend upon \(\theta\). Focus on a value \(t\) for which \(t(\mathbf{x})=t\) (e.g., \(\mathbf{x}=3\), \(0\), \(1\), \(t(\mathbf{x})=\sum x_{i}\), so \(t=4\)). The event that \(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}\) is then identical to the event that both \(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}\) and \(T=t\) because the former equality implies the latter one. Thus

\[f(\mathbf{x};\theta) =P(\mathbf{X};\theta)=P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x},T=t;\theta)\] \[=P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}|T=t;\theta)\cdot P(T=t;\theta)=P( \mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}|T=t)\cdot P(T=t;\theta)\]

Since the first factor in this latter product does not involve \(\theta\) and the second one involves the data only through \(t\), we have our desired factorization.

Now let's go the other way: assume a factorization, and show that \(T\) is sufficient, i.e., that the conditional probability that \(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}\) given that \(T=t\) does not involve \(\theta\).

\[P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}|T=t;\theta) =\frac{P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x},T=t;\theta)}{P(T=t;\theta)}\!=\! \frac{P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x},\theta)}{P(T=t;\theta)}\] \[=\frac{g(t;\theta)\cdot h(\mathbf{x})}{\sum\limits_{\mathbf{u}:t (\mathbf{u})=t}\!P(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{u};\theta)}\!=\!\frac{g(t;\theta)\cdot h (\mathbf{x})}{\sum\limits_{\mathbf{u}:t(\mathbf{u})=t}\!g[t(\mathbf{u};\theta )]\cdot h(\mathbf{u})}\!=\!\frac{h(\mathbf{x})}{\sum\limits_{\mathbf{u}:t( \mathbf{u})=t}\!h(\mathbf{u})}\]

Sure enough, this latter ratio does not involve \(\theta\). 

## Jointly Sufficient Statistics

When the joint pmf or pdf of the data involves a single unknown parameter \(\theta\), there is frequently a single statistic (single function of the data) that is sufficient. However, when there are several unknown parameters--for example, the mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\) of a normal distribution, or the shape parameter \(\alpha\) and scale parameter \(\beta\) of a gamma distribution--we must expand our notion of sufficiency.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & Suppose the joint pmf or pdf of the data involves \(k\) unknown parameters \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{k}\). The \(m\) statistics \(T_{1}=t_{1}(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n})\), \(T_{2}=t_{2}(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n})\), \(\ldots\), \(T_{m}=t_{m}(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n})\) are said to be **jointly sufficient** for the parameters if the conditional distribution of the \(X_{i}\)'s given that \(T_{1}=t_{1}\), \(T_{2}=t_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(T_{m}=t_{m}\) does not depend on any of the unknown parameters, and this is true for all possible values \(t_{1}\), \(t_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(t_{m}\) of the statistics. \\ \end{tabular} Consider a random sample of size \(n=3\) from a continuous distribution, and let \(T_{1}\), \(T_{2}\), and \(T_{3}\) be the three order statistics - that is, \(T_{1}=\) the smallest of the three \(X_{i}\)'s, \(T_{2}=\) the second smallest \(X_{i}\), and \(T_{3}=\) the largest \(X_{i}\) (these order statistics were previously denoted by \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), and \(Y_{3}\).). Then for any values \(t_{1}\), \(t_{2}\), and \(t_{3}\) satisfying \(t_{1}<t_{2}<t_{3}\)\[P(X_{1} =x_{1},X_{2}=x_{2},X_{3}=x_{3}|T_{1}=t_{1},T_{2}=t_{2},T_{3}=t_{3})\] \[=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{3!}&x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}=t_{1},t _{2},t_{3};t_{1},t_{3},t_{2};t_{2},t_{1},t_{3};t_{2},t_{3},t_{1};t_{3},t_{1},t_ {2};t_{3},t_{2},t_{1}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

For example, if the three ordered values are 21.4, 23.8, and 26.0, then the conditional probability distribution of the three \(X_{i}\)'s places probability \(\frac{1}{6}\) on each of the 6 permutations of these three numbers (23.8, 21.4, 26.0, and so on). This conditional distribution clearly does not involve any unknown parameters.

Generalizing this argument to a sample of size \(n\), we see that for a random sample from a continuous distribution, the order statistics are jointly sufficient for \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{k}\) regardless of whether \(k=1\) (e.g., the exponential distribution has a single parameter) or 2 (the normal distribution) or even \(k>2\). 

The factorization theorem extends to the case of jointly sufficient statistics: \(T_{1}\), \(T_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(T_{m}\) are jointly sufficient for \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{k}\) if and only if the joint pmf or pdf of the \(X_{i}\)'s can be represented as a product of two factors, where the first involves the \(\theta_{i}\)'s and the data only through \(t_{1}\), \(t_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(t_{m}\) and the second does not involve the \(\theta_{i}\)'s.

Let \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). The joint pdf is

\[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\mu,\sigma^{2}) =\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}e^{-(x_{i}-\mu)^{2 }/(2\sigma^{2})}\] \[=\left[\frac{1}{\sigma^{n}}\cdot e^{-\left(\Sigma x_{i}^{2}-2\mu \Sigma x_{i}+\mu\sigma^{2}\right)/(2\sigma^{2})}\right]\cdot\left(\frac{1}{2 \pi}\right)^{n/2}\]

This factorization shows that the two statistics \(\Sigma X_{i}\) and \(\Sigma X_{i}^{2}\) are jointly sufficient for the two parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\). Since \(\Sigma(X_{i}-\overline{X})^{2}=\Sigma X_{i}^{2}-n(\overline{X})^{2}\) there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two sufficient statistics and the statistics \(\overline{X}\) and \(\Sigma(X_{i}-\overline{X})^{2}\); that is, values of the two original sufficient statistics uniquely determine values of the latter two statistics, and vice-versa. This implies that the latter two statistics are also jointly sufficient, which in turn implies that the sample mean and sample variance (or sample standard deviation) are jointly sufficient statistics. The sample mean and sample variance encapsulate all the information about \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) that is contained in the sample data. 

## Minimal Sufficiency

When \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) constitute a random sample from a normal distribution, the \(n\) order statistics \(Y_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{n}\) are jointly sufficient for \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\), and the sample mean and sample variance are also jointly sufficient. Both the order statistics and the pair \((\overline{X},S^{2})\) reduce the data without any information loss, but the sample mean and variance represent a greater reduction. In general, we would like the greatest possible reduction without information loss. A **minimal** (possibly jointly) **sufficient statistic** is a function of every other sufficient statistic. That is, given the value(s) of any other sufficient statistic(s), the value(s) of the minimal sufficient statistic(s) can be calculated. The minimal sufficient statistic is the sufficient statistic having the smallest dimensionality, and thus represents the greatest possible reduction of the data without any information loss.

A general discussion of minimal sufficiency is beyond the scope of our text. In the case of a normal distribution with values of both \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) unknown, it can be shown that the sample mean and sample variance are jointly minimal sufficient (so the same is true of \(\sum X_{i}\) and \(\sum X_{i}^{2}\)). It is intuitively reasonable that because there are two unknown parameters, there should be a pair of sufficient statistics. It is indeed often the case that the number of the (jointly) sufficient statistic(s) matches the number of unknown parameters. But this is not always true. Consider a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) from the pdf \(f\!(\!x;\theta)=1/[\pi[1+(x-\theta)]^{2}]\) for \(-\infty<x<\infty\), i.e., from a Cauchy distribution with location parameter \(\theta\). The graph of this pdf is bell shaped and centered at \(\theta\), but its tails decrease much more slowly than those of a normal density curve. Because the Cauchy distribution is continuous, the order statistics are jointly sufficient for \(\theta\). It would seem, though, that a single sufficient statistic (one-dimensional) could be found for the single parameter. Unfortunately this is not the case; it can be shown that the order statistics are _minimal_ sufficient! So going beyond the order statistics to any single function of the \(X_{i}\)'s as a point estimator of \(\theta\) entails a loss of information from the original data.

### Improving an Estimator

Because a sufficient statistic contains all the information the data has to offer about the value of \(\theta\), it is reasonable that an estimator of \(\theta\) or any function of \(\theta\) should depend on the data only through the sufficient statistic. A general result due to Rao and Blackwell shows how to start with an unbiased statistic that is not a function of sufficient statistics and create an improved estimator that is sufficient.

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & Suppose that the joint distribution of \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) depends on some unknown parameter \(\theta\) and that \(T\) is sufficient for \(\theta\). Consider estimating \(h(\theta)\), a specified function of \(\theta\). If \(U\) is an unbiased statistic for estimating \(h(\theta)\) that does not involve \(T\), then the estimator \(U^{*}=E(U\mid T)\) is also unbiased for \(h(\theta)\) and has variance no greater than the original unbiased estimator \(U\). \\ \end{tabular}

ProofFirst of all, we must show that \(U^{*}\) is indeed an estimator--that it is a function of the \(X_{i}\)'s which does not depend on \(\theta\). This follows because, given that \(T\) is sufficient, the distribution of \(U\) conditional on \(T\) does not involve \(\theta\), so the expected value calculated from the conditional distribution will of course not involve \(\theta\). The fact that \(U^{*}\) has smaller variance than \(U\) is a consequence of a conditional expectation-conditional variance formula for \(V(U)\) introduced in Section 5.3:

\[V(U)=V[E(U|T)]+E[V(U|T)]=V(U^{*})+E[V(U|T)]\]

Because \(V(U\mid T)\), being a variance, is positive, it follows that \(V(U)\geq V(U^{*})\) as desired.

Suppose that the number of major defects on a randomly selected new vehicle of a certain type has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda\), Consider estimating \(e^{-\lambda}\), the probability that a vehicle has no such defects, based on a random sample of \(n\) vehicles. Let's start with the estimator \(U=I(X_{1}=0)\), the indicator function of the event that the first vehicle in the sample has no defects. That is,

\[U=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1&\quad\text{if }X_{1}=0\\ 0&\quad\text{if }X_{1}>0\end{array}\right.\]

Then

\[E(U)=1\cdot P(X_{1}=0)+0\cdot P(X_{1}>0)=P(X_{1}=0)=e^{-\lambda}\cdot\lambda^{ 0}/0!=e^{-\lambda}\]

Our estimator is therefore unbiased for estimating the probability of no defects. The sufficient statistic here is \(T=\sum X_{i}\), so of course the estimator \(U\) is not a function of \(T\). The improved estimator is \(U^{\ast}=E(U\,|\,\sum X_{i})=P(X_{1}=0\,|\,\sum X_{i})\). Let's consider \(P(X_{1}=0\,|\,\sum X_{i}=t)\) where \(t\) is some non-negative integer. The event that \(X_{1}=0\) and \(\sum X_{i}=t\) is identical to the event that the first vehicle has no defects and the total number of defects on the last \(n{-}1\) vehicles is \(t\). Thus

\[P(X_{1}=0\,|\,\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}=t)=\frac{P\bigg{(}\{X_{1}=0 \}\cap\left\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}=t\right\}\bigg{)}}{P\left[\sum\limits_ {i=1}^{n}X_{i}=t\right]}\] \[=\frac{P\bigg{(}\{X_{1}=0\}\cap\left\{\sum\limits_{i=2}^{n}X_{i}=t \right\}\bigg{)}}{P\left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}=t\right]}\]

A moment generating function argument shows that the sum of all \(n\)\(X_{i}\)'s has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(n\lambda\) and the sum of the last \(n-1\)\(X_{i}\)'s has a Poisson distribution with parameter \((n-1)\lambda\). Furthermore, \(X_{1}\) is independent of the other \(n\,-\,1\)\(X_{i}\)'s so it is independent of their sum, from which

\[P(X_{1}=0\,|\,\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}=t)=\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{0}}{0!}\cdot \frac{e^{-(n-1)\lambda}[(n-1)\lambda]^{t}}{t!}=\frac{n-1}{n}\bigg{)}^{t}\]

The improved unbiased estimator is then \(U^{\ast}=(1{-}1/n)^{T}\). If, for example, there are a total of 15 defects among 10 randomly selected vehicles, then the estimate is \((1-\frac{1}{10})^{15}=.206\). For this sample, \(\hat{\lambda}=\bar{x}=1.5\), so the maximum likelihood estimate of \(e^{-\lambda}\) is \(e^{-1.5}=.223\). Here as in some other situations the principles of unbiasedness and maximum likelihood are in conflict. However, if \(n\) is large, the improved estimate is \((1-1/n)^{t}=[(1-1/n)^{n}]^{\bar{x}}\approx e^{-\bar{x}}\), which is the mle. That is, the unbiased and maximum likelihood estimators are "asymptotically equivalent." 

We have emphasized that in general there will not be a unique sufficient statistic. Suppose there are two different sufficient statistics \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) such that the first one is not a one-to-one function of the second (e.g., we are not considering \(T_{1}=\sum X_{i}\) and \(T_{2}=\overline{X}\)). Then it would be distressing if we started with an unbiased

Information and Efficiency

In this section we introduce the idea of _Fisher information_ and two of its applications. The first application is to find the minimum possible variance for an unbiased estimator. The second application is to show that the maximum likelihood estimator is asymptotically unbiased and normal (that is, for large \(n\) it has expected value approximately \(\theta\) and it has approximately a normal distribution) with the minimum possible variance.

Here the notation _f_(_x_; \(\theta\)) will be used for a probability mass function or a probability density function with unknown parameter \(\theta\). The Fisher information is intended to measure the precision in a single observation. Consider the random variable \(U\) obtained by taking the partial derivative of ln[_f_(_x_;\(\theta\))] with respect to \(\theta\) and then replacing \(x\) by _X_: \(U=\partial\)[ln[_f_(_X_;\(\theta\))]/\(\partial\theta\). For example, if the pdf is \(\theta x^{\theta-1}\) for \(0<x<1\) (\(\theta>0\)), then \(\partial\)[ln(\(\theta x^{\theta-1}\))]/\(\partial\theta=\partial\)[ln(\(\theta\)) + (\(\theta-1\))ln(\(x\))]/\(\partial\theta=1/\theta\) + ln(_x_), so \(U=\) ln(_X_) + 1/\(\theta\).

**Definition** : The **Fisher information _I_(\(\theta\)) in a single observation from a pmf or pdf _f_(_x_;\(\theta\)) is the variance of the random variable \(U=\partial\)[ln[_f_(_X_;\(\theta\))]/\(\partial\theta\) :

\[I(\theta)=V\biggl{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln(f(X;\theta))\biggr{]} \tag{7.7}\]

It may seem strange to differentiate the logarithm of the pmf or pdf, but this is exactly what is often done in maximum likelihood estimation. In what follows we will assume that _f_(_x_; \(\theta\)) is a pmf, but everything that we do will apply also in the continuous case if appropriate assumptions are made. In particular, it is important to assume that the set of possible _x's_ does not depend on the value of the parameter.

When _f_(_x_; \(\theta\)) is a pmf, we know that \(1=\sum_{x}f(x;\theta)\). Therefore, differentiating both sides with respect to \(\theta\) and using the fact that [ln(_f_)]' = _f'ff_, we find that the mean of \(U\) is 0:

\[\begin{array}{rl}0=&\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\sum_{x}f(x;\theta)=\sum_{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}f(x;\theta)\\ =&\sum_{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}[\ln f(x;\theta)]f(x;\theta)=E[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln(f(X;\theta))]=E(U)\end{array} \tag{7.8}\]

This involves interchanging the order of differentiation and summation, which requires certain technical assumptions if the set of possible \(x\) values is infinite. We will omit those assumptions here and elsewhere in this section, but we emphasize that switching differentiation and summation (or integration) is not allowed if the set of possible values depends on \(\theta\). For example, if the summation were from -\(\theta\) to \(\theta\) there would be additional variability, and therefore terms for the limits of summation would be needed.

There is an alternative expression for \(I(\theta)\) that is sometimes easier to compute than the variance in the definition:

\[I(\theta)=-E\bigg{[}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\ln(f(X;\theta))\bigg{]} \tag{7.9}\]

This is a consequence of taking another derivative in (7.8):

\[0 = \sum_{x}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}[\ln f(x;\theta)]f( x;\theta)+\sum_{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}[\ln f(x;\theta)]\frac{\partial}{ \partial\theta}[\ln f(x;\theta)]f(x;\theta) \tag{7.10}\] \[= E\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\left[\ln f(X; \theta)\right\}+E\left\{\bigg{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X;\theta \bigg{]}^{2}\right\}\]

To complete the derivation of (7.9), recall that \(U\) has mean 0, so its variance is

\[I(\theta)=V\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left[\ln f(X;\theta) \right]\bigg{\}}=E\bigg{\{}\bigg{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X; \theta)\bigg{]}^{2}\bigg{\}}=-E\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2 }}\left[\ln f(X;\theta)\right]\bigg{\}}\]

where Equation (7.10) is used in the last step.

Let \(X\) be a Bernoulli rv, so \(f(x;p)=p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x}\), \(x=0\), 1. Then

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\ln(f(X;p))=\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\left[X\ln p +(1-X)\ln(1-p)\right]=\frac{X}{p}-\frac{1-X}{1-p}=\frac{X-p}{p(1-p)} \tag{7.11}\]

This has mean 0, in accord with Equation (7.8), because \(E(X)=p\). Computing the variance of the partial derivative, we get the Fisher information:

\[I(p) = V\bigg{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\ln(f(X;p))\bigg{]}=\frac{V( X-p)}{\left[p(1-p)\right]^{2}}=\frac{V(X)}{\left[p(1-p)\right]^{2}}=\frac{p(1-p)}{ \left[p(1-p)\right]^{2}} \tag{7.12}\] \[= \frac{1}{p(1-p)}\]

The alternative method uses Equation (7.9). Differentiating Equation (7.11) with respect to \(p\) gives

\[\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial p^{2}}\ln(f(X;p))=\frac{-X}{p^{2}}-\frac{1-X}{ \left(1-p\right)^{2}} \tag{7.13}\]

Taking the negative of the expected value in Equation (7.13) gives the information in an observation:

\[I(p)=-E\bigg{[}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial p^{2}}\ln(f(X;p))\bigg{]}=\frac{p }{p^{2}}+\frac{1-p}{\left(1-p\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{\left(1-p \right)}=\frac{1}{p(1-p)} \tag{7.14}\]Both methods yield the answer \(I(p)=1/[p(1-p)]\), which says that the information is the reciprocal of \(V(X)\). It is reasonable that the information is greatest when the variance is smallest. \(\blacksquare\)

### Information in a Random Sample

Now assume a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) from a distribution with pmf or pdf \(f(x;\,\theta)\). Let \(f(X_{1},X_{2},\,\ldots,X_{n};\,\theta)=f(X_{1};\,\theta)\cdot f(X_{2};\,\theta )\cdot\,\cdots\cdot f(X_{n};\,\theta)\) be the likelihood function. The Fisher information \(I_{n}(\theta)\) for the random sample is the variance of the **score function**

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)=\frac{ \partial}{\partial\theta}\ln[f(X_{1};\theta)\cdot f(X_{2};\theta)\cdot\cdots \cdot f(X_{n};\theta)]\]

The log of a product is the sum of the logs, so the score function is a sum:

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}; \theta)= \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{1};\theta)+\frac{\partial }{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{2};\theta)+\cdots\] \[+\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{n};\theta) \tag{7.15}\]

This is a sum of terms for which the mean is zero, by Equation (7.8), and therefore

\[E\bigg{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n};\theta) \bigg{]}=0 \tag{7.16}\]

The right-hand-side of Equation (7.15) is a sum of independent identically distributed random variables, and each has variance \(I(\theta)\). Taking the variance of both sides of Equation (7.15) gives the information \(I_{n}(\theta)\) in the random sample

\[I_{n}(\theta)=V\bigg{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)\bigg{]}=nV\bigg{[}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln f(X_{1}; \theta)\bigg{]}=nI(\theta). \tag{7.17}\]

Therefore, the Fisher information in a random sample is just \(n\) times the information in a single observation. This should make sense intuitively, because it says that twice as many observations yield twice as much information.

Continuing with Example 7.31, let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from the Bernoulli distribution with \(f(x;\,p)=p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x}\), \(x=0\), \(1\). Suppose the purpose is to estimate the proportion \(p\) of drivers who are wearing seat belts. We saw that the information in a single observation is \(I(p)=1/[p(1-p)]\), and therefore the Fisher information in the random sample is \(I_{n}(p)=nI(p)=n/[p(1-p)]\). \(\blacksquare\)

### The Cramer-Rao Inequality

We will use the concept of Fisher information to show that if \(t(X_{1},X_{2},\,\ldots,X_{n})\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\theta\), then its minimum possible variance is the reciprocal of \(I_{n}(\theta)\). Harald Cramer in Sweden and C. R. Rao in India independently derived this inequality during World War II, but R. A. Fisher had some notion of it 20 years previously.

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & Assume a random sample \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) from the distribution with pmf or pdf \\ (CRAMER- & _f_(\(x\); \(\theta\)) such that the set of possible values does not depend on \(\theta\). If the statistic \\ RAO & \(T=t(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n})\) is an unbiased estimator for the parameter \(\theta\), then \\ INEQUALITY) & \(V(T)\geq\frac{1}{V\big{\{}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left[ \ln f(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)\right]\big{\}}}=\frac{1}{nI(\theta)}=\frac{1} {I_{n}(\theta)}\) \\ \end{tabular}

ProofThe basic idea here is to consider the correlation \(\rho\) between \(T\) and the score function, and the desired inequality will result from \(-1\leq\rho\leq 1\). If \(T=t(X_{1},X_{2},\)\(\ldots,X_{n})\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\theta\), then

\[\theta=E(T)=\sum_{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}}t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n} ;\theta)\]

Differentiating this with respect to \(\theta\),

\[1=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\sum_{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}}t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n} )f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)=\sum_{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}}t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}) \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)\]

Multiplying and dividing the last term by the likelihood _f_(\(x_{1},\)\(\ldots,x_{n};\theta\)) gives

\[1=\sum_{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}}t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\frac{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)}{f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)}f(x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n};\theta)\]

which is equivalent to

\[1 = \sum_{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}}t(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\frac{\partial}{ \partial\theta}[\ln f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)]f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)\] \[= E\bigg{\{}t(X_{1},...,X_{n})\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}[ \ln f(X_{1},...,X_{n};\theta)]\bigg{\}}\]

Therefore, because of Equation 7.16, the covariance of \(T\) with the score function is 1:

\[1=\text{Cov}\bigg{\{}T,\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}[\ln f(X_{1},\ldots,X_{ n};\theta)]\bigg{\}} \tag{7.18}\]

Recall from Section 5.2 that the correlation between two rv's \(X\) and \(Y\) is \(\rho_{X,Y}=\text{Cov}(X,Y)/(\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y})\), and that \(-1\leq\rho_{X,Y}\leq 1\). Therefore,

\[\text{Cov}(X,Y)^{2}=\rho_{X,Y}^{2}\sigma_{X}^{2}\sigma_{Y}^{2}\leq\sigma_{X}^ {2}\sigma_{Y}^{2}\]Apply this to Equation 7.18:

\[\begin{split} 1&=\left(\text{Cov}\bigg{\{}T,\frac{\partial}{ \partial\theta}\left[\ln f(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)\right]\bigg{\}}\right)^{2} \\ &\qquad\leq V(T)\cdot V\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \left[\ln f(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)\right]\bigg{\}}\end{split} \tag{7.19}\]

Dividing both sides by the variance of the score function and using the fact that this variance equals \(nl(\theta)\), we obtain the desired result.

Because the variance of \(T\) must be at least \(1/nI(\theta)\), it is natural to call \(T\) an efficient estimator of \(\theta\) if \(V(T)=1/[nl(\theta)]\).

Let \(T\) be an unbiased estimator of \(\theta\). The ratio of the lower bound to the variance of \(T\) is its **efficiency**. Then \(T\) is said to be an **efficient** estimator if \(T\) achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound (the efficiency is 1). An efficient estimator is a minimum variance unbiased (MVUE) estimator, as discussed in Section 7.1.

Continuing with Example 7.32, let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from the Bernoulli distribution, where the purpose is to estimate the proportion \(p\) of drivers who are wearing seat belts. We saw that the information in the sample is \(I_{n}(p)=n/[p(1-p)]\), and therefore the Cramer-Rao lower bound is \(1/I_{n}(p)=p(1-p)/n\). Let \(T(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n})=\hat{p}=\overline{X}=\sum X_{i}/n\). Then \(E(T)=E(\sum X_{i})/n=np/n=p\) so \(T\) is unbiased, and \(V(T)=V(\sum X_{i})/n^{2}=np(1-p)/n^{2}=p(1-p)/n\). Because \(T\) is unbiased and \(V(T)\) is equal to the lower bound, \(T\) has efficiency 1 and therefore it is an efficient estimator.

### Large Sample Properties of the MLE

As discussed in Section 7.2, the maximum likelihood estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) has some nice properties. First of all it is _consistent_, which means that it converges in probability to the parameter \(\theta\) as the sample size increases. A verification of this is beyond the level of this book, but we can use it as a basis for showing that the mle is asymptotically normal with mean \(\theta\) (asymptotic unbiasedness) and variance equal to the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

Given a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) from a distribution with pmf or pdf _f(x; \(\theta\))_, assume that the set of possible \(x\) values does not depend on \(\theta\). Then for large \(n\) the maximum likelihood estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) has approximately a normal distribution with mean \(\theta\) and variance \(1/[nl(\theta)]\). More precisely, the limiting distribution of \(\sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}-\theta)\) is normal with mean 0 and variance \(1/I(\theta)\).

ProofConsider the score function

\[S(\theta)=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln\!f(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)\]

Its derivative \(S^{\prime}\)(\(\theta\)) at the true \(\theta\) is approximately equal to the difference quotient

\[S^{\prime}(\theta)=\frac{S(\hat{\theta})-S(\theta)}{\hat{\theta}-\theta} \tag{7.20}\]

and the error approaches zero asymptotically because \(\hat{\theta}\) approaches \(\theta\) (consistency). Equation (7.20) connects the mle \(\hat{\theta}\) to the score function, so the asymptotic behavior of the score function can be applied to \(\hat{\theta}\). Because \(\hat{\theta}\) is the maximum likelihood estimate, \(S(\hat{\theta})=0\), so in the limit,

\[\hat{\theta}-\theta=\frac{S(\theta)}{-S^{\prime}(\theta)}\]

Multiplying both sides by \(\sqrt{n}\), then dividing numerator and denominator by \(n\sqrt{I(\theta)}\),

\[\sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}-\theta)=\frac{\big{\{}\sqrt{n}/[n\sqrt{I(\theta)}]\big{\}} S(\theta)}{-\big{\{}1/[n\sqrt{I(\theta)}]\big{\}}S^{\prime}(\theta)}=\frac{S( \theta)/\sqrt{nI(\theta)}}{-(1/n)S^{\prime}(\theta)/\sqrt{I(\theta)}}\]

Now rewrite \(S(\theta)\) and \(S^{\prime}(\theta)\) as sums using Equation 7.15:

\[\sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}-\theta)=\frac{\frac{1}{n}\big{\{}\frac{\partial}{ \partial\theta}\ln[\!f(X_{1};\theta)]+\cdots+\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln [\!f(X_{n};\theta)]\big{\}}/\sqrt{I(\theta)/n}}{\frac{1}{n}\Big{\{}-\frac{ \partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\ln[\!f(X_{1};\theta)]-\cdots-\frac{\partial^ {2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\ln[\!f(X_{n};\theta)]\Big{\}}/\sqrt{I(\theta)}} \tag{7.21}\]

The denominator braces contain a sum of independent identically distributed rv's each with mean

\[I(\theta)=-E\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}[\ln\!f(X;\theta) ]\bigg{\}}\]

by Equation (7.9). Therefore, by the law of large numbers, the denominator average \(\frac{1}{n}\{\}\) converges to \(I(\theta)\). Thus the denominator converges to \(\sqrt{I(\theta)}\). The numerator average \(\frac{1}{n}\{\}\) is the mean of independent identically distributed rv's with mean 0 [by Equation (7.8)] and variance \(I(\theta)\), so the numerator ratio is an average minus its expected value, divided by its standard deviation. Therefore, by the Central Limit Theorem it is approximately normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Thus, the ratio in Equation (7.21) has a numerator that is approximately \(N(0,\,1)\) and a denominator that is approximately \(\sqrt{I(\theta)}\), so the ratio is approximately \(N(0,\,1/\sqrt{I(\theta)^{2}})=N(0,\,1/I(\theta))\). That is, \(\sqrt{n}(\hat{\theta}-\theta)\) is approximately \(N(0,\,1/I(\theta))\), and it follows that \(\hat{\theta}\) is approximately normal with mean \(\theta\) and variance \(1/[nI(\theta)]\), the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

Continuing with the previous example, let \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) be a random sample from the Bernoulli distribution. The objective is to estimate the proportion \(p\) of drivers who are wearing seat belts. The pmf is \(f(x;\,p)=p^{x}(1-p)^{1-x}\), \(x=0\), \(1\) so the likelihood is

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n};p)=p^{x_{1}+x_{2}+\ldots+x_{n}}(1-p)^{n-(x_{1}+x_{2} +\ldots+x_{n})}\]

Then the log likelihood is

\[\ln[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n};p)]=\sum x_{i}\ln(p)+(n-\sum x_{i})\ln(1-p)\]

and therefore its derivative, the score function, is

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial p}\ln[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n};p)]=\frac{\sum x_{i} }{p}-\frac{n-\sum x_{i}}{1-p}=\frac{\sum x_{i}-np}{p(1-p)}\]

Conclude that the maximum likelihood estimator is \(\hat{p}=\overline{X}=\sum X_{i}/n\). Recall from Example 7.33 that this is unbiased and efficient with the minimum variance of the Cramer-Rao inequality. It is also asymptotically normal by the Central Limit Theorem. These properties are in accord with the asymptotic distribution given by the theorem, \(\hat{p}\sim N(p,1/[nI(p)])\). 

Let \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}\) be a random sample from the distribution with pdf\(f(x;\,\theta)=\theta x^{\theta-1}\) for \(0<x<1\), assuming \(\theta>0\). Here \(X_{i}\), \(i=1,2,\ldots,n\), represents the fraction of a perfect score assigned to the \(i\)th applicant by a recruiting team. The Fisher information is the variance of

\[U=\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln[f(X;\theta)]=\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}[\ln\theta+(\theta-1)\ln(X)]=\frac{1}{\theta}+\ln(X)\]

However, it is easier to use the alternative method of Equation (7.9):

\[I(\theta)=-E\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\ln[f(X;\theta)] \bigg{\}}=-E\bigg{\{}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\bigg{[}\frac{1}{\theta}+ \ln(X)\bigg{]}\bigg{\}}=-E\bigg{\{}\frac{-1}{\theta^{2}}\bigg{\}}=\frac{1}{ \theta^{2}}\]

To obtain the maximum likelihood estimator, we first find the log likelihood:

\[\ln[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)]=\ln(\theta^{n}\prod x_{i}^{\theta-1}) =n\ln(\theta)+(\theta-1)\sum\ln(x_{i})\]

Its derivative, the score function, is

\[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\ln[f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)]=\frac{ n}{\theta}+\sum\ln(x_{i})\]

Setting this to 0, we find that the maximum likelihood estimate is

\[\hat{\theta}=\frac{-1}{\sum\ln(x_{i})/n} \tag{7.22}\]

The expected value of ln(\(X\)) is \(-1/\theta\), because \(E(U)=0\), so the denominator of (7.22) converges in probability to \(-1/\theta\) by the law of large numbers. Therefore \(\hat{\theta}\) converges in probability to \(\theta\), which means that \(\hat{\theta}\) is consistent. We knew this because the mle is always consistent, but it is also nice to show it directly. By the theorem, the asymptotic distribution of \(\hat{\theta}\) is normal with mean \(\theta\) and variance \(1/[nI(\theta)]=\theta^{2}/n\)

Then it can be shown that the minimum variance unbiased estimator for \(\theta\) is \[\hat{\theta}\,=\,\left\{\begin{array}{cl}0&kw\,\leq\,-1\\ P\left(T\!\!<\!\frac{kw\sqrt{n-2}}{\sqrt{1-k^{2}w^{2}}}\right)&-\,1\,<\,kw<1 \\ 1&kw\,\geq\,1\end{array}\right\}\] where \(T\) has a \(t\) distribution with \(n\,-\,2\) df. The article "Big and Bad: How the S.U.V. Ran over Automobile Safety" (_The New Yorker_, Jan. 24,2004) reported that when an engineer with Consumers Union (the product testing and rating organization that publishes _Consumer Reports_) performed three different trials in which a Chevrolet Blazer was accelerated to 60 mph and then suddenly braked, the stopping distances (ft) were 146.2, 151.6, and 153.4, respectively. Assuming that braking distance is normally distributed, obtain the minimum variance unbiased estimate for the probability that distance is at most 150 ft, and compare to the maximum likelihood estimate of this probability.
60. Here is a result that allows for easy identification of a _minimal_ sufficient statistic: Suppose there is a function _t_(_x_1,..., \(x_{n}\)) such that for any two sets of observations \(x\)1,..., \(x_{n}\) and \(y\)1,..., _yn_, the likelihood ratio _f_(_x_1,..., _x__n_', _th_)_/_f_(_y_1,...,., _yn_', _th_) doesn't depend on _th_ if and only if _t_(_x_1,..,., _xn_) = _t_(_y_1,..,., _yn_). Then \(T\) = _t_(_x_1,..,. _xn_) is a minimal sufficient statistic. The result is also valid if _th_ is replaced by _th_1,..., \(b_{k}\), in which case there will typically be several jointly minimal sufficient statistics. For example, if the underlying pdf is exponential with parameter \(l\), then the likelihood ratio is \({}_{i}{}^{2x_{i}-2y_{i}}\), which will not depend on \(l\) if and only if \(\sum x_{i} = \sum y_{i}\), so \(T\) = \(x_{i}\) is a minimal sufficient statistic for \(l\) (and so is the sample mean). **a.**: Identify a minimal sufficient statistic when the _Xi_'s are a random sample from a Poisson distribution. **b.**: Identify a minimal sufficient statistic or jointly minimal sufficient statistics when the _Xi_'s are a random sample from a normal distribution with mean _th_ and variance _th_. **c.**: Identify a minimal sufficient statistic or jointly minimal sufficient statistics when the _Xi_'s are a random sample from a normal distribution with mean _th_ and standard deviation _th_.
61. The principle of unbiasedness (prefer an unbiased estimator to any other) has been criticized on the grounds that in some situations the only unbiased estimator is patently ridiculous. Here is one such example. Suppose that the number of major defects \(X\) on a randomly selected vehicle has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(l\). You are going to purchase two such vehicles and wish to estimate \(\theta = P(X_{1} = 0,\ \ X_{2} = 0) = e^{-2\lambda}\), the probability that neither of these vehicles has any major defects. Your estimate is based on observing the value of \(X\) for a single vehicle. Denote this estimator by \(\hat{\theta} = \delta(X)\). Write the equation implied by the condition of unbiasedness, \(E[\delta(X)] = e^{-2\lambda}\), cancel \(e^{-\lambda}\) from both sides, then expand what remains on the right-hand side in an infinite series, and compare the two sides to determine \(\delta(X)\). If \(X = 200\), what is the estimate? Does this seem reasonable? What is the estimate if \(X = 199?\) Is this reasonable?

Prior to observation, denote the \(y\) values by \(Y\)1, \(Y\)2,..., \(Y_{n}\), where the use of uppercase letters here is appropriate because we are regarding the \(y\) values as random variables. Assume that the _Y__i_'s are independent and normally distributed, with \(Y_{i}\) having mean value \(\beta x_{i}\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). That is, rather than assume that \(y=\beta x\), a linear function of \(x\) passing through the origin, we are assuming that the _mean value_ of \(Y\) is a linear function of \(x\) and that the variance of \(Y\) is the same for any particular \(x\) value. Obtain formulas for the maximum likelihood estimates of \(\beta\) and \(\sigma^{2}\), and then calculate the estimates for the given data. How would you interpret the estimate of \(\beta\)?

## Chapter 6 Statistical Intervals Based on a Single Sample

### 6.1 Introduction

A point estimate, because it is a single number, by itself provides no information about the precision and reliability of estimation. Consider, for example, using the statistic \(\overline{X}\) to calculate a point estimate for the true average breaking strength (g) of paper towels of a certain brand, and suppose that \(\overline{x}=9322.7\). Because of sampling variability, it is virtually never the case that \(\overline{x}=\mu\). The point estimate says nothing about how close it might be to \(\mu\). An alternative to reporting a single sensible value for the parameter being estimated is to calculate and report an entire interval of plausible values--an _interval estimate_ or _confidence interval_ (CI). A confidence interval is always calculated by first selecting a _confidence level_, which is a measure of the degree of reliability of the interval. A confidence interval with a 95% confidence level for the true average breaking strength might have a lower limit of 9162.5 and an upper limit of 9482.9. Then at the 95% confidence level, any value of \(\mu\) between 9162.5 and 9482.9 is plausible. A confidence level of 95% implies that 95% of all samples would give an interval that includes \(\mu\), or whatever other parameter is being estimated, and only 5% of all samples would yield an erroneous interval. The most frequently used confidence levels are 95%, 99%, and 90%. The higher the confidence level, the more strongly we believe that the value of the parameter being estimated lies within the interval (an interpretation of any particular confidence level will be given shortly).

Information about the precision of an interval estimate is conveyed by the width of the interval. If the confidence level is high and the resulting interval is quite narrow, our knowledge of the value of the parameter is reasonably precise. A very wide confidence interval, however, gives the message that there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning the value of what we are estimating. Figure 8.1 shows 95% confidence intervals for true average breaking strengths of twodifferent brands of paper towels. One of these intervals suggests precise knowledge about \(\mu\), whereas the other suggests a very wide range of plausible values.

## 8 Basic Properties of Confidence Intervals

The basic concepts and properties of confidence intervals (CIs) are most easily introduced by first focusing on a simple, albeit somewhat unrealistic, problem situation. Suppose that the parameter of interest is a population mean \(\mu\) and that

**1.**: The population distribution is normal.
**2.**: The value of the population standard deviation \(\sigma\) is known.

Normality of the population distribution is often a reasonable assumption. However, if the value of \(\mu\) is unknown, it is unlikely that the value of \(\sigma\) would be available (knowledge of a population's center typically precedes information concerning spread). In later sections, we will develop methods based on less restrictive assumptions.

Industrial engineers who specialize in ergonomics are concerned with designing workspace and devices operated by workers so as to achieve high productivity and comfort. The article "Studies on Ergonomically Designed Alphanumeric Keyboards" (_Hum. Factors_, 1985: 175-187) reports on a study of preferred height for an experimental keyboard with large forearm-wrist support. A sample of \(n=31\) trained typists was selected, and the preferred keyboard height was determined for each typist. The resulting sample average preferred height was \(\overline{x}=80\) cm. Assuming that the preferred height is normally distributed with \(\sigma=2.0\) cm (a value suggested by data in the article), obtain a CI for \(\mu\), the true average preferred height for the population of all experienced typists.

The actual sample observations \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n}\) are assumed to be the result of a random sample \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) from a normal distribution with mean value \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). The results of Chapter 6 then imply that irrespective of the sample size \(n\), the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) is normally distributed with expected value \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). Standardizing \(\overline{X}\) by first subtracting its expected value and then dividing by its standard deviation yields the variable

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} \tag{8.1}\]

which has a standard normal distribution. Because the area under the standard normal curve between \(-1.96\) and \(1.96\) is.95,

Figure 8.1: Confidence intervals indicating precise (brand 1) and imprecise (brand 2) information about \(\mu\)

\[P\left(-1.96<\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}<1.96\right)=.95 \tag{8.2}\]

The next step in the development is to manipulate the inequalities inside the parentheses in (8.2) so that they appear in the equivalent form \(l<\mu<u\), where the endpoints \(l\) and \(u\) involve \(\overline{X}\) and \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). This is achieved through the following sequence of operations, each one yielding inequalities equivalent to those we started with:

1. Multiply through by \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) to obtain \[-1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}<\overline{X}-\mu<1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{ \sqrt{n}}\]
2. Subtract \(\overline{X}\) from each term to obtain \[-\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}<-\mu<-\overline{X}+1.96\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]
3. Multiply through by \(-1\) to eliminate the minus sign in front of \(\mu\) (which reverses the direction of each inequality) to obtain \[\overline{X}+1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}>\mu>\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\frac {\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\] that is, \[\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}<\mu<\overline{X}+1.96\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\]

Because each set of inequalities in the sequence is equivalent to the original one, the probability associated with each is.95. In particular,

\[P\left(\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}<\mu<\overline{X}+1.96 \cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right)=.95 \tag{8.3}\]

The event inside the parentheses in (8.3) has a somewhat unfamiliar appearance; always before, the random quantity has appeared in the middle with constants on both ends, as in \(a\leq Y\leq b\). In (8.3) the random quantity appears on the two ends, whereas the unknown constant \(\mu\) appears in the middle. To interpret (8.3), think of a **random interval** having left endpoint \(\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) and right endpoint \(\overline{X}+1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\), which in interval notation is

\[\left(\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},\ \overline{X}+1.96\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \tag{8.4}\]

The interval (8.4) is random because the two endpoints of the interval involve a random variable (rv). Note that the interval is centered at the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) and extends \(1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) to each side of \(\overline{X}\). Thus the interval's width is \(2\cdot 1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\), which is not random; only the location of the interval (its midpoint \(\overline{X}\)) is random (Figure 8.2). Now (8.3) can be paraphrased as "_the probability is.95 that the random interval (8.4) includes or covers the true value of \(\mu\)._" Before any experiment is performed and any data is gathered, it is quite likely (probability.95) that \(\mu\) will lie inside the interval in Expression (8.4).

The quantities needed for computation of the 95% CI for true average preferred height are \(\sigma=2.0\), \(n=31\), and \(\pi=80.0\). The resulting interval is

\[\overline{x}\pm 1.96\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}=80.0\pm 1.96\cdot\frac{2.0}{ \sqrt{31}}=80.0\pm.7=(79.3,80.7)\]

That is, we can be highly confident, at the 95% confidence level, that \(79.3<\mu<80.7\). This interval is relatively narrow, indicating that \(\mu\) has been rather precisely estimated.

### Interpreting a Confidence Level

The confidence level 95% for the interval just defined was inherited from the probability.95 for the random interval (8.4). Intervals having other levels of confidence will be introduced shortly. For now, though, consider how 95% confidence can be interpreted.

Because we started with an event whose probability was.95--that the random interval (8.4) would capture the true value of \(\mu\)--and then used the data in Example 8.1 to compute the fixed interval (79.3, 80.7), it is tempting to conclude that \(\mu\) is within this fixed interval with probability.95. But by substituting \(\overline{x}=80\) for \(\overline{X}\), all randomness disappears; the interval (79.3, 80.7) is not a random interval,and \(\mu\) is a constant (unfortunately unknown to us). So it is _incorrect_ to write the statement \(P[\mu\) lies in (79.3, 80.7)] \(=\,.95\).

A correct interpretation of "95% confidence" relies on the long-run relative frequency interpretation of probability: To say that an event \(A\) has probability \(.95\) is to say that if the experiment on which \(A\) is defined is performed over and over again, in the long run \(A\) will occur 95% of the time. Suppose we obtain another sample of typists' preferred heights and compute another 95% interval. Then we consider repeating this for a third sample, a fourth sample, and so on. Let \(A\) be the event that \(\overline{X}-1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\!<\!\mu\!<\!\overline{X}+1.96\cdot\sigma /\sqrt{n}\). Since \(P(A)=.95\), in the long run 95% of our computed CIs will contain \(\mu\). This is illustrated in Figure 8.3, where the vertical line cuts the measurement axis at the true (but unknown) value of \(\mu\). Notice that of the 11 intervals pictured, only intervals 3 and 11 fail to contain \(\mu\). In the long run, only 5% of the intervals so constructed would fail to contain \(\mu\).

According to this interpretation, the confidence level 95% is not so much a statement about any particular interval such as (79.3, 80.7), but pertains to what would happen if a very large number of like intervals were to be constructed using the same formula. Although this may seem unsatisfactory, the root of the difficulty lies with our interpretation of probability--it applies to a long sequence of replications of an experiment rather than just a single replication. There is another approach to the construction and interpretation of CIs that uses the notion of subjective probability and Bayes' theorem, as discussed in Section 14.4. The interval presented here (as well as each interval presented subsequently) is called a "classical" CI because its interpretation rests on the classical notion of probability (although the main ideas were developed as recently as the 1930s).

### Other Levels of Confidence

The confidence level of 95% was inherited from the probability \(.95\) for the initial inequalities in (8.2). If a confidence level of 99% is desired, the initial probability of \(.95\) must be replaced by \(.99\), which necessitates changing the \(z\) critical value from \(1.96\) to \(2.58\). A 99% CI then results from using \(2.58\) in place of \(1.96\) in the formula for the 95% CI.

This suggests that any desired level of confidence can be achieved by replacing \(1.96\) or \(2.58\) with the appropriate standard normal critical value. As Figure 8.4 shows, a probability of \(1\,-\,\alpha\) is achieved by using \(z_{\alpha/2}\) in place of \(1.96\).

Figure 8.3: Repeated construction of 95% CIs

A finite mathematics course has recently been changed, and the homework is now done online via computer instead of from the textbook exercises. How can we see if there has been improvement? Past experience suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is normally distributed with mean 65 and standard deviation 13. It is believed that the distribution is still normal with standard deviation 13, but the mean has likely changed. A sample of 40 students has a mean final exam score of 70.7. Let's calculate a confidence interval for the population mean using a confidence level of 90%. This requires that 100(1 - z) = 90, from which a =.10 and = 1.645 (corresponding to a cumulative _z_-curve area of.9500). The desired interval is then

\[70.7 \pm 1.645 \cdot \frac{13}{\sqrt{40}} = 70.7 \pm 3.4 = (67.3,74.1)\]

With a reasonably high degree of confidence, we can say that 67.3 < \(m\) < 74.1. Furthermore, we are confident that the population mean has improved over the previous value of 65. 

### Confidence Level, Precision, and Choice of Sample Size

Why settle for a confidence level of 95% when a level of 99% is achievable? Because the price paid for the higher confidence level is a wider interval. The 95% interval extends 1.96 \(\cdot \sigma/\sqrt{n}\) to each side of \(\overline{x}\), so the width of the interval is \(2(1.96) \cdot \sigma/\sqrt{n} = 3.92 \cdot \sigma/\sqrt{n}\). Similarly, the width of the 99% interval is \(2(2.58) \cdot \sigma/\sqrt{n} = 5.16 \cdot \sigma/\sqrt{n}\). That is, we have more confidence in the 99% interval precisely because it is wider. The higher the desired degree of confidence, the wider the resulting interval. In fact, the only 100% CI for \(m\) is (\(-\infty\), \(\infty\)), which is not terribly informative because, even before sampling, we knew that this interval covers \(m\).

If we think of the width of the interval as specifying its precision or accuracy, then the confidence level (or reliability) of the interval is inversely related to its precision. A highly reliable interval estimate may be imprecise in that the endpoints of the interval may be far apart, whereas a precise interval may entail relatively low reliability. Thus it cannot be said unequivocally that a 99% interval is to be preferred to a 95% interval; the gain in reliability entails a loss in precision.

An appealing strategy is to specify both the desired confidence level and interval width and then determine the necessary sample size.

Extensive monitoring of a computer time-sharing system has suggested that response time to a particular editing command is normally distributed with standard deviation 25 ms. A new operating system has been installed, and we wish to estimate the true average response time \(\mu\) for the new environment. Assuming that response times are still normally distributed with \(\sigma=25\), what sample size is necessary to ensure that the resulting 95% CI has a width of (at most) 10? The sample size \(n\) must satisfy

\[10=2\cdot(1.96)\cdot(25/\sqrt{n})\]

Rearranging this equation gives

\[\sqrt{n}=2\cdot(1.96)\cdot(25)/10=9.80\]

so

\[n=9.80^{2}=96.04\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, a sample size of 97 is required.

The general formula for the sample size \(n\) necessary to ensure an interval width \(w\) is obtained from \(w=2\cdot z_{a/2}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) as

\[n=\left(2z_{a/2}\cdot\frac{\sigma}{w}\right)^{2} \tag{8.6}\]

The smaller the desired width \(w\), the larger \(n\) must be. In addition, \(n\) is an increasing function of \(\sigma\) (more population variability necessitates a larger sample size) and of the confidence level 100(1 \(-\) ) (as \(\alpha\) decreases, \(z_{a/2}\) increases).

The half-width \(1.96\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) of the 95% CI is sometimes called the **bound on the error of estimation** associated with a 95% confidence level; that is, with 95% confidence, the point estimate \(\overline{x}\) will be no farther than this from \(\mu\). Before obtaining data, an investigator may wish to determine a sample size for which a particular value of the bound is achieved. For example, with \(\mu\) representing the average fuel efficiency (mpg) for all cars of a certain type, the objective of an investigation may be to estimate \(\mu\) to within 1 mpg with 95% confidence. More generally, if we wish to estimate \(\mu\) to within an amount \(B\) (the specified bound on the error of estimation) with 100(1 \(-\) )% confidence, the necessary sample size results from replacing \(2/w\) by 1/\(B\) in (8.6).

### Deriving a Confidence Interval

Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) denote the sample on which the CI for a parameter \(\theta\) is to be based. Suppose a random variable satisfying the following two properties can be found:

1. The variable depends functionally on both \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) and \(\theta\).
2. The probability distribution of the variable does not depend on \(\theta\) or on any other unknown parameters.

Let \(h(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\); \(\theta)\) denote this random variable. For example, if the population distribution is normal with known \(\sigma\) and \(\theta=\mu\), the variable \(h(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)=(\overline{X}-\mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\) satisfies both properties; it clearly depends functionally on \(\mu\), yet has the standard normal probability distribution, which does not depend on \(\mu\). In general, the form of the \(h\) function is usually suggested by examining the distribution of an appropriate estimator \(\hat{\theta}\).

For any \(\alpha\) between 0 and 1, constants \(a\) and \(b\) can be found to satisfy

\[P[a<h(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n};\theta)<b]=1-\alpha \tag{8.7}\]

Because of the second property, \(a\) and \(b\) do not depend on \(\theta\). In the normal example, \(a=-z_{\alpha/2}\) and \(b=z_{\alpha/2}\). Now suppose that the inequalities in (8.7) can be manipulated to isolate \(\theta\), giving the equivalent probability statement

\[P[l(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})<\theta<u(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})]=1-\alpha\]

Then \(l(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n})\) and \(u(x_{1}\),..., \(x_{n})\) are the lower and upper confidence limits, respectively, for a 100(1 - \(\alpha\))% CI. In the normal example, we saw that \(l(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})=\overline{X}-z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) and \(u(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})=\overline{X}+z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\).

A theoretical model suggests that the time to breakdown of an insulating fluid between electrodes at a particular voltage has an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda\) (see Section 4.4). A random sample of \(n=10\) breakdown times yields the following sample data (in min): \(x_{1}=41.53\), \(x_{2}=18.73\), \(x_{3}=2.99\), \(x_{4}=30.34\), \(x_{5}=12.33\), \(x_{6}=117.52\), \(x_{7}=73.02\), \(x_{8}=223.63\), \(x_{9}=4.00\), \(x_{10}=26.78\). A 95% CI for \(\lambda\) and for the true average breakdown time are desired.

Let \(h(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\); \(\lambda)=2\lambda\Sigma X_{i}\). Using a moment generating function argument, it can be shown that this random variable has a chi-squared distribution with \(2n\) degrees of freedom (df) (\(v=2n\), as discussed in Section 6.4). Appendix Table A.6 pictures a typical chi-squared density curve and tabulates critical values that capture specified tail areas. The relevant number of degrees of freedom here is \(2(10)=20\). The \(v=20\) row of the table shows that 34.170 captures upper-tail area.025 and 9.591 captures lower-tail area.025 (upper-tail area.975). Thus for \(n=10\),

\[P(9.591<2\lambda\Sigma X_{i}<34.170)=.95\]

Division by \(2\Sigma X_{i}\) isolates \(\lambda\), yielding

\[P[9.591/(2\Sigma X_{i})<\lambda<34.170/(2\Sigma X_{i})]=.95\]The lower limit of the 95% CI for \(\lambda\) is 9.591/(2\(\Sigma x_{i}\)), and the upper limit is 34.170/(2\(\Sigma x_{i}\)). For the given data, \(\Sigma x_{i}=550.87\), giving the interval (.00871,.03101).

The expected value of an exponential rv is \(\mu=1/\lambda\). Since

\[P(2\Sigma X_{i}/34.170<1/\lambda<2\Sigma X_{i}/9.591)=.95\]

the 95% CI for true average breakdown time is (2\(\Sigma x_{i}\)/34.170, 2\(\Sigma x_{i}\)/9.591) = (32.24, 114.87). This interval is obviously quite wide, reflecting substantial variability in breakdown times and a small sample size. \(\blacksquare\)

In general, the upper and lower confidence limits result from replacing each \(<\) in (8.7) by \(=\) and solving for \(\theta\). In the insulating fluid example just considered, 2\(\lambda\Sigma x_{i}=34.170\) gives \(\lambda=34.170\)/(2\(\Sigma x_{i}\)) as the upper confidence limit, and the lower limit is obtained from the other equation. Notice that the two interval limits are not equidistant from the point estimate, since the interval is not of the form \(\hat{\theta}\pm c\).

## Large-Sample Confidence Intervals

for a Population Mean and Proportion

The CI for \(\mu\) given in the previous section assumed that the population distribution is normal and that the value of \(\sigma\) is known. We now present a large-sample CI whose validity does not require these assumptions. After showing how the argument leading to this interval generalizes to yield other large-sample intervals, we focus on an interval for a population proportion \(p\).

## A Large-Sample Interval for \(\mu\)

Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a population having a mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\). Provided that \(n\) is large, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) implies that \(\overline{X}\) has approximately a normal distribution whatever the nature of the population distribution. It then follows that \(Z=(\overline{X}-\mu)/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\) has approximately a standard normal distribution, so that

\[P\biggl{(}-z_{\alpha/2}<\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}<z_{\alpha/2} \biggr{)}\approx 1-\alpha\]

An argument parallel with that given in Section 8.1 yields \(\overline{x}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) as a large-sample CI for \(\mu\) with a confidence level of _approximately_\(100(1-\alpha)\%\). That is, when \(n\) is large, the CI for \(\mu\) given previously remains valid whatever the population distribution, provided that the qualifier "approximately" is inserted in front of the confidence level.

One practical difficulty with this development is that computation of the interval requires the value of \(\sigma\), which will almost never be known. Consider the standardized variable

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}\]

in which the sample standard deviation \(S\) replaces \(\sigma\). Previously there was randomness only in the numerator of \(Z\) (by virtue of \(\overline{X}\)). Now there is randomness in both the numerator and the denominator--the values of both \(\overline{X}\) and \(S\) vary from sample to sample. However, when \(n\) is large, the use of \(S\) rather than \(\sigma\) adds very little extra variability to \(Z\). More specifically, in this case the new \(Z\) also has approximately a standard normal distribution. Manipulation of the inequalities in a probability statement involving this new \(Z\) yields a general large-sample interval for \(\mu\).

If \(n\) is sufficiently large, the standardized variable

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}\]

has approximately a standard normal distribution. This implies that

\[\overline{x}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \tag{8.8}\]

is a **large-sample confidence interval for \(\mu\)** with confidence level approximately \(100(1-\alpha)\%\). This formula is valid regardless of the shape of the population distribution.

Generally speaking, \(n>40\) will be sufficient to justify the use of this interval. This is somewhat more conservative than the rule of thumb for the CLT because of the additional variability introduced by using \(S\) in place of \(\sigma\).

A boxplot of the data (Figure 8.5) shows that, except for the two mild outliers at the upper end, the distribution of values is reasonably symmetric (in fact, a normal probability plot exhibits a reasonably linear pattern, though the points corresponding to the two smallest and two largest observations are somewhat removed from a line fit through the remaining points).

Summary quantities include \(n=50\), \(\bar{x}=45\),\(679.4\), \(\tilde{x}=45\),\(013.5\), \(s=26\),\(641.675\), \(f_{s}=34\),\(265\). The mean and median are reasonably close (if the two largest values were each reduced by 30,000, the mean would fall to 44,479.4 while the median would be unaffected). The boxplot and the magnitudes of \(s\) and \(f_{s}\) relative to the mean and median both indicate a substantial amount of variability. A confidence level of about 95% requires \(z_{.025}=1.96\), and the interval is

\[45\text{,}679.4\pm(1.96)\left(\frac{26\text{,}641.675}{\sqrt{50}}\right)=45 \text{,}679.4\pm 7384.7=(38\text{,}294.7\text{, }53\text{,}064.1)\]

That is, 38,294.7 \(<\mu<\) 53,064.1 with 95% confidence. This interval is rather wide because a sample size of 50, even though large by our rule of thumb, is not large enough to overcome the substantial variability in the sample. We do not have a very precise estimate of the population mean odometer reading.

Is the interval we've calculated one of the 95% that in the long run includes the parameter being estimated, or is it one of the "bad" 5% that does not do so? Without knowing the value of \(\mu\), we cannot tell. Remember that the confidence

Figure 8.5: A boxplot of the odometer reading data from Example 8.6

level refers to the long run capture percentage when the formula is used repeatedly on various samples; it cannot be interpreted for a single sample and the resulting interval.

Unfortunately, the choice of sample size to yield a desired interval width is not as straightforward here as it was for the case of known \(\sigma\). This is because the width of (8.8) is \(2z_{a/2}s/\sqrt{n}\). Since the value of \(s\) is not available before data collection, the width of the interval cannot be determined solely by the choice of \(n\). The only option for an investigator who wishes to specify a desired width is to make an educated guess as to what the value of \(s\) might be. By being conservative and guessing a larger value of \(s\), an \(n\) larger than necessary will be chosen. The investigator may be able to specify a reasonably accurate value of the population range (the difference between the largest and smallest values). Then if the population distribution is not too skewed, dividing the range by four gives a ballpark value of what \(s\) might be. The idea is that roughly 95% of the data lie within \(\pm 2\sigma\) of the mean, so the range is roughly \(4\sigma\) (range/6 might be too optimistic).

An investigator wishes to estimate the true average score on an algebra placement test. Suppose she believes that virtually all values in the population are between 10 and 30. Then \((30-10)/4=5\) gives a reasonable value for \(s\). The appropriate sample size for estimating the true average mileage to within one with confidence level 95%--that is, for the 95% CI to have a width of 2--is

\[n=[(1.96)(5)/1]^{2}\approx 96\]

### A General Large-Sample Confidence Interval

The large-sample intervals \(\overline{x}\pm z_{a/2}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) and \(\overline{x}\pm z_{a/2}\cdot s/\sqrt{n}\) are special cases of a general large-sample CI for a parameter \(\theta\). Suppose that \(\hat{\theta}\) is an estimator satisfying the following properties: (1) It has approximately a normal distribution; (2) it is (at least approximately) unbiased; and (3) an expression for \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\), the standard deviation of \(\hat{\theta}\), is available. For example, in the case \(\theta=\mu\), \(\hat{\mu}=\overline{X}\) is an unbiased estimator whose distribution is approximately normal when \(n\) is large and \(\sigma_{\hat{\mu}}=\sigma_{\overline{x}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). Standardizing \(\hat{\theta}\) yields the rv \(Z=(\hat{\theta}-\theta)/\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\), which has approximately a standard normal distribution. This justifies the probability statement

\[P\left(-z_{a/2}<\frac{\hat{\theta}-\theta}{\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}}<z_{a/2} \right)\approx 1-\alpha\]

Suppose, first, that \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) does not involve any unknown parameters (e.g., known \(\sigma\) in the case \(\theta=\mu\)). Then replacing each \(<\) in (8.9) by \(=\) results in \(\theta=\hat{\theta}\pm z_{a/2}\cdot\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\), so the lower and upper confidence limits are \(\hat{\theta}-z_{a/2}\cdot\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) and \(\hat{\theta}+z_{a/2}\cdot\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\), respectively. Now suppose that \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) does not involve \(\theta\) but does involve at least one other unknown parameter. Let \(s_{\hat{\theta}}\) be the estimate of \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) obtained by using estimates in place of the unknown parameters (e.g., \(s/\sqrt{n}\) estimates \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)). Under general conditions (essentially that \(s_{\hat{\theta}}\) be close to \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) for most samples), a valid CI is \(\hat{\theta}\pm z_{a/2}\cdot s_{\hat{\theta}}\). The interval \(\overline{x}\pm z_{a/2}\cdot s/\sqrt{n}\) is an example.

Finally, suppose that \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) does involve the unknown \(\theta\). This is the case, for example, when \(\theta=p\), a population proportion. Then \((\hat{\theta}-\theta)/\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}=z_{\mathrm{a}/2}\) can be difficult to solve. An approximate solution can often be obtained by replacing \(\theta\) in \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) by its estimate \(\hat{\theta}\). This results in an estimated standard deviation \(s_{\hat{\theta}}\), and the corresponding interval is again \(\hat{\theta}\pm z_{\mathrm{a}/2}\cdot s_{\hat{\theta}}\).

### A Confidence Interval for a Population Proportion

Let \(p\) denote the proportion of "successes" in a population, where _success_ identifies an individual or object that has a specified property. A random sample of \(n\) individuals is to be selected, and \(X\) is the number of successes in the sample. Provided that \(n\) is small compared to the population size, \(X\) can be regarded as a binomial rv with \(E(X)=np\) and \(\sigma_{X}=\sqrt{np(1-p)}\). Furthermore, if \(n\) is large (\(np\geq 10\) and \(nq\geq 10\)), \(X\) has approximately a normal distribution.

The natural estimator of \(p\) is \(\hat{p}=X/n\), the sample fraction of successes. Since \(\hat{p}\) is just \(X\) multiplied by a constant \(1/n\), \(\hat{p}\) also has approximately a normal distribution. As shown in Section 7.1, \(E(\hat{p})=p\) (unbiasedness) and \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}\). The standard deviation \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}\) involves the unknown parameter \(p\). Standardizing \(\hat{p}\) by subtracting \(p\) and dividing by \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}\) then implies that

\[P\left(-z_{\mathrm{a}/2}<\frac{\hat{p}-p}{\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}}<z_{\mathrm{a}/2} \right)\approx 1-\alpha\]

Proceeding as suggested in the subsection "Deriving a Confidence Interval" (Section 8.1), the confidence limits result from replacing each \(<\) by \(=\) and solving the resulting quadratic equation for \(p\). With \(\hat{q}=1-\hat{p}\), this gives the two roots

\[p =\frac{\hat{p}+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/2n}{1+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/n} \pm z_{\mathrm{a}/z}\ \frac{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/4n^{2}}}{1+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/n}\] \[=\tilde{p}\pm z_{\mathrm{a}/2}\,\frac{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n+z_{ \mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/4n^{2}}}{1+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/n}\]

**PROPOSITION**: Let \(\tilde{p}=\frac{\hat{p}+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/2n}{1+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/n}\). Then a **confidence interval for a population proportion \(p\)** with confidence level approximately \(100(1\ -\ \alpha)\%\) is

\[\tilde{p}\ \pm\ \ z_{\mathrm{a}/2}\ \frac{\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}/n+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/4n^{2}}}{1+z_{\mathrm{a}/2}^{2}/n} \tag{8.10}\]

where \(\hat{q}=1-\hat{p}\) and, as before, the \(-\) in (8.10) corresponds to the lower confidence limit and the \(+\) to the upper confidence limit.

This is often referred to as the "score CI" for \(p\).

If the sample size \(n\) is very large, then \(z^{2}/2n\) is generally quite negligible (small) compared to \(\hat{p}\) and \(z^{2}/n\) is quite negligible compared to 1, from which \(\tilde{p}\approx\hat{p}\). In this case \(z^{2}/4n^{2}\) is also negligible compared to \(\hat{p}\hat{q}/n\) (\(n^{2}\) is a much larger divisor than is \(n\)); as a result, the dominant term in the \(\pm\) expression is \(z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}/n}\) and the score interval is approximately

\[\hat{p}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}/n} \tag{8.11}\]

This latter interval has the general form \(\hat{\theta}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}\) of a large-sample interval suggested in the last subsection. The approximate CI (8.11) is the one that for decades has appeared in introductory statistics textbooks. It clearly has a much simpler and more appealing form than the score CI. So why bother with the latter?

First of all, suppose we use \(z_{\alpha 25}=1.96\) in the traditional formula (8.11). Then our _nominal_ confidence level (the one we think we're buying by using that \(z\) critical value) is approximately 95%. So before a sample is selected, the probability that the random interval includes the actual value of \(p\) (i.e., the _coverage probability_) should be about.95. But as Figure 8.6 shows for the case \(n=100\), the actual coverage probability for this interval can differ considerably from the nominal probability.95, particularly when \(p\) is not close to.5 (the graph of coverage probability versus \(p\) is very jagged because the underlying binomial probability distribution is discrete rather than continuous). This is generally speaking a deficiency of the traditional interval - the actual confidence level can be quite different from the nominal level even for reasonably large sample sizes. Recent research has shown that the score interval rectifies this behavior - for virtually all sample sizes and values of \(p\), its actual confidence level will be quite close to the nominal level specified by the choice of \(z_{\alpha/2}\). This is due largely to the fact that the score interval is shifted a bit toward.5 compared to the traditional interval. In particular, the midpoint \(\tilde{p}\) of the score interval is always a bit closer to.5 than is the midpoint \(\hat{p}\) of the traditional interval. This is especially important when \(p\) is close to 0 or 1.

In addition, the score interval can be used with nearly all sample sizes and parameter values. It is thus not necessary to check the conditions \(n\hat{p}\geq 10\) and \(n(1-\hat{p})\geq 10\) which would be required were the traditional interval employed. So rather than asking when \(n\) is large enough for (8.11) to yield a good approximation

Figure 8.6: Actual coverage probability for the interval (8.11) for varying values of \(p\) when \(n=100\)

to (8.10), our recommendation is that the score CI should _always_ be used. The slight additional tediousness of the computation is outweighed by the desirable properties of the interval.

The article "Repeatability and Reproducibility for Pass/Fail Data" (_J. Testing Eval._, 1997: 151-153) reported that in \(n=48\) trials in a particular laboratory, 16 resulted in ignition of a particular type of substrate by a lighted cigarette. Let \(p\) denote the long-run proportion of all such trials that would result in ignition. A point estimate for \(p\) is \(\hat{p}=16/48=.333\). A confidence interval for \(p\) with a confidence level of approximately 95% is

\[\frac{.333+1.96^{2}/96}{1+1.96^{2}/48}\pm 1.96\frac{\sqrt{(.333)(.667)/48 +1.96^{2}/(4\cdot 48^{2})}}{1+1.96^{2}/48}\] \[=.346\pm.129=(.217,.475)\]

The traditional interval is

\[.333\pm 1.96\sqrt{(.333)(.667)/48}=.333\pm.133=(.200,.466)\]

These two intervals would be in much closer agreement were the sample size substantially larger.

Equating the width of the CI for \(p\) to a prespecified width \(w\) gives a quadratic equation for the sample size \(n\) necessary to give an interval with a desired degree of precision. Suppressing the subscript in \(z_{a/2}\), the solution is

\[n=\frac{2z^{2}\hat{p}\hat{q}-z^{2}w^{2}\pm\sqrt{4z^{4}\hat{p}\hat{q}(\hat{p} \hat{q}-w^{2})+w^{2}z^{4}}}{w^{2}} \tag{8.12}\]

Neglecting the terms in the numerator involving \(w^{2}\) gives

\[n=\frac{4z^{2}\hat{p}\hat{q}}{w^{2}}\]

This latter expression is what results from equating the width of the traditional interval to \(w\).

These formulas unfortunately involve the unknown \(p\). The most conservative approach is to take advantage of the fact that \(\hat{p}\hat{q}[=\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})]\) is a maximum when \(\hat{p}=.5\). Thus if \(\hat{p}=\hat{q}=.5\) is used in (8.12), the width will be at most \(w\) regardless of what value of \(\hat{p}\) results from the sample. Alternatively, if the investigator believes strongly, based on prior information, that \(p\leq p_{0}\leq.5\), then \(p_{0}\) can be used in place of \(\hat{p}\). A similar comment applies when \(p\geq p_{0}\geq.5\).

The width of the 95% CI in Example 8.8 is.258. The value of \(n\) necessary to ensure a width of.10 irrespective of the value of \(p\) is

\[n =\frac{2(1.96)^{2}(.25)-(1.96)^{2}(.01)\pm\sqrt{4(1.96)^{4}(.25)(. 25-.01)+(.01)(1.96)^{4}}}{.01}\] \[=380.3\]Thus a sample size of 381 should be used. The expression for \(n\) based on the traditional CI gives a slightly larger value of 385. \(\blacksquare\)

### One-Sided Confidence Intervals (Confidence Bounds)

The confidence intervals discussed thus far give both a lower confidence bound _and_ an upper confidence bound for the parameter being estimated. In some circumstances, an investigator will want only one of these two types of bounds. For example, a psychologist may wish to calculate a 95% upper confidence bound for true average reaction time to a particular stimulus, or a surgeon may want only a lower confidence bound for true average remission time after colon cancer surgery. Because the cumulative area under the standard normal curve to the left of 1.645 is.95,

\[P\left(\frac{X-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}<1.645\right)\approx.95\]

Manipulating the inequality inside the parentheses to isolate \(\mu\) on one side and replacing rv's by calculated values gives the inequality \(\mu>\tau-1.645s/\sqrt{n}\); the expression on the right is the desired lower confidence bound. Starting with \(P(-1.645<Z)\approx.95\) and manipulating the inequality results in the upper confidence bound. A similar argument gives a one-sided bound associated with any other confidence level.

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & A large-sample upper confidence bound for \(\mu\) is \\  & \(\mu<\overline{x}+z_{a}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\) \\  & and a large-sample lower confidence bound for \(\mu\) is \\  & \(\mu>\tau-z_{a}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\) \\  & A one-sided confidence bound for \(p\) results from replacing \(z_{a/2}\) by \(z_{a}\) and \(\pm\) by either + or - in the CI formula (8.10) for \(p\). In all cases the confidence level is approximately 100(1 \(-\)\(\alpha\))%. \\ \end{tabular}

A random sample of 50 patients who had been seen at an outpatient clinic was selected, and the waiting time to see a physician was determined for each one, resulting in a sample mean time of 40.3 min and a sample standard deviation of 28.0 min (suggested by the article "An Example of Good but Partially Successful OR Engagement: Improving Outpatient Clinic Operations", _Interfaces_ 28, #5). An upper confidence bound for true average waiting time with a confidence level of roughly 95% is \[40.3+(1.645)(28.0)/\sqrt{50}=40.3+6.5=46.8\]

That is, with a confidence level of about 95%, \(\mu<46.8\). Note that the sample standard deviation is quite large relative to the sample mean. If these were the values of \(\sigma\) and \(\mu\), respectively, then population normality would not be sensible because there would then be quite a large probability of obtaining a negative waiting time. But because \(n\) is large here, our confidence bound is valid even though the population distribution is probably positively skewed. 

A random sample of 110 lightning flashes in a region resulted in a sample average radar echo duration of.81 s and a sample standard deviation of.34 s ("Lightning Strikes to an Airplane in a Thunderstorm," _J.

## 8.3 Intervals Based on a Normal Population Distribution

The CI for \(\mu\) presented in Section 8.2 is valid provided that \(n\) is large. The resulting interval can be used whatever the nature of the population distribution. The CLT cannot be invoked, however, when \(n\) is small. In this case, one way to proceed is to make a specific assumption about the form of the population distribution and then derive a CI tailored to that assumption. For example, we could develop a CI for \(\mu\) when the population is described by a gamma distribution, another interval for the case of a Weibull population, and so on. Statisticians have indeed carried out this program for a number of different distributional families. Because the normal distribution is more frequently appropriate as a population model than is any other type of distribution, we will focus here on a CI for this situation.

The population of interest is normal, so that \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) constitutes a random sample from a normal distribution with both \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) unknown.

The key result underlying the interval in Section 8.2 is that for large \(n\), the rv \(Z=(\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\) has approximately a standard normal distribution. When \(n\) is small, \(S\) is no longer likely to be close to \(\sigma\), so the variability in the distribution of \(Z\) arises from randomness in both the numerator and the denominator. This implies that the probability distribution of \((\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\) will be more spread out than the standard normal distribution. Inferences are based on the following result from Section 6.4 using the family of \(t\)_distributions_:

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{THEOREM}&\text{When $\overline{X}$ is the mean of a random sample of size $n$ from a normal distribution}\\ &\text{with mean $\mu$, the rv}\\ &\\ &T=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}\end{array} \tag{8.13}\]

has the \(t\) distribution with \(n\,-\,1\) degrees of freedom (df).

## Properties of \(t\) Distributions

Before applying this theorem, a review of properties of \(t\) distributions is in order. Although the variable of interest is still \((\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\), we now denote it by \(T\) to emphasize that it does not have a standard normal distribution when \(n\) is small. Recall that a normal distribution is governed by two parameters, the mean \(\mu\) and the standard deviation \(\sigma\). A \(t\) distribution is governed by only one parameter, the **number of degrees of freedom** of the distribution, abbreviated df and denoted by \(v\). Possible values of \(v\) are the positive integers 1, 2, 3,.... Each different value of \(v\) corresponds to a different \(t\) distribution.

The density function for a random variable having a \(t\) distribution was derived in Section 6.4. It is quite complicated, but fortunately we need concern ourselves only with several of the more important features of the corresponding density curves.

**PROPERTIES OF \(T\) DISTRIBUTIONS**

**1.** Each \(t_{v}\) curve is bell-shaped and centered at 0.

**2.** Each \(t_{v}\) curve is more spread out than the standard normal (\(z\)) curve.

**3.** As \(v\) increases, the spread of the \(t_{v}\) curve decreases.

**4.** As \(v\rightarrow\infty\), the sequence of \(t_{v}\) curves approaches the standard normal curve (so the \(z\) curve is often called the \(t\) curve with df \(=\infty\)).

Recall the notation for values that capture particular upper-tail \(t\)-curve areas.

**NOTATION**: Let \(t_{\alpha,v}=\) the number on the measurement axis for which the area under the \(t\) curve with \(v\) df to the right of \(t_{\alpha,v}\), is \(\alpha\); \(t_{\alpha,v}\) is called a \(t\)**critical value.**

This notation is illustrated in Figure 8.7. Appendix Table A.5 gives \(t_{\alpha,v}\) for selected values of \(\alpha\) and \(v\). The columns of the table correspond to different values of \(\alpha\). To obtain \(t_{.05,15}\), go to the \(\alpha=.05\) column, look down to the \(v=15\) row, and read \(t_{.05,15}=1.753\). Similarly, \(t_{.05,22}=1.717\) (\(.05\) column, \(v=22\) row), and \(t_{.01,22}=2.508\).

The values of \(t_{\alpha,v}\) exhibit regular behavior as we move across a row or down a column. For fixed \(v\), \(t_{\alpha,v}\) increases as \(\alpha\) decreases, since we must move farther to theright of zero to capture area \(a\) in the tail. For fixed \(a\), as \(v\) is increased (i.e., as we look down any particular column of the \(t\) table) the value of _t_a,\(v\) decreases. This is because a larger value of \(v\) implies a \(t\) distribution with smaller spread, so it is not necessary to go so far from zero to capture tail area \(a\). Furthermore, _t_a,\(v\), decreases more slowly as \(v\) increases. Consequently, the table values are shown in increments of 2 between 30 and 40 df and then jump to \(v\) = 50, 60, 120, and finally. Because _t_a is the standard normal curve, the familiar _z_a values appear in the last row of the table. The rule of thumb suggested earlier for use of the large-sample CI (if \(n\) > 40) comes from the approximate equality of the standard normal and \(t\) distributions for \(v\) >= 40.

### The One-Sample \(t\) Confidence Interval

The standardized variable \(T\) has a \(t\) distribution with \(n\) - 1 df, and the area under the corresponding \(t\) density curve between -_t_a/2,_n_-1 and _t_a/2,_n_-1 is 1 - \(a\) (area _a_/2 lies in each tail), so

\[P( - t_{\alpha/2,n - 1} < T < t_{\alpha/2,n - 1} ) = 1 - \alpha\]

Expression (8.14) differs from expressions in previous sections in that \(T\) and _t_a/2,_n_-1 are used in place of \(Z\) and _z_a/2, but it can be manipulated in the same manner to obtain a confidence interval for \(m\).

##### **Proposition**

Let \(x\) and \(s\) be the sample mean and sample standard deviation computed from the results of a random sample from a normal population with mean \(m\). Then a **100(1 - _a_)% confidence interval for _m_**, the **one-sample \(t\) CI**, is

\[\left( \overline{x} - t_{\alpha/2,n - 1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\overline{x} + t_{\alpha/2,n - 1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right)\]

or, more compactly, \(\overline{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2,n - 1} \cdot s/\sqrt{n}\).

An **upper confidence bound for _m_** is

\[\overline{x} + t_{\alpha,n - 1} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]

and replacing + by - in this latter expression gives a **lower confidence bound for _m_**; both have confidence level 100(1 - _a_)%.

##### **Example** **6.11**

Here are the alcohol percentages for a sample of 16 beers (light beers excluded):

\[\begin{array}{cccccccc}4.68&4.13&4.80&4.63&5.08&5.79&6.29&6.79\\ 4.93&4.25&5.70&4.74&5.88&6.77&6.04&4.95\\ \end{array}\]

Figure 8.8 shows a normal probability plot obtained from SAS. The plot is sufficiently straight for the percentage to be assumed approximately normal.

The mean is \(\overline{x}=5.34\) and the standard deviation is \(s=.8483\). The sample size is 16, so a confidence interval for the population mean percentage is based on 15 df. A confidence level of 95% for a two-sided interval requires the \(t\) critical value of 2.131. The resulting interval is

\[\overline{x}\pm t_{.025,15}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} =5.34\pm(2.131)\,\frac{.8483}{\sqrt{16}}\] \[=5.34\pm.45=(4.89,\ 5.79)\]

A 95% lower bound would use \(-1.753\) in place of \(\pm 2.131\). It is interesting that the 95% confidence interval is consistent with the usual statement about the equivalence of wine and beer in terms of alcohol content. That is, assuming an alcohol percentage of 13% for wine, a 5-oz serving yields.65 oz of alcohol, while, assuming 5.34% alcohol, a 12-oz serving of beer has.64 oz of alcohol.

Unfortunately, it is not easy to select \(n\) to control the width of the \(t\) interval. This is because the width involves the unknown (before data collection) \(s\) and because \(n\) enters not only through \(1/\sqrt{n}\) but also through \(t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\). As a result, an appropriate \(n\) can be obtained only by trial and error.

In Chapter 14, we will discuss a small-sample CI for \(\mu\) that is valid provided only that the population distribution is symmetric, a weaker assumption than normality. However, when the population distribution is normal, the \(t\) interval tends to be shorter than would be _any_ other interval with the same confidence level.

### A Prediction Interval for a Single Future Value

In many applications, an investigator wishes to _predict a_ single value of a variable to be observed at some future time, rather than to _estimate_ the mean value of that variable.

Consider the following sample of fat content (in percentage) of \(n=10\) randomly selected hot dogs ("Sensory and Mechanical Assessment of the Quality of Frankfurters," _J. Texture Stud._, 1990: 395-409):

Figure 8.8: A normal probability plot of the alcohol percentage data

Assuming that these were selected from a normal population distribution, a 95% CI for (interval estimate of) the population mean fat content is

\[\begin{equation*}{\overline{x}}\pm t_{025,9}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}=21.90\pm 2.262 \cdot\frac{4.134}{\sqrt{10}}=21.90\pm 2.96=(18.94,24.86)\end{equation*}\]

Suppose, however, you are going to eat a single hot dog of this type and want a _prediction_ for the resulting fat content. A _point prediction_, analogous to a _point estimate_, is just \(\overline{x}=21.90\). This prediction unfortunately gives no information about reliability or precision. 

The general setup is as follows: We will have available a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) from a normal population distribution, and we wish to predict the value of \(X_{n+1}\), a single future observation. A point predictor is \(\overline{X}\), and the resulting prediction error is \(\overline{X}-X_{n+1}\). The expected value of the prediction error is

\[E(\overline{X}-X_{n+1})=E(\overline{X})-E(X_{n+1})=\mu-\mu=0\]

Since \(X_{n+1}\) is independent of \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\), it is independent of \(\overline{X}\), so the variance of the prediction error is

\[V(\overline{X}-X_{n+1})=V(\overline{X})+V(X_{n+1})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}+ \sigma^{2}=\sigma^{2}\bigg{(}1+\frac{1}{n}\bigg{)}\]

The prediction error is a linear combination of independent normally distributed rv's, so itself is normally distributed. Thus

\[Z=\frac{(\overline{X}-X_{n+1})-0}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}\big{(}1+\frac{1}{n}\big{)}} }=\frac{\overline{X}-X_{n+1}}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}\big{(}1+\frac{1}{n}\big{)}}}\]

has a standard normal distribution. As in the derivation of the distribution of \((\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\) in Section 6.4, it can be shown (Exercise 43) that replacing \(\sigma\) by the sample standard deviation \(S\) (of \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\)) results in

\[T=\frac{\overline{X}-X_{n+1}}{S\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}}\sim t\;\text{distribution with}\;n\,-\,1\;\text{df}\]

Manipulating this \(T\) variable as \(T=(\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\) was manipulated in the development of a CI gives the following result.

**PROPOSITION**: A **prediction interval (PI)** for a single observation to be selected from a normal population distribution is

\[\begin{equation*}{\overline{x}}\pm t_{a/2,n-1}\cdot s\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}}\end{equation*}\]

The _prediction level_ is \(100(1\,-\,\alpha)\%\).

The interpretation of a 95% prediction level is similar to that of a 95% confidence level; if the interval (8.16) is calculated for sample after sample, in the long run 95% of these intervals will include the corresponding future values of \(X\).

With \(n\) = 10, \(\bar{\tau}=21.90\), \(s\) = 4.134, and \(t\).025,9 = 2.262, a 95% PI for the fat content of a single hot dog is

\[21.90\pm(2.262)(4.134)\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{10}}=21.90\pm 9.81=(12.09,31.71)\]

This interval is quite wide, indicating substantial uncertainty about fat content. Notice that the width of the PI is more than three times that of the CI.

The error of prediction is \(\overline{X}-X_{n+1}\), a difference between two random variables, whereas the estimation error is \(\overline{X}-\mu\), the difference between a random variable and a fixed (but unknown) value. The PI is wider than the CI because there is more variability in the prediction error (due to \(X_{n+1}\)) than in the estimation error. In fact, as \(n\) gets arbitrarily large, the CI shrinks to the single value \(\mu\), and the PI approaches \(\mu\pm x_{a\!/\!2}\cdot\!\sigma\). There is uncertainty about a single \(X\) value even when there is no need to estimate.

### Tolerance Intervals

In addition to confidence intervals and prediction intervals, statisticians are sometimes called upon to obtain a third type of interval called a _tolerance interval_ (TI). A TI is an interval that with a high degree of reliability captures at least a specified percentage of the \(x\) values in a population distribution. For example, if the population distribution of fuel efficiency is normal, then the interval from \(\mu\,-\,1.645\sigma\) to \(\mu\,+\,1.645\sigma\) captures 90% of the fuel efficiency values in the population. It can then be shown that if \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) are replaced by their natural estimates \(\overline{x}\) and \(s\) based on a sample of size \(n\) = 20 and the \(z\) critical value 1.645 is replaced by a _tolerance critical value_ 2.310, the resulting interval contains at least 90% of the population values with a confidence level of 95%.

Please consult one of the chapter references for more information on TIs. And before you calculate a particular statistical interval, be sure that it is the correct type of interval to fulfill your objective!

### Intervals Based on Nonnormal Population Distributions

The one-sample \(t\) CI for \(\mu\) is robust to small or even moderate departures from normality unless \(n\) is quite small. By this we mean that if a critical value for 95% confidence, for example, is used in calculating the interval, the actual confidence level will be reasonably close to the nominal 95% level. If, however, \(n\) is small and the population distribution is highly nonnormal, then the actual confidence level may be considerably different from the one you think you are using when you obtain a particular critical value from the \(t\) table. It would certainly be distressing to believe that your confidence level is about 95% when in fact it was really more like 88%! The bootstrap technique, discussed in the last section of this chapter, has been found to be quite successful at estimating parameters in a wide variety of nonnormal situations.

In contrast to the confidence interval, the validity of the prediction intervals described in this section is closely tied to the normality assumption. These latter intervals should not be used in the absence of compelling evidence for normality. The excellent reference _Statistical Intervals_, cited in the bibliography at the end of this chapter, discusses alternative procedures of this sort for various other situations.

## Chapter 8 Confidence Intervals for the Variance and Standard Deviation of a Normal Population

Although inferences concerning a population variance \(\sigma^{2}\) or standard deviation \(s\) are usually of less interest than those about a mean or proportion, there are occasions when such procedures are needed. In the case of a normal population distribution, inferences are based on the following result from Section 6.4 concerning the sample variance \(S^{2}\).

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a normal distribution with parameters \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\). Then the rv \\  & \(\frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)^{2}}{ \sigma^{2}}\) \\  & has a chi-squared (\(\chi^{2}\)) probability distribution with \(n\,-\,1\) df. \\ \end{tabular}

As discussed in Sections 4.4 and 6.4, the chi-squared distribution is a continuous probability distribution with a single parameter \(v\), the number of degrees of freedom, with possible values 1, 2, 3,.... To specify inferential procedures that use the chi-squared distribution, recall the notation for critical values from Section 6.4.

\begin{tabular}{c c} NOTATION & Let \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,v}\), called a **chi-squared critical value**, denote the number on the measurement axis such that \(\alpha\) of the area under the chi-squared curve with \(v\) df lies to the right of \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,v}\). \\ \end{tabular}

Because the \(t\) distribution is symmetric, it was necessary to tabulate only upper-tail critical values (\(t_{\alpha,v}\) for small values of \(\alpha\)). The chi-squared distribution is not symmetric, so Appendix Table A.6 contains values of \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,v}\) for \(\alpha\) both near 0 and near 1, as illustrated in Figure 8.9(b). For example, \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,025,14}\,=\,26.119\) and \(\chi^{2}_{\beta 5,20}\) (the 5th percentile) \(=\,10.851\).

The rv (_n_ - 1)S2/s2 satisfies the two properties on which the general method for obtaining a CI is based: It is a function of the parameter of interest \(s\)2, yet its probability distribution (chi-squared) does not depend on this parameter. The area under a chi-squared curve with \(v\) df to the right of _kh_2/2,\(v\) is a/2, as is the area to the left of _kh_2/2,\(v\). Thus the area captured between these two critical values is 1 - \(a\). As a consequence of this and the theorem just stated,

\[P\left(\chi_{1-\alpha/2,n-1}^{2}<\frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}<\chi_{\alpha/2,n -1}^{2}\right)=1-\alpha \tag{8.17}\]

The inequalities in (8.17) are equivalent to

\[\frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\chi_{2/2,n-1}^{2}}<\sigma^{2}<\frac{(n-1)S^{2}}{\chi_{1- \alpha/2,n-1}^{2}}\]

Substituting the computed value \(s\)2 into the limits gives a CI for \(s\)2, and taking square roots gives an interval for \(s\)2.

A **100(1 - _a_)% confidence interval for the variance \(s\)2 of a normal population has lower limit

\[(n-1)s^{2}/\chi_{\alpha/2,n-1}^{2}\]

and upper limit

\[(n-1)s^{2}/\chi_{1-\alpha/2,n-1}^{2}\]

A **confidence interval for _s_** has lower and upper limits that are the square roots of the corresponding limits in the interval for \(s\)2.

Recall the beer alcohol percentage data from Example 8.11, where the normal plot was acceptably straight and the standard deviation was found to be \(s\) =.8483. Then the sample variance is \(s\)2 =.84832 =.7196, and we wish to estimate the population variance \(s\)2. With df = \(n\) - 1 = 15, a 95% confidence interval requires _kh_2/2 = 6.262 and _kh_2/2 = 27.488. The interval for \(s\)2 is

\[\left(\frac{15(.7196)}{27.488},\ \frac{15(.7196)}{6.262}\right)=(.393,1.724)\]

Taking the square root of each endpoint yields (.627, 1.313) as the 95% confidence interval for \(s\). With lower and upper limits differing by more than a factor of two, this interval is quite wide. Precise estimates of variability require large samples.

Unfortunately, our confidence interval requires that the data be normal or nearly normal. In the case of nonnormal data the interval could be very far from valid; for example, the true confidence level could be 70% where 95% is intended. See Exercise 57 in the next section for a method that does not require the normal distribution.

* [44] Determine the values of the following quantities:
* Determine the following:
* The 95th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with \(v=10\)
* The 5th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with \(v=10\)
* \(P(10.98\leq\chi^{2}\leq 36.78)\), where \(\chi^{2}\) is a chi-squared rv with \(v=22\)
* \(P(\chi^{2}<14.611\) or \(\chi^{2}>37.652)\), where \(\chi^{2}\) is a chi-squared rv with \(v=25\)
* Exercise 34 gave a random sample of 20 ACT scores from students taking college freshman calculus. Calculate a 99% CI for the standard deviation of the population distribution. Is this interval valid whatever the nature of the distribution? Explain.

## 8 Bootstrap Confidence Intervals

How can we find a confidence interval for the mean if the population distribution is not normal and the sample size \(n\) is not large? Can we find confidence intervals for other parameters such as the population median or the 90th percentile of the population distribution? The bootstrap, developed by Bradley Efron in the late 1970s, allows us to calculate estimates in situations where statistical theory does not produce a formula for a confidence interval. The method substitutes heavy computation for theory, and it has been feasible only fairly recently with the availability of fast computers. The bootstrap was introduced in Section 7.1 for applications with known distribution (the _parametric bootstrap_), but here we are concerned with the case of unknown distribution (the _nonparametric bootstrap_).

In a student project, Erich Brandt studied tips at a restaurant. Here is a random sample of 30 observed tip percentages:

\[\begin{array}{llll}22.7,&16.3,&13.6,&16.8,&29.9,&15.9,&14.0,&15.0,&14.1,&18.1,&22.8,&27.6,&16.4,&16.1,&19.0,\\ 13.5,&18.9,&20.2,&19.7,&18.2,&15.4,&15.7,&19.0,&11.5,&18.4,&16.0,&16.9,&12.0,&40.1,&19.2 \end{array}\]

We would like to get a confidence interval for the population mean tip percentage at this restaurant. However, this is not a large sample and there is a problem with positive skewness, as shown in the normal probability plot of Figure 8.10.

Most of the tips are between 10% and 20%, but a few big tips cause enough skewness to invalidate the normality assumption. The sample mean is 18.43% and the sample standard deviation is 5.76%.

If population normality were plausible, then we could form a confidence interval using the mean and standard deviation calculated from the sample. From Section 8.3, the resulting 95% confidence interval for the population mean would be

\[\overline{x}\pm t_{.025,n-1}\,\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}=18.43\pm 2.045\,\frac{5.76}{ \sqrt{30}}=18.43\pm 2.15=(16.3,\,20.6)\]

How does the bootstrap approach differ from this? For the moment, we regard the 30 observations as constituting a population, and take a large number of random samples (999 is a common choice), each of size 30, from this population. These are samples with replacement, so repetitions are allowed. For each of these samples we compute the mean (or the median or whatever statistic estimates the population parameter). Then we use the distribution of these 999 means to get a confidence interval for the population mean. To help get a feeling for how this works, here is the first of the 999 samples:

\(22.8\), \(16.8\), \(16.0\), \(19.0\), \(19.2\), \(20.2\), \(13.6\), \(15.9\), \(22.8\), \(11.5\), \(15.9\), \(14.0\), \(29.9\), \(19.2\), \(16.0\), \(27.6\), \(14.1\), \(13.5\), \(16.8\), \(15.4\), \(20.2\), \(16.4\), \(20.2\), \(16.9\), \(16.8\), \(22.8\), \(19.7\), \(18.2\), \(22.7\), \(18.2\)

This sample has mean \(\overline{x}_{1}^{*}=18.41\), where the asterisk emphasizes that this is the mean of a bootstrap sample.

Of course, when we take a random sample with replacement, repetitions usually occur as they do here, and this implies that not all of the 30 observations will appear in each sample. After doing this 998 more times and computing the means \(\overline{x}_{2}^{*},...,\overline{x}_{999}^{*}\) for these 999 samples, we construct Figure 8.11, the histogram of the 999 \(\overline{x}^{*}\) values.

Figure 8.10: Normal probability plot from MINITAB of the tip percentages

This describes approximately the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\) for samples of 30 from the true tip population. That is, if we could draw the pdf for the true population distribution of \(\overline{x}\) values, then it should look something like the histogram in Figure 8.11. Does the distribution appear to be normal? The histogram is not exactly symmetric, and the distribution looks skewed to the right. Figure 8.12 has the normal probability plot from MINITAB:

The pattern in this plot gives evidence of slight positive skewness (see Section 4.6). If this plot were straighter, then we could form a 95% confidence interval for the population mean in the following way. Let \(s_{\text{boot}}\) denote the sample standard deviation of the 999 bootstrap means. That is, defining \(\overline{x}^{*}\) to be the mean of the 999 bootstrap means,

\[s_{\text{boot}}^{2}=\frac{\sum\left(\overline{x}_{i}^{*}-\overline{x}^{*} \right)^{2}}{999-1}\]

Figure 8.11: Histogram of the tip bootstrap distribution, from MINITAB

Figure 8.12: Normal plot of the tip bootstrap distribution

The value of \(s_{\text{boot}}\) turns out to be 1.043. The sample mean of the original 30 tip percentages is \(\overline{x}=18.43\), giving the 95% confidence interval

\[\overline{x}\pm z_{.025}s_{\text{boot}}=18.43\pm 1.96(1.043)=18.43\pm 2.04=(16.4,\,20.5)\]

Notice that this is very similar to the previous interval based on the method of Section 8.3. The difference is mainly due to using the \(z\) critical value instead of the \(t\) critical value, because the bootstrap standard deviation \(s_{\text{boot}}=1.043\) is close to the estimated standard error \(s/\sqrt{n}=1.052\). There should be good agreement if the original data set looks normal. Even if the normality assumption is not satisfied, there should be good agreement if the sample size \(n\) is big enough. 

## The Percentile Interval

In the case that the bootstrap distribution (as represented here by the histogram of Figure 8.11) is normal, the foregoing interval uses the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution. Because the 999 bootstrap means do not fit a normal curve, we need an alternative approach to finding a confidence interval. To allow for a nonnormal bootstrap distribution, we need to use something other than the standard deviation and the \(t\) table to determine the confidence limits. The _percentile interval_ uses the 2.5 percentile and the 97.5 percentile of the bootstrap distribution for confidence limits of a 95% confidence interval. Computationally, one way to find the two percentiles is to sort the 999 means and then use the 25th value from each end.

For the tip data the 2.5 percentile is 16.7 and the 97.5 percentile is 20.8, so the 95% bootstrap percentile interval (16.65, 20.80). Because the bootstrap distribution is positively skewed, the percentile interval is shifted slightly to the right compared to the interval based on a normal bootstrap distribution. 

## A Refined Interval

When the percentile method is used to obtain a confidence interval, under some circumstances the actual confidence level may differ substantially from the nominal level (the level you think you are getting); in our example, the nominal level was 95%, and the actual level could be quite different from this. There are refined bootstrap intervals that often yield an improvement in this respect. In particular,the BCa (bias corrected and accelerated) interval, implemented in the R, Stata, and Systat software packages, is a method that corrects for bias. Here bias refers to the difference between the mean of the bootstrap distribution compared to the value of the estimate based on the original sample. For example, in estimating the mean for the tip data, the mean of the 30 tips in the original sample is 18.43 but the mean of the 999 bootstrap sample means is 18.46, so there is just a slight bias of 18.46 \(-\) 18.43 \(=\).03.

The acceleration aspect of the BCa interval is an adjustment for dependence of the standard error of the estimator on the parameter that is being estimated. For example, suppose we are trying to estimate the mean in the case of exponential data. In this case the standard deviation is equal to the mean, and the standard error of \(\overline{X}\) is \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}=\mu/\sqrt{n}\), so the standard error of the estimator \(\overline{X}\) depends strongly on the parameter \(\mu\) that is being estimated. If the histogram in Figure 8.11 resembled the exponential pdf, we would expect the BCa method to make a substantial correction to the percentile interval.

Recall that the percentile interval for the mean of the tip data is (16.7, 20.8). Compared to this, the BCa interval (16.9, 21.8) is shifted a little to the right.

Is the bootstrap guaranteed to work, or is it possible that the method can give grossly incorrect estimates? The key here is how closely the original sample represents the whole distribution of the random variable \(X\). When the sample is small, then there is a possibility that important features of the distribution are not included in the data set. In terms of our 30 observations, the value 40.1% is highly influential. If we drew another sample of 30 observations independent of this sample, the luck of the draw might give no values above 25, and the sample would yield very different conclusions. The bootstrap is a useful method for making inferences from data, but it is dependent on a good sample. If this is all the data that we can get, we will never know how well our sample represents the distribution, and therefore how good our answer is. Of course, no statistical method will give good answers if the sample is not representative of the population.

## Bootstrapping the Median

We do have a statistic that is less sensitive to the influence of individual observations. For the 30 tip percentages, the median is 16.85, substantially less than the mean of 18.43. The mean is pulled upward by the few large values, but these extremes have little effect on the median. In general, the median is less affected by outliers than the mean. However, it is more difficult to get confidence intervals for the median. There is a nice statistic to estimate the standard deviation of the mean \((S/\sqrt{n})\), but unfortunately there is nothing like this for the median.

Let's use the bootstrap method to get a confidence interval for the median of the tip data. We can use the same 999 samples of 30 as we did previously, but now we instead look at the 999 medians. The first sample has mean \(\overline{x}_{1}^{*}=18.41\), whereas its median is \(\tilde{x}_{1}^{*}=17.55\). The histogram of this and the other 998 bootstrap medians \(\tilde{x}_{2}^{*},\ldots,\tilde{x}_{999}^{*}\) is shown in Figure 8.13.

It should be apparent that the distribution of the 999 bootstrap medians is not normal. As is often the case with the median, the bootstrap distribution takes on just a few values and there are many repeats. Instead of 999 different values, as would be expected if we took 999 samples from a true continuous distribution, here there are only 72 values, and some appear more than 50 times. These are apparent in the normal probability plot, shown in Figure 8.14. In contrast to what MINITAB does, the values here are plotted vertically, so the horizontal segments indicate repeats.

The mean of the 999 bootstrap medians is 17.20 with standard deviation.917. Even though the procedure is inappropriate because of nonnormality, we can for comparative purposes use the median \(\tilde{x}=16.85\) of the original 30 observations

Figure 8.14: Normal probability plot of the bootstrap medians from R

Figure 8.13: Histogram of the bootstrap medians from R

together with the bootstrap standard deviation \(\tilde{s}_{\text{\it boot}}=.917\) to get a confidence interval based on the normal distribution:

\[\tilde{x}\pm z_{.025}\tilde{s}_{\text{\it boot}}=16.85\pm 1.96(.917)=16.85\pm 1.80 =(15.1,\,18.6)\]

Because the bootstrap distribution is so nonnormal, it is more appropriate to use the percentile interval in which the confidence limits for a 95% confidence interval are taken from the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the bootstrap distribution. When the 999 bootstrap medians are sorted, the 25th value is 15.94 and the 25th value from the top is 18.98, so the 95% confidence interval for the population median is (15.94, 18.98). In accord with the nonnormal bootstrap distribution, this interval differs from the interval that assumes normality.

The bias corrected and accelerated BCa refinement gives only a slight change to the percentile interval for the median. To estimate the bias, subtract the median of the original sample from the mean of the bootstrap medians, which is 17.20 \(-\) 16.85 =.35. The percentile interval gives only a slight refinement from (15.94, 18.98) to (15.87, 18.94). 

We should be a bit uncomfortable with the results of bootstrapping the median. Given that the bootstrap distribution takes on just a few values but the true sampling distribution is continuous, we should worry a little about how well the bootstrap distribution approximates the true sampling distribution. On the other hand, the situation here is nowhere near as bad as it could be. Sometimes, especially when the sample size is smaller, the bootstrap distribution has far fewer values.

What can be done to see if the bootstrap results are valid for the median? We performed a simulation experiment with data from the exponential distribution, a distribution that is more strongly skewed than the tip percentages. We generated 100 samples, each of size 30, and then took 999 bootstrap samples from each of them. In this way we obtained 95% percentile confidence intervals for the mean and the median from each of the 100 samples. We used the exponential distribution with mean \(\mu=1/\lambda=1\), for which the median \(\tilde{\mu}=\ln(2)=.693\). In checking each of the 100 confidence intervals for the mean, we found that 93 of them contained the true mean. Similarly, we found that 93 of the confidence intervals for the median contained the true median. It is gratifying to see that, in spite of the strange distribution of the bootstrapped medians, the performance of the percentile confidence intervals is reasonably on target.

## The Mean Versus the Median

For the tip percentages is it better to use the mean or the median? The median is much less affected by the extreme observations in this skewed data set. This suggests that the mean will vary a lot depending on whether a particular sample has outliers. Here, the variability shows up in a higher standard deviation 1.043 for the 999 bootstrap means as compared to the standard deviation.917 for the 999 bootstrap medians. Furthermore, the percentile interval with 95% confidence for the mean has width 4.15 whereas the interval for the median has a width of only 3.04. In terms of precision, we are better off with the median. For a prospective server at this restaurant, it might also be more meaningful to give the median, the middle tip value in the sense that roughly half are above and half are below.

Of course, it is not always necessary to choose one statistic over the other. Sometimes a case can be made for presenting both the mean and the median. In the case of salaries, the median salary may be more relevant to an employee, but the mean may be more useful to the employer because the mean is proportional to the total payroll.

## Supplementary Results

* According to the article "Fatigue Testing of Condoms" (_Polymer Testing_, 2009: 567-571), "tests currently used for condoms are surrogates for the challenges they face in use", including a test for holes, an inflation test, a package seal test, and tests of dimensions and lubricant quality (all fertile territory for the use of statistical methodology!). The investigators developed a new test that adds cyclic strain to a level well below breakage and determines the number of cycles to break. A sample of 20 condoms of one particular type resulted in a sample mean number of 1584 and a sample standard deviation of 607. Calculate and interpret a confidence interval at the 99% confidence level for the true average number of cycles to break. [_Note_: The article presented the results of hypothesis tests based on the \(t\) distribution; the validity of these depends on assuming normal population distributions.]

consists of \(n\) independent (\(x_{i}\), \(Y_{i}\)) pairs, where each \(Y_{i}\) is normally distributed with mean \(\beta x_{i}\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). The likelihood is then a product of normal pdf's with different mean values but the same variance. **a.**: Show that the mle of \(\beta\) is \(\hat{\beta}=\Sigma x_{i}Y_{i}/\Sigma x_{i}^{2}\). **b.**: Verify that the mle of (a) is unbiased. **c.**: Obtain an expression for \(V(\hat{\beta})\) and then for \(\sigma_{\hat{\beta}}\). **d.**: For purposes of obtaining a precise estimate of \(\beta\), is it better to have the \(x_{i}\)'s all close to 0 (the origin) or quite far from 0? Explain your reasoning. **e.**: The natural prediction of \(Y_{i}\) is \(\hat{\beta}x_{i}\). Let \(S^{2}=\Sigma(Y_{i}-\hat{\beta}x_{i})^{2}/(n-1)\) which is analogous to our earlier sample variance \(S^{2}=\Sigma(X_{i}-\overline{X})^{2}/(n-1)\) for a univariate sample \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) (in which case \(\overline{X}\) is a natural prediction for each \(X_{i}\)). Then it can be shown that \(T=(\hat{\beta}-\beta)/\big{(}S/\sqrt{\Sigma x_{i}^{2}}\big{)}\) has a \(t\) distribution based on \(n-1\) df. Use this to obtain a CI formula for estimating \(\beta\), and calculate a 95% CI using the data from the cited exercise.
**70.**: Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a uniform distribution on the interval [0, \(\theta\)], so that

\[f(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{\theta}&0\leq x\leq\theta\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

Then if \(Y=\max(X_{i})\), by the first proposition in Section 5.5, \(U=Y/\theta\) has density function

\[f_{U}(u)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}nu^{n-1}&0\leq u\leq 1\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]
**a.**: Use \(f_{U}(u)\) to verify that

\[P\bigg{[}(\alpha/2)^{1/n}\leq\frac{Y}{\theta}\leq(1-\alpha/2)^{1/n}\bigg{]}=1 -\alpha\]

and use this to derive a \(100(1-\alpha)\)% CI for \(\theta\). **b.**: Verify that \(P(\alpha^{1/n}\leq Y/\theta\leq 1)=1-\alpha\), and derive a \(100(1-\alpha)\)% CI for \(\theta\) based on this probability statement. **c.**: Which of the two intervals derived previously is shorter? If your waiting time for a morning bus is uniformly distributed and observed waiting times are \(x_{1}=4.2\), \(x_{2}=3.5\), \(x_{3}=1.7\), \(x_{4}=1.2\), and \(x_{5}=2.4\), derive a 95% CI for \(\theta\) by using the shorter of the two intervals.
**71.**: Let \(0<\gamma<\alpha\). Then a \(100(1-\alpha)\)% CI for \(\mu\) when \(n\) is large is

\[\bigg{(}\overline{x}-z_{\gamma}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}},\overline{x}+z_{\alpha- \gamma}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\bigg{)}\]

The choice \(\gamma=\alpha/2\) yields the usual interval derived in Section 8.2; if \(\gamma\neq\alpha/2\), this confidence interval is not symmetric about \(\overline{x}\). The width of the interval is \(w=s(z_{+}z_{-\gamma})/\sqrt{n}\). Show that \(w\) is minimized for the choice \(\gamma=\alpha/2\), so that the symmetric interval is the shortest. [_Hints_: (a) By definition of \(z_{\alpha}\), \(\Phi(z_{\alpha})=1-\alpha\), so that \(z_{\alpha}=\Phi^{-1}(1-\alpha)\); (b) the relationship between the derivative of a function \(y=f(x)\) and the inverse function \(x=f^{-1}(y)\) is \((d/dy)f^{-1}(y)=1df^{\prime}(x)\).]
**72.**: Suppose \(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\) are observed values resulting from a random sample from a symmetric but possibly heavy-tailed distribution. Let \(\tilde{x}\) and \(f_{s}\) denote the sample median and fourth spread, respectively. Chapter 11 of _Understanding Robust and Exploratory Data Analysis_ (see the bibliography in Chapter 7) suggests the following robust 95% CI for the population mean (point of symmetry):

\[\tilde{x}\pm\bigg{(}\frac{\text{conservative $t$ critical value}}{1.075}\bigg{)}\cdot\frac{f_{s}}{\sqrt{n}}\]

The value of the quantity in parentheses is 2.10 for \(n=10\), 1.94 for \(n=20\), and 1.91 for \(n=30\). Compute this CI for the restaurant tip data of Example 8.15, and compare to the \(t\) CI appropriate for a normal population distribution.
**73.**: **a.**: Use the results of Example 8.5 to obtain a 95% lower confidence bound for the parameter \(\lambda\) of an exponential distribution, and calculate the bound based on the data given in the example. **b.**: If lifetime \(X\) has an exponential distribution, the probability that lifetime exceeds \(t\) is given by \(P(X>t)=e^{-\lambda t}\). Use the result of part (a) to obtain a 95% lower confidence bound for the probability that lifetime exceeds 100 min.
**74.**: Let \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\) denote the mean weights for animals of two different species. An investigator wishes to estimate the ratio \(\theta_{1}\theta_{2}\). Unfortunately the species are extremely rare, so the estimate will be based on finding a single animal of each species. Let \(X_{i}\) denote the weight of the species \(i\) animal (\(i=1,2\)), assumed to be normally distributed with mean \(\theta_{i}\) and standard deviation 1. **a.**: What is the distribution of the variable \(h(X_{1},X_{2};\theta_{1},\theta_{2})=(\theta_{2}X_{1}-\theta_{1}X_{2})/\sqrt{ \theta_{1}^{2}+\theta_{2}^{2}}\)? Show that this variable depends on \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\) only through \(\theta_{1}/\theta_{2}\) (divide numerator and denominator by \(\theta_{2}\)). **b.**: Consider Expression (8.7) from the first section of this chapter with \(a=-1.96\) and \(b=1.96\). Now replace \(<\text{by}=\) and solve for \(\theta_{1}/\theta_{2}\). Then show that a confidence interval results if \(x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}\geq 1.96^{2}\), whereas if this inequality is not satisfied, the resulting _confidence set_ is the complement of an interval.
75. The one-sample CI for a normal mean and PI for a single observation from a normal distribution were both based on the _central t_ distribution. A CI for a particular percentile (e.g., the 1st percentile or the 95th percentile) of a normal population distribution is based on the _noncentral t_ distribution. A particular distribution of this type is specified by both df and the value of the noncentrality parameter \(\delta\) (\(\delta=0\) gives the central \(t\) distribution). The key result is that the variable \[T = \frac{\frac{\overline{N} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} - (z\text{ percentile})\sqrt{n}}{S/\sigma}\] has a noncentral \(t\) distribution with \(\text{df}=n-1\) and \(\delta=-(z\text{ percentile})\sqrt{n}\). Let \(t_{.025,v,\delta}\) and \(t_{.975,v,\delta}\) denote the critical values that capture upper-tail area.025 and lower-tail area.025, respectively, under the noncentral \(t\) curve with \(v\) df and noncentrality parameter \(\delta\) (when \(\delta=0\), \(t_{.975}=-t_{.025}\), since central \(t\) distributions are symmetric about 0). 1. Use the given information to obtain a formula for a 95% confidence interval for the (100_b_)th percentile of a normal population distribution. 2. For \(\delta=6.58\) and \(\text{df}=15\), \(t_{.975}\) and \(t_{.025}\) are (from MINITAB) 4.1690 and 10.9684, respectively. Use this information to obtain a 95% CI for the 5th percentile of the beer alcohol distribution considered in Example 8.11.
76. The one-sample \(t\) CI for \(\mu\) is also a confidence interval for the population median \(\bar{\mu}\) when the population distribution is normal. We now develop a CI for \(\bar{\mu}\) that is valid whatever the shape of the population distribution as long as it is continuous. Let \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\) be a random sample from the distribution and \(Y_{1}\),..., \(Y_{n}\) denote the corresponding order statistics (smallest observation, second smallest, and so on). 1. What is \(P(X_{1}<\bar{\mu})\)? What is \(P(\{X_{1}<\bar{\mu}\})\cap\{X_{2}<\bar{\mu}\})? 2. What is \(P(Y_{n}<\bar{\mu})\)? What is \(P(Y_{1}>\bar{\mu})\)? [_Hint_: What condition involving all of the \(X_{i}\)'s is equivalent to the largest being smaller than the population median? 3. What is \(P(Y_{1}<\bar{\mu}<Y_{n})\)? What does this imply about the confidence level associated with the CI (\(y_{1}\), \(y_{n}\)) for \(\bar{\mu}\)? 4. An experiment carried out to study the time (min) necessary for an anesthetic to produce the desired result yielded the following data: 31.2, 36.0, 31.5, 28.7, 37.2, 35.4, 33.3, 39.3, 42.0, 29.9. Determine the confidence interval of (c) and the associated confidence level. Also calculate the one-sample \(t\) CI using the same level and compare the two intervals.
77. Consider the situation described in the previous exercise. 1. What is \(P(\{X_{1}<\bar{\mu}\}\cap\{X_{2}>\bar{\mu}\}\cap\cdots\cap\{X_{n}>\bar{\mu}\})\), that is, the probability that only the first observation is smaller than the median? 2. What is the probability that exactly one of the \(n\) observations is smaller than the median? 3. What is \(P(\bar{\mu}<Y_{2})\)? [_Hint_: The event in parentheses occurs if all \(n\) of the observations exceed the median. How else can it occur? What does this imply about the confidence level associated with the CI (\(y_{2}\), \(y_{n-1}\)) for \(\bar{\mu}\)? Determine the confidence level and CI for the data given in the previous exercise.]
78. The previous two exercises considered a CI for a population median \(\bar{\mu}\) based on the \(n\) order statistics from a random sample. Let's now consider a prediction interval for the next observation \(X_{n+1}\). 1. What is \(P(X_{n+1}<X_{1})\)? What is \(P(\{X_{n+1}<X_{1}\}\cap\{X_{n+1}<X_{2}\})\)? 2. What is \(P(X_{n+1}<Y_{1})\)? What is \(P(X_{n+1}>Y_{n})\)? 3. What is \(P(Y_{1}<X_{n+1}<Y_{n})\)? What does this say about the prediction level for the PI (\(y_{1}\), \(y_{n}\))?

## Chapter 9 Hypotheses Based on a Single Sample

### 9.1 Hypotheses and Test Procedures

A **statistical hypothesis**, or just _hypothesis_, is a claim or assertion either about the value of a single parameter (population characteristic or characteristic of a probability distribution), about the values of several parameters, or about the form of an entire probability distribution. One example of a hypothesis is the claim \(\mu=\$311\), where \(\mu\) is the true average one-term textbook expenditure for students at a university. Another example is the statement \(p<.50\), where \(p\) is the proportion of adults who approve of the job that the President is doing. If \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) denote the true average decreases in systolic blood pressure for two different drugs, one hypothesis is the assertion that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\), and another is the statement \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>5\). Yet another example of a hypothesis is the assertion that the stopping distance for a car under particular conditions has a normal distribution. Hypotheses of this latter sort will be considered in Chapter 13. In this and the next several chapters, we concentrate on hypotheses about parameters.

In any hypothesis-testing problem, there are two contradictory hypotheses under consideration. One hypothesis might be the claim \(\mu=\$311\) and the other \(\mu\neq\$311\), or the two contradictory statements might be \(p\geq.50\) and \(p<.50\). The objective is to decide, based on sample information, which of the two hypotheses is correct. There is a familiar analogy to this in a criminal trial. One claim is the assertion that the accused individual is innocent. In the U.S. judicial system, this is the claim that is initially believed to be true. Only in the face of strong evidence to the contrary should the jury reject this claim in favor of the alternative assertion that the accused is guilty. In this sense, the claim of innocence is the favored or protected hypothesis, and the burden of proof is placed on those who believe in the alternative claim.

Similarly, in testing statistical hypotheses, the problem will be formulated so that one of the claims is initially favored. This initially favored claim will not be rejected in favor of the alternative claim unless sample evidence contradicts it and provides strong support for the alternative assertion.

\begin{tabular}{c c} DEFINITION & The **null hypothesis**, denoted by \(H_{0}\), is the claim that is initially assumed to be true (the "prior belief" claim). The **alternative hypothesis**, denoted by \(H_{\text{a}}\), is the assertion that is contradictory to \(H_{0}\). \\ \end{tabular}

The null hypothesis will be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis only if sample evidence suggests that \(H_{0}\) is false. If the sample does not strongly contradict \(H_{0}\), we will continue to believe in the plausibility of the null hypothesis. The two possible conclusions from a hypothesis-testing analysis are then _reject_\(H_{0}\) or _fail to reject_\(H_{0}\).

A **test of hypotheses** is a method for using sample data to decide whether the null hypothesis should be rejected. Thus we might test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=.75\) against the alternative \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq.75\). Only if sample data strongly suggests that \(\mu\) is something other than.75 should the null hypothesis be rejected. In the absence of such evidence, \(H_{0}\) should not be rejected, since it is still quite plausible.

Sometimes an investigator does not want to accept a particular assertion unless and until data can provide strong support for the assertion. As an example, suppose a company is considering putting a new additive in the dried fruit that it produces.

The true average shelf life with the current additive is known to be 200 days. With \(\mu\) denoting the true average life for the new additive, the company would not want to make a change unless evidence strongly suggested that \(\mu\) exceeds 200. An appropriate problem formulation would involve testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=200\) against \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>200\). The conclusion that a change is justified is identified with \(H_{\text{a}}\), and it would take conclusive evidence to justify rejecting \(H_{0}\) and switching to the new additive.

Scientific research often involves trying to decide whether a current theory should be replaced by a more plausible and satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon under investigation. A conservative approach is to identify the current theory with \(H_{0}\) and the researcher's alternative explanation with \(H_{\text{a}}\). Rejection of the current theory will then occur only when evidence is much more consistent with the new theory. In many situations, \(H_{\text{a}}\) is referred to as the "research hypothesis," since it is the claim that the researcher would really like to validate. The word _null_ means "of no value, effect, or consequence," which suggests that \(H_{0}\) should be identified with the hypothesis of no change (from current opinion), no difference, no improvement, and so on. Suppose, for example, that 10% of all computer circuit boards produced by a manufacturer during a recent period were defective. An engineer has suggested a change in the production process in the belief that it will result in a reduced defective rate. Let \(p\) denote the true proportion of defective boards resulting from the changed process. Then the research hypothesis, on which the burden of proof is placed, is the assertion that \(p<.10\). Thus the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\).

In our treatment of hypothesis testing, \(H_{0}\) will generally be stated as an equality claim. If \(\theta\) denotes the parameter of interest, the null hypothesis will have the form \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=\theta_{0}\), where \(\theta_{0}\) is a specified number called the _null value_ of the parameter (value claimed for \(\theta\) by the null hypothesis). As an example, consider the circuit board situation just discussed. The suggested alternative hypothesis was \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\), the claim that the defective rate is reduced by the process modification. A natural choice of \(H_{0}\) in this situation is the claim that \(p\geq.10\), according to which the new process is either no better _or_ worse than the one currently used. We will instead consider \(H_{0}\): \(p=.10\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\). The rationale for using this simplified null hypothesis is that any reasonable decision procedure for deciding between \(H_{0}\): \(p=.10\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\) will also be reasonable for deciding between the claim that \(p\geq.10\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\). The use of a simplified \(H_{0}\) is preferred because it has certain technical benefits, which will be apparent shortly.

The alternative to the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=\theta_{0}\) will look like one of the following three assertions:

**1.**: \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta>\theta_{0}\) (in which case the implicit null hypothesis is \(\theta\leq\theta_{0}\))
**2.**: \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta<\theta_{0}\) (so the implicit null hypothesis states that \(\theta\geq\theta_{0}\))
**3.**: \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta\neq\theta_{0}\).

For example, let \(\sigma\) denote the standard deviation of the distribution of outside diameters (inches) for an engine piston. If the decision was made to use the piston unless sample evidence conclusively demonstrated that \(\sigma>.0001\) in., the appropriate hypotheses would be \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma=.0001\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\sigma>.0001\). The number \(\theta_{0}\) that appears in both \(H_{0}\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\) (separates the alternative from the null) is called the **null value**.

## Test Procedures

A test procedure is a rule, based on sample data, for deciding whether to reject \(H_{0}\). A test of \(H_{0}\): \(p=.10\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\) in the circuit board problem might be based on examining a random sample of \(n=200\) boards. Let \(X\) denote the number of defective boards in the sample, a binomial random variable; \(x\) represents the observed value of \(X\). If \(H_{0}\) is true, \(E(X)=np=200(.10)=20\), whereas we can expect fewer than 20 defective boards if \(H_{\text{a}}\) is true. A value \(x\) just a bit below 20 does not strongly contradict \(H_{0}\), so it is reasonable to reject \(H_{0}\) only if \(x\) is substantially \(<\) 20. One such test procedure is to reject \(H_{0}\) if \(x\leq 15\) and not reject \(H_{0}\) otherwise. This procedure has two constituents: (1) a _test statistic_ or function of the sample data used to make a decision and (2) a _rejection region_ consisting of those \(x\) values for which \(H_{0}\) will be rejected in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\). For the rule just suggested, the rejection region consists of \(x=0\), 1, 2,..., 15. \(H_{0}\) will not be rejected if \(x=16\), 17,..., 199, or 200.

A test procedure is specified by the following:

**1.**: A **test statistic**, a function of the sample data on which the decision (reject \(H_{0}\) or do not reject \(H_{0}\)) is to be based
**2.**: A **rejection region**, the set of all test statistic values for which \(H_{0}\) will be rejected

The null hypothesis will then be rejected if and only if the observed or computed test statistic value falls in the rejection region.

As another example, suppose a cigarette manufacturer claims that the average nicotine content \(\mu\) of brand B cigarettes is (at most) 1.5 mg. It would be unwise to reject the manufacturer's claim without strong contradictory evidence, so an appropriate problem formulation is to test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=1.5\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>1.5\). Consider a decision rule based on analyzing a random sample of 32 cigarettes. Let \(\overline{X}\) denote the sample average nicotine content. If \(H_{0}\) is true, \(E(\overline{X})=\mu=1.5\), whereas if \(H_{0}\) is false, we expect \(\overline{X}\) to exceed 1.5. Strong evidence against \(H_{0}\) is provided by a value \(\overline{x}\) that considerably exceeds 1.5. Thus we might use \(\overline{X}\) as a test statistic along with the rejection region \(\overline{x}\geq 1.60\).

In both the circuit board and nicotine examples, the choice of test statistic and form of the rejection region make sense intuitively. However, the choice of cutoff value used to specify the rejection region is somewhat arbitrary. Instead of rejecting \(H_{0}\): \(p=.10\) in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\) when \(x\leq 15\), we could use the rejection region \(x\leq 14\). For this region, \(H_{0}\) would not be rejected if 15 defective boards are observed, whereas this occurrence would lead to rejection of \(H_{0}\) if the initially suggested region is employed. Similarly, the rejection region \(\overline{x}\geq 1.55\) might be used in the nicotine problem in place of the region \(\overline{x}\geq 1.60\).

## Errors in Hypothesis Testing

The basis for choosing a particular rejection region lies in an understanding of the errors that one might be faced with in drawing a conclusion. Consider the rejection region \(x\leq 15\) in the circuit board problem. Even when \(H_{0}\): \(p=.10\) is true, it might happen that an unusual sample results in \(x=13\), so that \(H_{0}\) is erroneously rejected. On the other hand, even when \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.10\) is true,an unusual sample might yield \(x=20\), in which case \(H_{0}\) would not be rejected, again an incorrect conclusion. Thus it is possible that \(H_{0}\) may be rejected when it is true or that \(H_{0}\) may not be rejected when it is false. These possible errors are not consequences of a foolishly chosen rejection region. Either one of these two errors might result when the region \(x\leq 14\) is employed, or indeed when any other sensible region is used.

### Definition

A **type I error** consists of rejecting the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\) when it is true.

A **type II error** involves not rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(H_{0}\) is false.

In the nicotine scenario, a type I error consists of rejecting the manufacturer's claim that \(\mu=1.5\) when it is actually true. If the rejection region \(\overline{x}\geq 1.60\) is employed, it might happen that \(\overline{x}=1.63\) even when \(\mu=1.5\), resulting in a type I error. Alternatively, it may be that \(H_{0}\) is false and yet \(\overline{x}=1.52\) is observed, leading to \(H_{0}\) not being rejected (a type II error).

In the best of all possible worlds, test procedures for which neither type of error is possible could be developed. However, this ideal can be achieved only by basing a decision on an examination of the entire population, which is almost always impractical. The difficulty with using a procedure based on sample data is that because of sampling variability, an unrepresentative sample may result. Even though \(E(\overline{X})=\mu\), the observed value \(\overline{x}\) may differ substantially from \(\mu\) (at least if \(n\) is small). Thus when \(\mu=1.5\) in the nicotine situation, \(\overline{x}\) may be much larger than 1.5, resulting in erroneous rejection of \(H_{0}\). Alternatively, it may be that \(\mu=1.6\) yet an \(\overline{x}\) much smaller than this is observed, leading to a type II error.

Instead of demanding error-free procedures, we must look for procedures for which either type of error is unlikely to occur. That is, a good procedure is one for which the probability of making either type of error is small. The choice of a particular rejection region cutoff value fixes the probabilities of type I and type II errors. These error probabilities are traditionally denoted by \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), respectively. Because \(H_{0}\) specifies a unique value of the parameter, there is a single value of \(\alpha\). However, there is a different value of \(\beta\) for each value of the parameter consistent with \(H_{\alpha}\).

An automobile model is known to sustain no visible damage 25% of the time in 10-mph crash tests. A modified bumper design has been proposed in an effort to increase this percentage. Let \(p\) denote the proportion of all 10-mph crashes with this new bumper that result in no visible damage. The hypotheses to be tested are \(H_{0}\): \(p=.25\) (no improvement) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): \(p>.25\). The test will be based on an experiment involving \(n=20\) independent crashes with prototypes of the new design. Intuitively, \(H_{0}\) should be rejected if a substantial number of the crashes show no damage. Consider the following test procedure:

\[\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{Test statistic:}&X=\mbox{the number of crashes with no visible damage}\\ \mbox{Rejection region:}&R_{8}=\{8,9,10,\ldots,19,20\}\mbox{; that is, reject $H_{0}$ if $x\geq 8$,}\\ &\mbox{where $x$ is the observed value of the test statistic}\\ \end{array}\]

This rejection region is called _upper-tailed_ because it consists only of large values of the test statistic.

When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(X\) has a binomial probability distribution with \(n=20\) and \(p=.25\). Then

\[\alpha = \text{ P(type I error)}=P(H_{0}\text{ is rejected when it is true)}\] \[= P[X\geq 8\ when\ X\sim Bin(20,\.25)]=1-B(7;\ 20,\.25)\] \[= 1-.898=.102\]

That is, when \(H_{0}\) is actually true, roughly 10% of all experiments consisting of 20 crashes would result in \(H_{0}\) being incorrectly rejected (a type I error).

In contrast to \(\alpha\), there is not a single \(\beta\). Instead, there is a different \(\beta\) for each different \(p\) that exceeds.25. Thus there is a value of \(\beta\) for \(p=.3\) [in which case \(X\sim\text{Bin(20,\.3)}\)], another value of \(\beta\) for \(p=.5\), and so on. For example,

\[\beta(.3) = P(\text{type II error when }p=.3)\] \[= P(H_{0}\text{ is not rejected when it is false because }p=.3)\] \[= P[X\leq 7\text{ when }X\sim\text{Bin(20,\.3)}]=B(7;\ 20,\.3)=.772\]

When \(p\) is actually.3 rather than.25 (a "small" departure from \(H_{0}\)), roughly 77% of all experiments of this type would result in \(H_{0}\) being incorrectly not rejected!

The accompanying table displays \(\beta\) for selected values of \(p\) (each calculated for the rejection region \(R_{8}\)). Clearly, \(\beta\) decreases as the value of \(p\) moves farther to the right of the null value.25. Intuitively, the greater the departure from \(H_{0}\), the more likely it is that such a departure will be detected.

\[\beta(p) \cdot.772\cdot.416\cdot.132\cdot.021\cdot.001\cdot.000\]

The proposed test procedure is still reasonable for testing the more realistic null hypothesis that \(p\leq.25\). In this case, there is no longer a single \(\alpha\), but instead there is an \(\alpha\) for each \(p\) that is at most.25: \(\alpha(.25)\), \(\alpha(.23)\), \(\alpha(.20)\), \(\alpha(.15)\), and so on. It is easily verified, though, that \(\alpha(p)<\alpha(.25)=.102\) if \(p<.25\). That is, the largest value of \(\alpha\) occurs for the boundary value.25 between \(H_{0}\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\). Thus if \(\alpha\) is small for the simplified null hypothesis, it will also be as small as or smaller for the more realistic \(H_{0}\). 

The drying time of a type of paint under specified test conditions is known to be normally distributed with mean value 75 min and standard deviation 9 min. Chemists have proposed a new additive designed to decrease average drying time. It is believed that drying times with this additive will remain normally distributed with \(\sigma=9\). Because of the expense associated with the additive, evidence should strongly suggest an improvement in average drying time before such a conclusion is adopted. Let \(\mu\) denote the true average drying time when the additive is used. The appropriate hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=75\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu<75\). Only if \(H_{0}\) can be rejected will the additive be declared successful and used.

Experimental data is to consist of drying times from \(n=25\) test specimens. Let \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{25}\) denote the 25 drying times--a random sample of size 25 from a normal distribution with mean value \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma=9\). The sample mean drying time \(\overline{X}\) then has a normal distribution with expected value \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}=9/\sqrt{25}=1.80\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=75\), so only an \(\overline{x}\) value substantially \(<75\) would strongly contradict \(H_{0}\). A reasonable rejection region has the form \(\uppi\leq c\), where the cutoff value \(c\) is suitably chosen. Consider the choice \(c=70.8\), so that the test procedure consists of test statistic \(\overline{X}\) and rejection region \(\uppi\leq 70.8\). Because the rejection region consists only of small values of the test statistic, the test is said to be _lower-tailed_. Calculation of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) now involves a routine standardization of \(\overline{X}\) followed by reference to the standard normal probabilities of Appendix Table A.3:

\[\begin{array}{l}\alpha=P(\mbox{type I error})=P(H_{0}\mbox{ is rejected when it is true})\\ \quad=P(\overline{X}\leq 70.8\mbox{ when }\overline{X}\sim\mbox{normal with }\mu_{\overline{X}}=75,\sigma_{\overline{X}}=1.8)\\ \quad=\Phi\biggl{(}\frac{70.8-75}{1.8}\biggr{)}=\Phi(-2.33)=.01\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{l}\beta(72)=P(\mbox{type II error when }\mu=72)\\ \quad=P(H_{0}\mbox{ is not rejected when it is false because }\mu=72)\\ \quad=P(\overline{X}>70.8\mbox{ when }\overline{X}\sim\mbox{normal with }\mu_{\overline{X}}=72,\sigma_{\overline{X}}=1.8)\\ \quad=1-\Phi\biggl{(}\frac{70.8-72}{1.8}\biggr{)}=1-\Phi(-.67)=1-.2514=.7486\\ \beta(70)=1-\Phi\biggl{(}\frac{70.8-70}{1.8}\biggr{)}=.3300\quad\beta(67)=.0174 \end{array}\]

For the specified test procedure, only 1% of all experiments carried out as described will result in \(H_{0}\) being rejected when it is actually true. However, the chance of a type II error is very large when \(\mu=72\) (only a small departure from \(H_{0}\)), somewhat less when \(\mu=70\), and quite small when \(\mu=67\) (a very substantial departure from \(H_{0}\)). These error probabilities are illustrated in Figure 9.1 on the next page. Notice that \(\alpha\) is computed using the probability distribution of the test statistic when \(H_{0}\) is true, whereas determination of \(\beta\) requires knowing the test statistic's distribution when \(H_{0}\) is false.

As in Example 9.1, if the more realistic null hypothesis \(\mu\geq 75\) is considered, there is an \(\alpha\) for each parameter value for which \(H_{0}\) is true: \(\alpha(75)\), \(\alpha(75.8)\), \(\alpha(76.5)\), and so on. It is easily verified, though, that \(\alpha(75)\) is the largest of all these type I error probabilities. Focusing on the boundary value amounts to working explicitly with the "worst case."

The specification of a cutoff value for the rejection region in the examples just considered was somewhat arbitrary. Use of the rejection region \(R_{8}=\{8,9,\ldots,20\}\) in Example 9.1 resulted in \(\alpha=.102\), \(\beta(.3)=.772\), and \(\beta(.5)=.132\). Many would think these error probabilities intolerably large. Perhaps they can be decreased by changing the cutoff value.

Let us use the same experiment and test statistic \(X\) as previously described in the automobile bumper problem but now consider the rejection region \(R_{9}=\{9,10,\ldots,20\}\). Since \(X\) still has a binomial distribution with parameters \(n=20\) and \(p\),

\[\begin{array}{l}\alpha=P(H_{0}\mbox{ is rejected when }p=.25)\\ \quad=P[X\geq 9\mbox{ when }X\sim\mbox{Bin}(20,.25)]=1-B(8;\ 20,\.25)=.041\end{array}\]The type I error probability has been decreased by using the new rejection region. However, a price has been paid for this decrease:

\[\beta(.3) =P(H_{0}\text{ is not rejected when }p=.3)\] \[=P[X\leq 8\text{ when }X\sim\text{Bin}(20,\.3)]=B(8;\ 20,\.3)=.887\] \[\beta(.5) =B(8;\ 20,\.5)=.252\]

Both these \(\mathbf{\beta}\)'s are larger than the corresponding error probabilities.772 and.132 for the region \(R_{8}\). In retrospect, this is not surprising; \(\alpha\) is computed by summing over probabilities of test statistic values _in the rejection region_, whereas \(\beta\) is the probability that \(X\) falls _in the complement_ of the rejection region. Making the rejection region smaller must therefore decrease \(\alpha\) while increasing \(\beta\) for any fixed alternative value of the parameter. 

The use of cutoff value \(c=70.8\) in the paint-drying example resulted in a very small value of \(\alpha\) (.01) but rather large \(\beta\)'s. Consider the same experiment and test statistic \(\overline{X}\) with the new rejection region \(\overline{x}\leq 72\). Because \(\overline{X}\) is still normally distributed with mean value \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=1.8\),\[\alpha =P(H_{0}\text{ is rejected when it is true})\] \[=P[\overline{X} \leq 72\text{ when }\overline{X} \sim N(75,1.8^{2})]\] \[=\Phi\left(\frac{72-75}{1.8}\right) =\Phi(-1.67) =.0475 \approx.05\]

\[\beta(72) =P(H_{0}\text{ is not rejected when }\mu =72)\] \[=P(\overline{X} > 72\text{ when }\overline{X}\text{ is a normal rv with mean }72\text{ and standard deviation }1.8)\] \[=1-\Phi\left(\frac{72-72}{1.8}\right) =1-\Phi(0) =.5\] \[\beta(70) =1-\Phi\left(\frac{72-70}{1.8}\right) =.1335\quad\beta(67) =.0027\]

The change in cutoff value has made the rejection region larger (it includes more \(x\) values), resulting in a decrease in \(\beta\) for each fixed \(\mu\) less than 75. However, \(a\) for this new region has increased from the previous value.01 to approximately.05. If a type I error probability this large can be tolerated, though, the second region (_c_ = 72) is preferable to the first (_c_ = 70.8) because of the smaller _b_'s.

The results of these examples can be generalized in the following manner.

Suppose an experiment and a sample size are fixed and a test statistic is chosen. Then decreasing the size of the rejection region to obtain a smaller value of \(a\) results in a larger value of \(b\) for any particular parameter value consistent with _H_a.

This proposition says that once the test statistic and \(n\) are fixed, there is no rejection region that will simultaneously make both \(a\) and all _b_'s small. A region must be chosen to effect a compromise between \(a\) and \(b\).

Because of the suggested guidelines for specifying \(H\)0 and _H_a, a type I error is usually more serious than a type II error (this can always be achieved by proper choice of the hypotheses). The approach adhered to by most statistical practitioners is then to specify the largest value of \(a\) that can be tolerated and find a rejection region having that value of \(a\) rather than anything smaller. This makes \(b\) as small as possible subject to the bound on \(a\). The resulting value of \(a\) is often referred to as the **significance level** of the test. Traditional levels of significance are.10,.05, and.01, although the level in any particular problem will depend on the seriousness of a type I error--the more serious this error, the smaller should be the significance level. The corresponding test procedure is called a **level \(a\) test (e.g., a level.05 test or a level.01 test). A test with significance level \(a\) is one for which the type I error probability is controlled at the specified level.

Consider the situation mentioned previously in which \(m\) was the true average nicotine content of brand B cigarettes. The objective is to test \(H\)0: \(m\) = 1.5 versus _H_a: \(m\) > 1.5 based on a random sample \(X\)1, \(X\)2,..., \(X\)32 of nicotine contents. Suppose the distribution of nicotine content is known to be normal with \(s\) =.20. It follows that \(\overline{X}\) is normally distributed with mean value \(\mu_{\overline{X}} = \mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\overline{X}} =.20/\sqrt{32} =.0354\).

Rather than use \(\overline{X}\) itself as the test statistic, let's standardize \(\overline{X}\) assuming that \(H_{0}\) is true.

\[\text{Test statistic}:Z=\frac{\overline{X}-1.5}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{\overline {X}-1.5}{.0354}\]

\(Z\) expresses the distance between \(\overline{X}\) and its expected value when \(H_{0}\) is true as some number of standard deviations. For example, \(z=3\) results from an \(\overline{x}\) that is 3 standard deviations larger than we would have expected it to be were \(H_{0}\) true.

Rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(\overline{x}\) "considerably" exceeds 1.5 is equivalent to rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(z\) "considerably" exceeds 0. That is, the form of the rejection region is \(z\geq c\). Let's now determine \(c\) so that \(\alpha=.05\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(Z\) has a standard normal distribution. Thus

\[\alpha = P(\text{type I error})=\text{P(rejecting }H_{0}\text{ when it is true})\] \[= P[Z\geq c\text{ when }Z\sim N(0,1)]\]

The value \(c\) must capture upper-tail area.05 under the \(z\) curve. Either from Section 4.3 or directly from Appendix Table A.3, \(c=z_{.05}=1.645\).

Notice that \(z\geq 1.645\) is equivalent to \(\overline{x}-1.5\geq(.0354)(1.645)\); that is, \(\overline{x}\geq 1.56\). Then \(\beta\) is the probability that \(\overline{X}<1.56\) and can be calculated for any \(\mu>\)1.5.

A manufacturer of 40-amp fuses wants to make sure that the mean amperage at which its fuses burn out is in fact 40. If the mean amperage is lower than 40, customers will complain because the fuses require replacement too often. If the mean amperage is higher than 40, the manufacturer might be liable for damage to an electrical system due to fuse malfunction.

## 92 Tests About a Population Mean

The general discussion in Chapter 8 of confidence intervals for a population mean \(\mu\) focused on three different cases. We now develop test procedures for these same three cases.

### Case I: A Normal Population with known \(\sigma\)

Although the assumption that the value of \(\sigma\) is known is rarely met in practice, this case provides a good starting point because of the ease with which general procedures and their properties can be developed. The null hypothesis in all three cases will state that \(\mu\) has a particular numerical value, the _null value_, which we will denote by \(\mu_{0}\). Let \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) represent a random sample of size \(n\) from the normal population. Then the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) has a normal distribution with expected value \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(\mu_{\overline{X}}=\mu_{0}\). Consider now the statistic \(Z\) obtained by standardizing \(\overline{X}\) under the assumption that \(H_{0}\) is true:

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu_{0}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\]

Substitution of the computed sample mean \(\overline{x}\) gives \(z\), the distance between \(\overline{x}\) and \(\mu_{0}\) expressed in "standard deviation units." For example, if the null hypothesis is \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=100\), \(\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}=10/\sqrt{25}=2.0\) and \(\overline{x}=103\), then the test statistic value is given by \(z=(103-100)/2.0=1.5\). That is, the observed value of \(\overline{x}\) is 1.5 standard deviations (of \(\overline{X}\)) above what we expect it to be when \(H_{0}\) is true. The statistic \(Z\) is a natural measure of the distance between \(\overline{X}\), the estimator of \(\mu\), and its expected value when \(H_{0}\) is true. If this distance is too great in a direction consistent with \(H_{\text{a}}\), the null hypothesis should be rejected.

Suppose first that the alternative hypothesis has the form \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>\mu_{0}\). Then an \(\overline{x}\) value less than \(\mu_{0}\) certainly does not provide support for \(H_{\text{a}}\). Such an \(\overline{x}\) corresponds to a negative value of \(z\) (since \(\tau-\mu_{0}\) is negative and the divisor \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) is positive). Similarly, an \(\overline{x}\) value that exceeds \(\mu_{0}\) by only a small amount (corresponding to \(z\) which is positive but small) does not suggest that \(H_{0}\) should be rejected in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\). The rejection of \(H_{0}\) is appropriate only when \(\overline{x}\) considerably exceeds \(\mu_{0}\)--that is, when the \(z\) value is positive and large. In summary, the appropriate rejection region, based on the test statistic \(Z\) rather than \(\overline{X}\), has the form \(z\geq c\).

As discussed in Section 9.1, the cutoff value \(c\) should be chosen to control the probability of a type I error at the desired level \(\alpha\). This is easily accomplished because the distribution of the test statistic \(Z\) when \(H_{0}\) is true is the standard normal distribution (that's why \(\mu_{0}\) was subtracted in standardizing). The required cutoff \(c\) is the \(z\) critical value that captures upper-tail area \(\alpha\) under the standard normal curve. As an example, let \(c=1.645\), the value that captures tail area \(.05\) (\(z_{.05}=1.645\)). Then,

\[\alpha = P(\text{type I error})=P(H_{0}\text{ is rejected when }H_{0}\text{ is true})\] \[= P[Z\geq 1.645\text{ when }Z\sim N(0,1)]=1-\Phi(1.645)=.05\]

More generally, the rejection region \(z\geq z_{\alpha}\) has type I error probability \(\alpha\). The test procedure is _upper-tailed_ because the rejection region consists only of large values of the test statistic.

Analogous reasoning for the alternative hypothesis \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu<\mu_{0}\) suggests a rejection region of the form \(z\leq c\), where \(c\) is a suitably chosen negative number (\(\overline{x}\) is far below \(\mu_{0}\) if and only if \(z\) is quite negative). Because \(Z\) has a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true, taking \(c=-z_{\alpha}\) yields \(P(\text{type I error})=\alpha\). This is a _lower-tailed_ test. For example, \(z_{.10}=1.28\) implies that the rejection region \(z\leq-1.28\) specifies a test with significance level \(.10\).

Finally, when the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\), \(H_{0}\) should be rejected if \(\overline{x}\) is too far to either side of \(\mu_{0}\). This is equivalent to rejecting \(H_{0}\) either if \(z\geq c\) or if \(z\leq-c\). Suppose we desire \(\alpha=.05\). Then,

\[.05 = P(Z\geq c\text{ or }Z\leq-c\text{ when }Z\text{ has a standard normal distribution})\] \[= \Phi(-c)+1-\Phi(c)=2[1-\Phi(c)]\]Thus \(c\) is such that \(1\,-\,\Phi(c)\), the area under the standard normal curve to the right of \(c\), is.025 (and not.05!). From Section 4.3 or Appendix Table.3, \(c\,=\,1.96\), and the rejection region is \(z\geq 1.96\)_or_\(z\leq-1.96\). For any \(\alpha\), the _two-tailed_ rejection region \(z\geq z_{\alpha/2}\)_or_\(z\leq-z_{\alpha/2}\) has type I error probability \(\alpha\) (since area \(\alpha/2\) is captured under each of the two tails of the \(z\) curve). Again, the key reason for using the standardized test statistic \(Z\) is that because \(Z\) has a known distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true (standard normal), a rejection region with desired type I error probability is easily obtained by using an appropriate critical value.

The test procedure for Case I is summarized in the accompanying box, and the corresponding rejection regions are illustrated in Figure.

Use of the following sequence of steps is recommended when testing hypotheses about a parameter.

1. Identify the parameter of interest and describe it in the context of the problem situation.

Figure.2: Rejection regions for \(z\) tests: **(a)** upper–tailed test; **(b)** lower–tailed test; **(c)** two-tailed test

2. Determine the null value and state the null hypothesis.
3. State the appropriate alternative hypothesis.
4. Give the formula for the computed value of the test statistic (substituting the null value and the known values of any other parameters, but _not_ those of any sample-based quantities).
5. State the rejection region for the selected significance level a.
6. Compute any necessary sample quantities, substitute into the formula for the test statistic value, and compute that value.
7. Decide whether \(H_{0}\) should be rejected and state this conclusion in the problem context.

The formulation of hypotheses (steps 2 and 3) should be done before examining the data.

A manufacturer of sprinkler systems used for fire protection in office buildings claims that the true average system-activation temperature is 130\({}^{\circ}\). A sample of \(n=9\) systems, when tested, yields a sample average activation temperature of 131.08\({}^{\circ}\)F. If the distribution of activation times is normal with standard deviation 1.5\({}^{\circ}\)F, does the data contradict the manufacturer's claim at significance level a =.01?

1. Parameter of interest: \(\mu=\) true average activation temperature.
2. Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\) 130 (null value = \(\mu_{0}=\) 130).
3. Alternative hypothesis: \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq\) 130 (a departure from the claimed value in _either_ direction is of concern).
4. Test statistic value: \[z=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu_{0}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{\overline{x}-130}{1.5/ \sqrt{n}}\]
5. Rejection region: The form of \(H_{\text{a}}\) implies use of a two-tailed test with rejection region _either_\(z\geq z_{,005}\)_or_\(z\leq-z_{,005}\). From Section 4.3 or Appendix Table A.3, \(z_{,005}=\) 2.58, so we reject \(H_{0}\) if either \(z\geq\) 2.58 or \(z\leq-2.58\).
6. Substituting \(n=\) 9 and \(\overline{x}=131.08\), \[z=\frac{131.08-130}{1.5/\sqrt{9}}=\frac{1.08}{.5}=2.16\] That is, the observed sample mean is a bit more than 2 standard deviations above what would have been expected were \(H_{0}\) true.
7. The computed value \(z=\) 2.16 does not fall in the rejection region (\(-2.58<2.16<2.58\)), so \(H_{0}\) cannot be rejected at significance level.01. The data does not give strong support to the claim that the true average differs from the design value of 130.

Another view of the analysis in the previous example involves calculating a 99% CI for \(\mu\) based on Equation 8.5:

\[\overline{x}\pm 2.58\sigma/\sqrt{n}=131.08\pm 2.58(1.5/\sqrt{9})=131.08\pm 1.29 =(129.79,132.37)\]Notice that the interval includes \(\mu_{0}=130\), and it is not hard to see that the 99% CI excludes \(\mu_{0}\) if and only if the two-tailed hypothesis test rejects \(H_{0}\) at level.01. In general, the 100(\(1\ -\ \alpha\))% CI excludes \(\mu_{0}\) if and only if the two-tailed hypothesis test rejects \(H_{0}\) at level \(\alpha\). Although we will not always call attention to it, this kind of relationship between hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will occur over and over in the remainder of the book. It should be intuitively reasonable that the CI will exclude a value when the corresponding test rejects the value. There is a similar relationship between lower-tailed tests and upper confidence bounds, and also between upper-tailed tests and lower confidence bounds.

### \(b\) and Sample Size Determination

The \(z\) tests for Case I are among the few in statistics for which there are simple formulas available for \(\beta\), the probability of a type II error. Consider first the upper-tailed test with rejection region \(z\geq z_{\alpha}\). This is equivalent to \(\Upsilon\geq\mu_{0}+z_{\alpha}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\), so \(H_{0}\) will not be rejected if \(\Upsilon\!<\!\mu_{0}+z_{\alpha}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\). Now let \(\mu^{\prime}\) denote a particular value of \(\mu\) that exceeds the null value \(\mu_{0}\). Then,

\[\beta(\mu^{\prime}) = P(H_{0}\text{ is not rejected when }\mu=\mu^{\prime})\] \[= P(\overline{X}\!<\!\mu_{0}+z_{\alpha}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\text{ when }\mu=\mu^{\prime})\] \[= P\bigg{(}\frac{\overline{X}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\!<\! z_{\alpha}+\frac{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\text{ when }\mu=\mu^{\prime}\bigg{)}\] \[= \Phi\bigg{(}z_{\alpha}+\frac{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{ n}}\bigg{)}\]

As \(\mu^{\prime}\) increases, \(\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}\) becomes more negative, so \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})\) will be small when \(\mu^{\prime}\) greatly exceeds \(\mu_{0}\) (because the value at which \(\Phi\) is evaluated will then be quite negative). Error probabilities for the lower-tailed and two-tailed tests are derived in an analogous manner.

If \(\sigma\) is large, the probability of a type II error can be large at an alternative value \(\mu^{\prime}\) that is of particular concern to an investigator. Suppose we fix \(\alpha\) and also specify \(\beta\) for such an alternative value. In the sprinkler example, company officials might view \(\mu^{\prime}=132\) as a very substantial departure from \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=130\) and therefore wish \(\beta(132)=.10\) in addition to \(\alpha=.01\). More generally, consider the two restrictions \(P(\text{type I error})=\alpha\) and \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})=\beta\) for specified \(\alpha\), \(\mu^{\prime}\), and \(\beta\). Then for an upper-tailed test, the sample size \(n\) should be chosen to satisfy

\[\Phi\bigg{(}z_{\alpha}+\frac{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\bigg{)}=\beta\]

This implies that

\[-z_{\beta}=\begin{array}{c}z\text{ critical value that}\\ \text{captures lower tail area }\beta\end{array}=z_{\alpha}+\frac{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\]

It is easy to solve this equation for the desired \(n\). A parallel argument yields the necessary sample size for lower- and two-tailed tests as summarized in the next box.

**Alternative Hypothesis**

**Type II Error Probability \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})\) for a Level \(\alpha\) Test**

\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>\mu_{0}\)

\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu<\mu_{0}\)

\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\)

\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu<\mu_{0}\)

\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\)

\(\Phi\bigg{(}z_{\text{a}/2}+\frac{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\bigg{)} -\Phi\bigg{(}-z_{\text{a}/2}+\frac{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\bigg{)}\)

where \(\Phi(z)=\) the standard normal cdf.

The sample size \(n\) for which a level \(\alpha\) test also has \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})=\beta\) at the alternative value \(\mu^{\prime}\) is

\[n=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\bigg{[}\frac{\sigma(z_{\alpha}+z_{\beta})}{\mu_{0 }-\mu^{\prime}}\bigg{]}^{2}&\text{for a one - tailed}\\ \bigg{[}\frac{\sigma(z_{\text{a}/2}+z_{\beta})}{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}\bigg{]} ^{2}&\text{for a two - tailed test}\\ \bigg{[}\frac{\sigma(z_{\text{a}/2}+z_{\beta})}{\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}}\bigg{]} ^{2}&\text{(an approximate solution)}\end{array}\right.\]

Let \(\mu\) denote the true average tread life of a type of tire. Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\) 30,000 versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>\) 30,000 based on a sample of size \(n=16\) from a normal population distribution with \(\sigma=1500\). A test with \(\alpha=.01\) requires \(z_{\alpha}=z_{.01}\)\(=\) 2.33. The probability of making a type II error when \(\mu=\) 31,000 is

\[\beta(31,000)=\Phi\bigg{(}2.33+\frac{30,000-31,000}{1500/\sqrt{16}}\bigg{)}= \Phi(-.34)=.3669\]

Since \(z_{.1}=1.28\), the requirement that the level.01 test also have \(\beta(31,000)=.1\) necessitates

\[n=\bigg{[}\frac{1500(2.33+1.28)}{30,000-31,000}\bigg{]}^{2}=(-5.42)^{2}=29.32\]

The sample size must be an integer, so \(n=\) 30 tires should be used.

### Case II: Large-Sample Tests

When the sample size is large, the \(z\) tests for Case I are easily modified to yield valid test procedures without requiring either a normal population distribution or known \(\sigma\). The key result was used in Chapter 8 to justify large-sample confidence intervals: A large \(n\) implies that the sample standard deviation \(s\) will be close to \(\sigma\) for most samples, so that the standardized variable

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:455]

**3.**: \(H_{a}\)_: \(\mu>15\)
**4.**: \(z=\frac{\pi-15}{s/\sqrt{n}}\)
**5.**: Using a test with a significance level \(.05,H_{0}\) will be rejected if \(z\geq 1.645\) (an upper tailed test).
**6.**: With \(n=70\), \(\pi=17.99\), and \(s=5.937\),

\[z=\frac{17.99-15}{5.937/\sqrt{70}}=\frac{2.99}{.7096}=4.21\]
**7.**: Since \(4.21>1.645\), \(H_{0}\) is rejected. There is evidence that the population mean tip percentage exceeds \(15\%\).

Determination of \(\beta\) and the necessary sample size for these large-sample tests can be based either on specifying a plausible value of \(\sigma\) and using the Case I formulas (even though \(s\) is used in the test) or on using the methods to be introduced shortly in connection with Case III.

### Case III: A Normal Population Distribution with Unknown \(\sigma\)

When \(n\) is small, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) can no longer be invoked to justify the use of a large-sample test. We faced this same difficulty in obtaining a small-sample confidence interval (CI) for \(\mu\) in Chapter 8. Our approach here will be the same one used there: We will assume that the population distribution is at least approximately normal and describe test procedures whose validity rests on this assumption. If an investigator has good reason to believe that the population distribution is quite nonnormal, a distribution-free test from Chapter 14 can be used. Alternatively, a statistician can be consulted regarding procedures valid for specific families of population distributions other than the normal family. Or a bootstrap procedure can be developed.

The key result on which tests for a normal population mean are based was used in Chapter 8 to derive the one-sample \(t\) CI: If \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) is a random sample from a normal distribution, the standardized variable

\[T=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S/\sqrt{n}}\]

has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-1\) degrees of freedom (df). Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) against \(H_{a}\): \(\mu>\mu_{0}\) by using the test statistic \((\overline{X}-\mu_{0})/(S/\sqrt{n})\). That is, the test statistic results from standardizing \(\overline{X}\) under the assumption that \(H_{0}\) is true (using \(S/\sqrt{n}\), the estimated standard deviation of \(\overline{X}\), rather than \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)). When \(H_{0}\) is true, the test statistic has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-1\) df. Knowledge of the test statistic's distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true (the "null distribution") allows us to construct a rejection region for which the type I error probability is controlled at the desired level. In particular, use of the upper-tail \(t\) critical value \(t_{\alpha,n-1}\) to specify the rejection region \(t\geq t_{\alpha,n-1}\) implies that

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:457]

\[t=\frac{27.54-25}{5.47/\sqrt{5}}=\frac{2.54}{2.45}=1.04\]

The accompanying MINITAB output from a request for a one-sample \(t\) test has the same calculated values (the \(P\)-value is discussed in Section 9.4).

Test of mu = 25.00 vs mu > 25.00

Variable N Mean StDev SE Mean T P-Value

mawl 5 27.54 5.47 2.45 1.04 0.18

**7.**: Since 1.04 does not fall in the rejection region (1.04 \(<\) 2.132), \(H_{0}\) cannot be rejected at significance level.05. It is still plausible that \(\mu\) is (at most) 25.

\(\beta\) and Sample Size DeterminationThe calculation of \(\beta\) at the alternative value \(\mu^{\prime}\) in Case I was carried out by expressing the rejection region in terms of \(\overline{x}\) (e.g., \(\overline{x}\geq\mu_{0}+z_{\alpha}\cdot\sigma/\sqrt{n}\)) and then subtracting \(\mu^{\prime}\) to standardize correctly. An equivalent approach involves noting that when \(\mu=\mu^{\prime}\), the test statistic \(Z=(\overline{X}-\mu_{0})/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\) still has a normal distribution with variance 1, but now the mean value of \(Z\) is given by \((\mu^{\prime}-\mu_{0})/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\). That is, when \(\mu=\mu^{\prime}\), the test statistic still has a normal distribution though not the standard normal distribution. Because of this, \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})\) is an area under the normal curve corresponding to mean value \((\mu^{\prime}-\mu_{0})/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\) and variance 1. Both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) involve working with normally distributed variables.

The calculation of \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})\) for the \(t\) test is much less straightforward. This is because the distribution of the test statistic \(T=(\overline{X}-\mu_{0})/(S/\sqrt{n})\) is quite complicated when \(H_{0}\) is false and \(H_{\rm a}\) is true. Thus, for an upper-tailed test, determining

\[\beta(\mu^{\prime})=P(T<t_{\alpha,n-1}\quad\mbox{when $\mu=\mu^{\prime}$ rather than $\mu_{0}$})\]

involves integrating a very unpleasant density function. This must be done numerically, but fortunately it has been done by research statisticians for both one- and two-tailed \(t\) tests. The results are summarized in graphs of \(\beta\) that appear in Appendix Table A.16. There are four sets of graphs, corresponding to one-tailed tests at level.05 and level.01 and two-tailed tests at the same levels.

To understand how these graphs are used, note first that both \(\beta\) and the necessary sample size \(n\) in Case I are functions not just of the absolute difference \(|\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}|\) but of \(d=|\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}|/\sigma\). Suppose, for example, that \(|\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}|=10\). This departure from \(H_{0}\) will be much easier to detect (smaller \(\beta\)) when \(\sigma=2\), in which case \(\mu_{0}\) and \(\mu^{\prime}\) are 5 population standard deviations apart, than when \(\sigma=10\). The fact that \(\beta\) for the \(t\) test depends on \(d\) rather than just \(|\mu_{0}-\mu^{\prime}|\) is unfortunate, since to use the graphs one must have some idea of the true value of \(\sigma\). A conservative (large) guess for \(\sigma\) will yield a conservative (large) value of \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})\) and a conservative estimate of the sample size necessary for prescribed \(\alpha\) and \(\beta(\mu^{\prime})\).

Once the alternative \(\mu^{\prime}\) and value of \(\sigma\) are selected, \(d\) is calculated and its value located on the horizontal axis of the relevant set of curves. The value of \(\beta\) is the height of the \(n-1\) df curve above the value of \(d\) (visual interpolation is necessary if \(n-1\) is not a value for which the corresponding curve appears), as illustrated in Figure 9.4.

Rather than fixing \(n\) (i.e., \(n\,-\,1\), and thus the particular curve from which \(\beta\) is read), one might prescribe both \(\alpha\) (.05 or.01 here) and a value of \(\beta\) for the chosen \(\mu^{\prime}\) and \(\sigma\). After computing \(d\), the point (\(d\), \(\beta\)) is located on the relevant set of graphs. The curve below and closest to this point gives \(n\,-\,1\) and thus \(n\) (again, interpolation is often necessary).

The true average voltage drop from collector to emitter of insulated gate bipolar transistors of a certain type is supposed to be at most 2.5 V. An investigator selects a sample of \(n\,=\,10\) such transistors and uses the resulting voltages as a basis for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu\,=\,2.5\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu\,>\,2.5\) using a \(t\) test with significance level \(\alpha\,=\,.05\). If the standard deviation of the voltage distribution is \(\sigma\,=\,.100\), how likely is it that \(H_{0}\) will not be rejected when \(\mu\,=\,2.6\)? With \(d\,=\,|2.5\,-\,2.6|/.100\,=\,1.0\), the point on the \(\beta\) curve at 9 df for a one-tailed test with \(\alpha\,=\,.05\) above 1.0 has height approximately.1, so \(\beta\,\approx\,.1\). The investigator might think that this is too large a value of \(\beta\) for such a substantial departure from \(H_{0}\) and may wish to have \(\beta\,=\,.05\) for this alternative value of \(\mu\). Since \(d\,=\,1.0\), the point (\(d\), \(\beta\)) \(\,=\,(1.0\),.05) must be located. This point is very close to the 14 df curve, so using \(n\,=\,15\) will give both \(\alpha\,=\,.05\) and \(\beta\,=\,.05\) when the value of \(\mu\) is 2.6 and \(\sigma\,=\,.10\). A larger value of \(\sigma\) would give a larger \(\beta\) for this alternative, and an alternative value of \(\mu\) closer to 2.5 would also result in an increased value of \(\beta\). \(\blacksquare\)

Most of the widely used statistical computer packages will also calculate type II error probabilities and determine necessary sample sizes. As an example, we asked MINITAB to do the calculations from Example 9.10. Its computations are based on **power**, which is simply \(1\,-\,\beta\). We want \(\beta\) to be small, which is equivalent to asking that the power of the test be large. For example, \(\beta\,=\,.05\) corresponds to a value of.95 for power. Here is the resulting MINITAB output.

##### Power and Sample Size

Testing mean = null (versus > null) Calculating power for mean = null + 0.1

Figure 9.4: A typical \(\beta\) curve for the \(t\) test

Alpha = 0.05 Sigma = 0.1

Sample Size Power 10 0.8975

Power and Sample Size

Sample Target Actual Size Power Power 13 0.9500 0.9597

Notice from the second part of the output that the sample size necessary to obtain a power of.95 (\(\beta=.05\)) for an upper-tailed test with \(\alpha=.05\) when \(\sigma=.1\) and \(\mu^{\prime}\) is.1 larger than \(\mu_{0}\) is only \(n=13\), whereas eyeballing our \(\beta\) curves gave 15. When available, this type of software is more trustworthy than the curves.

### 9.3 Tests Concerning a Population Proportion

Let \(p\) denote the proportion of individuals or objects in a population who possess a specified property (e.g., cars with manual transmissions or smokers who smoke a filter cigarette). If an individual or object with the property is labeled a success (\(S\)), then \(p\) is the population proportion of successes. Tests concerning \(p\) will be based on a random sample of size \(n\) from the population. Provided that \(n\) is small relative to the population size, \(X\) (the number of \(S\)'s in the sample) has (approximately) a binomial distribution. Furthermore, if \(n\) itself is large, both \(X\) and the estimator \(\hat{p}=X/n\) are approximately normally distributed. We first consider large-sample tests based on this latter fact and then turn to the small-sample case that directly uses the binomial distribution.

### Large-Sample Tests

Large-sample tests concerning \(p\) are a special case of the more general large-sample procedures for a parameter \(\theta\). Let \(\hat{\theta}\) be an estimator of \(\theta\) that is (at least approximately) unbiased and has approximately a normal distribution. The null hypothesis has the form \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=\theta_{0}\), where \(\theta_{0}\) denotes a number (the null value) appropriate to the problem context. Suppose that when \(H_{0}\) is true, the standard deviation of \(\hat{\theta}\), \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\), involves no unknown parameters. For example, if \(\theta=\mu\) and \(\hat{\theta}=\overline{X}\), \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}=\sigma_{\overline{X}}=\sigma/\sqrt{n}\), which involves no unknown parameters only if the value of \(\sigma\) is known. A large-sample test statistic results from standardizing \(\hat{\theta}\) under the assumption that \(H_{0}\) is true [so that \(E(\hat{\theta})=\theta_{0}\)]:

\[\text{Test statistic: }\frac{\hat{\theta}-\theta_{0}}{\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}}\]

If the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta>\theta_{0}\), an upper-tailed test whose significance level is approximately \(\alpha\) is specified by the rejection region \(z\geq z_{\alpha}\). The other two alternatives, \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta<\theta_{0}\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta\neq\theta_{0}\), are tested using a lower-tailed \(z\) test and a two-tailed \(z\) test, respectively.

In the case \(\theta=p\), \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) will not involve any unknown parameters when \(H_{0}\) is true, but this is atypical. When \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) does involve unknown parameters, it is often possible to use an estimated standard deviation \(S_{\hat{\theta}}\) in place of \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) and still have \(Z\) approximately normally distributed when \(H_{0}\) is true (because when \(n\) is large, \(s_{\hat{\theta}}\approx\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) for most samples). The large-sample test of the previous section furnishes an example of this: Because \(\sigma\) is usually unknown, we use \(s_{\hat{\theta}}=s_{\overline{X}}=s/\sqrt{n}\) in place of \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\) in the denominator of \(z\).

The estimator \(\hat{p}=X/n\) is unbiased [\(E(\hat{p})=p\)], has approximately a normal distribution, and its standard deviation is \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}\). These facts were used in Section 8.2 to obtain a confidence interval for \(p\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(E(\hat{p})=p_{0}\) and \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{p_{0}(1-p_{0})/n}\), so \(\sigma_{\hat{p}}\) does not involve any unknown parameters. It then follows that when \(n\) is large and \(H_{0}\) is true, the test statistic

\[Z=\frac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{p_{0}(1-p_{0})/n}}\]has approximately a standard normal distribution. If the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p>p_{0}\) and the upper-tailed rejection region \(z\geq z_{\text{a}}\) is used, then \[P(\text{type I error}) = P(H_{0}\text{ is rejected when it is true}) = P(Z\geq z_{\text{a}}\text{ when }Z\text{ has approximately a standard normal distribution}) \approx \alpha\] Thus the desired level of significance \(\alpha\) is attained by using the critical value that captures area \(\alpha\) in the upper tail of the \(z\) curve. Rejection regions for the other two alternative hypotheses, lower-tailed for \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<p_{0}\) and two-tailed for \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p\neq p_{0}\), are justified in an analogous manner.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\): \(p=p_{0}\) \\ Test statistic value: \(z=\dfrac{\hat{p}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{p_{0}(1-p_{0})/n}}\) \\ \end{tabular}
**Alternative Hypothesis** & **Rejection Region** \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p>p_{0}\) & \(z\geq z_{\text{a}}\) (upper-tailed) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<p_{0}\) & \(z\leq-z_{\text{a}}\) (lower-tailed) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p\neq p_{0}\) & either \(z\geq z_{\text{a/2}}\) or \(z\leq-z_{\text{a/2}}\) (two-tailed) \\ \end{tabular}

These test procedures are valid provided that \(np_{0}\geq 10\) and \(n(1-p_{0})\geq 10\).

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline Example 9.11 & Recent information suggests that obesity is an increasing problem in America among all age groups. The Associated Press (Oct. 9, 2002) reported that 1276 individuals in a sample of 4115 adults were found to be obese (a body mass index exceeding 30; this index is a measure of weight relative to height). A 1998 survey based on people's own assessment revealed that 20% of adult Americans considered themselves obese. Does the recent data suggest that the true proportion of adults who are obese is more than 1.5 times the percentage from the self-assessment survey? Let's carry out a test of hypotheses using a significance level of.10. \\ \end{tabular}
**1.**\(p=\) the proportion of all American adults who are obese.
**2.** Saying that the current percentage is 1.5 times the self-assessment percentage is equivalent to the assertion that the current percentage is 30%, from which we have the null hypothesis as \(H_{0}\): \(p=.30\).
**3.** The phrase "more than" in the problem description implies that the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p>.30\).
**4.** Since \(np_{0}=4115(.3)\geq 10\) and \(nq_{0}=4115(.7)\geq 10\), the large-sample \(z\) test can certainly be used. The test statistic value is \[z=(\hat{p}-.3)/\sqrt{(.3)(.7)/n}\]5. The form of \(H_{\rm a}\) implies that an upper-tailed test is appropriate: Reject \(H_{0}\) if \(z\geq z_{.10}=1.28\). 6. \(\hat{p}=1276/4115=.310\), from which \(z=(.310-.3)/\sqrt{(.3)(.7)/4115}=.010/.0071=1.40\). 7. Since 1.40 exceeds the critical value 1.28, \(z\) lies in the rejection region. This justifies rejecting the null hypothesis. Using a significance level of.10, it does appear that more than 30% of American adults are obese. \(\blacksquare\)

\(\beta\) and Sample Size DeterminationWhen \(H_{0}\) is true, the test statistic \(Z\) has approximately a standard normal distribution. Now suppose that \(H_{0}\) is _not_ true and that \(p=p^{\prime}\). Then \(Z\) still has approximately a normal distribution (because it is a linear function of \(\hat{p}\)), but its mean value and variance are no longer 0 and 1, respectively. Instead,

\[E(Z)=\frac{p^{\prime}-p_{0}}{\sqrt{p_{0}(1-p_{0})/n}}\quad V(Z)=\frac{p^{\prime }(1-p^{\prime})/n}{p_{0}(1-p_{0})/n}\]

The probability of a type II error for an upper-tailed test is \(\beta(p^{\prime})=P(Z<z_{\alpha}\) when \(p=p^{\prime})\). This can be computed by using the given mean and variance to standardize and then referring to the standard normal cdf. In addition, if it is desired that the level \(\alpha\) test also have \(\beta(p^{\prime})=\beta\) for a specified value of \(\beta\), this equation can be solved for the necessary \(n\) as in Section 9.2. General expressions for \(\beta(p^{\prime})\) and \(n\) are given in the accompanying box.

Let \(p\) denote the true proportion of such packages that are delivered as advertised and consider the hypotheses \(H_{0}\): \(p=.9\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<.9\). If only 80% of the packages are delivered as advertised, how likely is it that a level.01 test based on \(n=225\) packages will detect such a departure from \(H_{0}\)? What should the sample size be to ensure that \(\beta(.8)=.01\)? With \(\alpha=.01\), \(p_{0}=.9\), \(p^{\prime}=.8\), and \(n=225\),

\[\beta(.8)=1-\Phi\left[\frac{.9-.8-2.33\sqrt{(.9)(.1)/225}}{\sqrt{(.8)(.2)/225} }\right]=1-\Phi(2.00)=.0228\]

Thus the probability that \(H_{0}\) will be rejected using the test when \(p=.8\) is.9772--roughly 98% of all samples will result in correct rejection of \(H_{0}\).

Using \(z_{\alpha}=z_{\beta}=2.33\) in the sample size formula yields

\[n=\left[\frac{2.33\sqrt{(.9)(.1)}+2.33\sqrt{(.8)(.2)}}{.8-.9}\right]^{2}\approx 266\]

### Small-Sample Tests

Test procedures when the sample size \(n\) is small are based directly on the binomial distribution rather than the normal approximation. Consider the alternative hypothesis \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p>p_{0}\) and again let \(X\) be the number of successes in the sample. Then \(X\) is the test statistic, and the upper-tailed rejection region has the form \(x\geq c\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(X\) has a binomial distribution with parameters \(n\) and \(p_{0}\), so

\[P(\text{type I error}) =P(H_{0}\text{ is rejected when it is true})\] \[=P[X\geq c\text{ when }X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p_{0})]\] \[=1-P[X\leq c-1\text{ when }X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p_{0})]\] \[=1-B(c-1;\ n,\ p_{0})\]

As the critical value \(c\) decreases, more \(x\) values are included in the rejection region and \(P(\text{type I error})\) increases. Because \(X\) has a discrete probability distribution, it is usually not possible to find a value of \(c\) for which \(P(\text{type I error})\) is exactly the desired significance level \(\alpha\) (e.g.,.05 or.01). Instead, the largest rejection region of the form {_c_, \(c\) + 1,.., _n_} satisfying \(1-B(c-1;\ n,\ p_{0})\leq\alpha\) is used.

Let \(p^{\prime}\) denote an alternative value of \(p\) (\(p^{\prime}\)\(>\)\(p_{0}\)). When \(p=p^{\prime},X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p^{\prime})\), so

\[\beta(p^{\prime}) =P(\text{type II error when }p=p^{\prime})=P[X<c\text{ when }X\sim\text{Bin}(n,p^{\prime})]\] \[=B(c-1;\ n,\ p^{\prime})\]

That is, \(\beta(p^{\prime})\) is the result of a straightforward binomial probability calculation. The sample size \(n\) necessary to ensure that a level \(\alpha\) test also has specified \(\beta\) at a particular alternative value \(p^{\prime}\) must be determined by trial and error using the binomial cdf.

Test procedures for \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p<p_{0}\) and for \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p\neq p_{0}\) are constructed in a similar manner. In the former case, the appropriate rejection region has the form \(x\leq c\) (a lower-tailed test). The critical value \(c\) is the largest number satisfying \(B(c;\ n,\ p_{0})\leq\alpha\).

The rejection region when the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\alpha}\): \(p\neq p_{0}\) consists of both large and small \(x\) values.

A plastics manufacturer has developed a new type of plastic trash can and proposes to sell them with an unconditional 6-year warranty. To see whether this is economically feasible, 20 prototype cans are subjected to an accelerated life test to simulate 6 years of use. The proposed warranty will be modified only if the sample data strongly suggests that fewer than 90% of such cans would survive the 6-year period. Let \(p\) denote the proportion of all cans that survive the accelerated test. The relevant hypotheses are then \(H_{0}\): \(p=.9\) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): \(p<.9\). A decision will be based on the test statistic \(X\), the number among the 20 that survive. If the desired significance level is \(\alpha\) =.05, \(c\) must satisfy \(B(c;\,20,\,.9)\leq.05\). From Appendix Table A.1, \(B(15;\,20,\,.9)=.043\), and \(B(16;\,20,\,.9)=.133\). The appropriate rejection region is therefore \(x\leq 15\). If the accelerated test results in \(x=14\), \(H_{0}\) would be rejected in favor of \(H_{\alpha}\), necessitating a modification of the proposed warranty. The probability of a type II error for the alternative value \(p^{\prime}=.8\) is

\[\beta(.8) = P[H_{0}\text{ is not rejected when }X\sim\text{Bin}(20,\,\,.8)]\] \[= P[X\geq 16\text{ when }X\sim\text{Bin}(20,\,\,.8)]\] \[= 1-B(15;\,20,\,\,.8)-1-.370=.630\] That is, when \(p=.8\), 63% of all samples consisting of \(n=20\) cans would result in \(H_{0}\) being incorrectly not rejected. This error probability is high because 20 is a small sample size and \(p^{\prime}=.8\) is close to the null value \(p_{0}=.9\).

A random sample of 200 cars tested in a particular county during the current year yields 124 that passed on the initial test. Does this suggest that the true proportion for this county during the current year differs from the previous statewide proportion? Test the relevant hypotheses using \(\alpha=.05\).
**37.**: A manufacturer of nickel-hydrogen batteries randomly selects 100 nickel plates for test cells, cycles them a specified number of times, and determines that 14 of the plates have blistered.

**39.**: A university library ordinarily has a complete shelf inventory done once every year. Because of new shelving rules instituted the previous year, the head librarian believes it may be possible to save money by postponing the inventory. The librarian decides to select at random 1000 books from the library's collection and have them searched in a preliminary manner. If evidence indicates strongly that the true proportion of misshelved or unlocatable books is \(<\).02, then the inventory will be postponed. * Among the 1000 books searched, 15 were mis-shelved or unlocatable. Test the relevant hypotheses and advise the librarian what to do (use \(\alpha=.05\)). * If the true proportion of misshelved and lost books is actually.01, what is the probability that the inventory will be (unnecessarily) taken? * If the true proportion is.05, what is the probability that the inventory will be postponed?

Alabama_ (1965), in which it was alleged that there was discrimination against blacks in grand jury selection. Census data suggested that 25% of those eligible for grand jury service were black, yet a random sample of 1050 people called to appear for possible duty yielded only 177 blacks. Using a level.01 test, does this data argue strongly for a conclusion of discrimination?

Let \(p\) denote the proportion of all such players who would prefer gut to nylon, and let \(X\) be the number of players in the sample who prefer gut. Because gut strings are more expensive, consider the null hypothesis that at most 50% of all such players prefer gut. We simplify this to \(H\)0: \(p\) =.5, planning to reject \(H\)0 only if sample evidence strongly favors gut strings.

The manufacturer decides to subject \(n\) of these faucets to accelerated testing (approximating 2 years of normal use). With \(X\) = the number among the \(n\) faucets that leak before the test concludes, production will commence unless the observed \(X\) is too large. It is decided that if \(p\) =.10, the probability of not proceeding should be at most.10, whereas if \(p\) =.30 the probability of proceeding should be at most.10.

According to the FDA, 90% of all Americans have PFOA in their blood. * Does the data on PFOA incidence among children suggest that the percentage of all children who have PFOA in their blood exceeds the FDA percentage for all Americans? Carry out an appropriate test of hypotheses. * If 95% of all children have PFOA in their blood, how likely is it that the null hypothesis tested in (a) will be rejected when a significance level of.01 is employed? * Referring back to (b), what sample size would be necessary for the relevant probability to be.10?

## Chapter 9 \(P\)-Values

Using the rejection region method to test hypotheses entails first selecting a significance level \(\alpha\). Then after computing the value of the test statistic, the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\) is rejected if the value falls in the rejection region and is otherwise not rejected. We now consider another way of reaching a conclusion in a hypothesis testing analysis. This alternative approach is based on calculation of a certain probability called a \(P\)-_value_. One advantage is that the \(P\)-value provides an intuitive measure of the strength of evidence in the data against \(H_{0}\)

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & The \(P\)**-value** is the probability, calculated assuming that the null hypothesis is true, of obtaining a value of the test statistic at least as contradictory to \(H_{0}\) as the value calculated from the available sample. \\ \end{tabular}

The definition is quite a mouthful. Here are some key points:

* The \(P\)-value is a probability.
* This probability is calculated assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
* To determine the \(P\)-value, we must first decide which values of the test statistic are at least as contradictory to \(H_{0}\) as the value obtained from our sample.

\begin{tabular}{c c}  & Urban storm water can be contaminated by many sources, including discarded batteries. When ruptured, these batteries release metals of environmental significance. The paper "Urban Battery Litter" (\(J\). _Environ. Engr._, 2009: 46-57) presented summary data for characteristics of a variety of batteries found in urban areas around Cleveland. A sample of 51 Panasonic AAA batteries gave a sample mean zinc mass of 2.06 g. and a sample standard deviation of.141 g. Does this data provide compelling evidence for concluding that the population mean zinc mass exceeds 2.0 g.?

With \(\mu\) denoting the true average zinc mass for such batteries, the relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=2.0\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu>2.0\). The sample size is large enough so that a \(z\) test can be used without making any specific assumption about the shape of the population distribution. The test statistic value is

\[z=\frac{\overline{x}-2.0}{s/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{2.06-2.0}{.141/\sqrt{51}}=3.04\]

Now we must decide which values of \(z\) are at least as contradictory to \(H_{0}\). Let's first consider an easier task: Which values of \(\overline{x}\) are at least as contradictory to the null hypothesis as 2.06, the mean of the observations in our sample? Because \(>\) appears in \(H_{\rm a}\), it should be clear that 2.10 is at least as contradictory to \(H_{0}\) as is 2.06, so is 2.25, and so in fact is _any_\(\overline{x}\) value that exceeds 2.06. But an \(\overline{x}\) value that exceeds 2.06 corresponds to a value of \(z\) that exceeds 3.04. Thus the \(P\)-value is

\[P\mbox{-value}=P(Z\geq 3.04\ \ \mbox{when}\ \mu=2.0)\]Since the test statistic \(Z\) was created by subtracting the null value 2.0 in the numerator, when \(\mu=2.0\) (i.e., when \(H_{0}\) is true) \(Z\) has approximately a standard normal distribution. As a result, \[P\text{-value} = P(Z\geq 3.04\text{ when }\mu=2.0)\] \[\approx\text{area under the }z\text{ curve to the right of }3.04\] \[= 1-\Phi(3.04)=.0012\] \(\blacksquare\) We will shortly illustrate how to determine the \(P\)-value for any \(z\) or \(t\) test; that is, any test where the reference distribution is the standard normal distribution (and \(z\) curve) or some \(t\) distribution (and corresponding \(t\) curve). For the moment, though, let's focus on reaching a conclusion once the \(P\)-value is available. Because it is a probability, the \(P\)-value must be between 0 and 1. What kinds of \(P\)-values provide evidence against the null hypothesis? Consider two specific instances: * \(P\text{-value}=.250\): In this case, fully 25% of all possible test statistic values are more contradictory to \(H_{0}\) than the one that came out of our sample. So our data is not that contradictory to the null hypothesis. * \(P\text{-value}=.0018\): Here, only.18%, much less than 1%, of all possible test statistic values, are at least as contradictory to \(H_{0}\) as what we obtained. Thus the sample appears to be highly contradictory to the null hypothesis. More generally, _the smaller the \(P\)-value_, _the more evidence there is in the sample data against the null hypothesis and for the alternative hypothesis_. That is, \(H_{0}\) should be rejected in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\) when the \(P\)-value is sufficiently small. So what constitutes "sufficiently small"?

\begin{tabular}{c c} DECISION & \\ RULE BASED & Select a significance level \(\alpha\) (as before, the desired type I error probability). \\ ON THE & Then reject \(H_{0}\) if \(P\)-value \(\leq\alpha\); do not reject \(H_{0}\) if \(P\)-value \(>\alpha\) \\ \end{tabular}

Thus if the \(P\)-value exceeds the chosen significance level, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at that level. But if the \(P\)-value is equal to or \(<\alpha\), then there is enough evidence to justify rejecting \(H_{0}\). In Example 8.14, we calculated \(P\text{-value}=.0012\). Then using a significance level of.01, we would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis because.0012 \(\leq\).01. However, suppose we select a significance level of only.001, which requires more substantial evidence from the data before \(H_{0}\) can be rejected. In this case we would not reject \(H_{0}\) because.0012 \(>\).001.

How does the decision rule based on the \(P\)-value compare to the decision rule employed in the rejection region approach? _The two procedures--the rejection region method and the \(P\)-value method--are in fact identical_. Whatever the conclusion reached by employing the rejection region approach with a particular \(\alpha\), the same conclusion will be reached via the \(P\)-value approach using that same \(\alpha\).

The nicotine content problem discussed in Example 9.5 involved testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=1.5\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>1.5\) using a \(z\) test (i.e., a test which utilizes the \(z\) curve as the reference distribution). The inequality in \(H_{\text{a}}\) implies that the upper-tailedrejection region \(z\geq z_{\alpha}\) is appropriate. Suppose \(z=2.10\). Then using exactly the same reasoning as in Example 8.14 gives \(P\)-value \(=1-\Phi(2.10)=.0179\). Consider now testing with several different significance levels:

\[\alpha =.10\Rightarrow z_{\alpha}=z_{.10}=1.28\Rightarrow 2.10\geq 1.28 \Rightarrow\text{ reject }H_{0}\] \[\alpha =.05\Rightarrow z_{\alpha}=z_{.05}=1.645\Rightarrow 2.10\geq 1.645 \Rightarrow\text{ reject }H_{0}\] \[\alpha =.01\Rightarrow z_{\alpha}=z_{.01}=2.33\Rightarrow 2.10<2.33 \Rightarrow\text{ do not reject }H_{0}\]

Because \(P\)-value \(=.0179\leq.10\) and also \(.0179\leq.05\), using the \(P\)-value approach results in rejection of \(H_{0}\) for the first two significance level. However, for \(\alpha=.01\), \(2.10\) is not in the rejection region and \(.0179\) is larger than \(.01\). More generally, whenever \(\alpha\) is smaller than the \(P\)-value \(.0179\), the critical value \(z_{\alpha}\) will be beyond the \(P\)-value and \(H_{0}\) cannot be rejected by either method. This is illustrated in Figure 9.5.

Let's reconsider the \(P\)-value \(.0012\) in Example 9.14 once again. \(H_{0}\) can be rejected only if \(.0012\leq\alpha\). Thus the null hypothesis can be rejected if \(\alpha=.05\) or \(.01\) or \(.005\) or \(.0015\) or \(.00125\). What is the _smallest_ significance level \(\alpha\) here for which \(H_{0}\) can be rejected? It is the \(P\)-value \(.0012\).

PROPOSITION The \(P\)-value is the smallest significance level \(\alpha\) at which the null hypothesis can be rejected. Because of this, the \(P\)-value is alternatively referred to as the **observed significance level** (OSL) for the data.

It is customary to call the data _significant_ when \(H_{0}\) is rejected and _not significant_ otherwise. The \(P\)-value is then the smallest level at which the data is

Figure 9.5: Relationship between \(\alpha\) and tail area captured by computed \(z\): (a) tail area captured by computed \(z\); (b) when \(\alpha>.0179\), \(z_{\alpha}<2.10\) and \(H_{0}\) is rejected; (c) when \(\alpha<.0179\), \(z_{\alpha}>2.10\) and \(H_{0}\) is not rejected

significant. An easy way to visualize the comparison of the \(P\)-value with the chosen \(\alpha\) is to draw a picture like that of Figure 9.6. The calculation of the \(P\)-value depends on whether the test is upper-, lower-, or two-tailed. However, once it has been calculated, the comparison with \(\alpha\) does not depend on which type of test was used.

The true average time to initial relief of pain for a best-selling pain reliever is known to be 10 min. Let \(\mu\) denote the true average time to relief for a company's newly developed reliever. Suppose that when data from an experiment involving the new pain reliever was analyzed, the \(P\)-value for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=10\) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\mu<10\) was calculated as.0384. Since \(\alpha=.05\) is larger than the \(P\)-value [.05 lies in the interval (a) of Figure 9.6], \(H_{0}\) would be rejected by anyone carrying out the test at level.05. However, at level.01, \(H_{0}\) would not be rejected because.01 is smaller than the smallest level (.0384) at which \(H_{0}\) can be rejected.

The most widely used statistical computer packages automatically include a \(P\)-value when a hypothesis-testing analysis is performed. A conclusion can then be drawn directly from the output, without reference to a table of critical values. With the \(P\)-value in hand, an investigator can see at a quick glance for which significance levels \(H_{0}\) would or would not be rejected. Also, each individual can then select his or her own significance level. In addition, knowing the \(P\)-value allows a decision maker to distinguish between a close call (e.g., \(\alpha=.05\), \(P\)-value \(=.0498\)) and a very clear-cut conclusion (e.g., \(\alpha=.05\), \(P\)-value \(=.0003\)), something that would not be possible just from the statement "\(H_{0}\) can be rejected at significance level.05."

### \(P\)-Values for \(z\) Tests

The \(P\)-value for a \(z\) test (one based on a test statistic whose distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true is at least approximately standard normal) is easily determined from the information in Appendix Table A.3. Consider an upper-tailed test and let \(z\) denote the computed value of the test statistic \(Z\). The null hypothesis is rejected if \(z\geq z_{\alpha}\), and the \(P\)-value is the smallest \(\alpha\) for which this is the case. Since \(z_{\alpha}\) increases as \(\alpha\) decreases, the \(P\)-value is the value of \(\alpha\) for which \(z=z_{\alpha}\). That is, the \(P\)-value is just the area captured by the computed value \(z\) in the upper tail of the standard normal curve. The corresponding cumulative area is \(\Phi(z)\), so in this case \(P\)-value \(=1-\Phi(z)\).

An analogous argument for a lower-tailed test shows that the \(P\)-value is the area captured by the computed value \(z\) in the lower tail of the standard normal curve. More care must be exercised in the case of a two-tailed test. Suppose first that \(z\) is positive. Then the \(P\)-value is the value of \(\alpha\) satisfying \(z=z_{\alpha/2}\) (i.e., computed \(z=\) upper-tail

Figure 9.6: Comparing \(\alpha\) and the \(P\)-value: **(a)** reject \(H_{0}\) when \(\alpha\) lies here; **(b)** do not reject \(H_{0}\) when \(\alpha\) lies here

critical value). This says that the area captured in the upper tail is half the \(P\)-value, so that \(P\)-value \(\,=\,2[1\,\,-\,\Phi(z)]\). If \(z\) is negative, the \(P\)-value is the \(\alpha\) for which \(z\,=\,-z_{a/2}\), or, equivalently, \(-z\,=\,z_{a/2}\), so \(P\)-value \(\,=\,2[1\,\,-\,\Phi(-z)]\). Since \(-z\,=\,|z|\) when \(z\) is negative, the \(P\)-value \(\,=\,2[1\,\,-\,\Phi([z])]\) for either positive or negative \(z\).

Each of these is the probability of getting a value at least as extreme as what was obtained (assuming \(H_{0}\) true). The three cases are illustrated in Figure 9.7.

The next example illustrates the use of the \(P\)-value approach to hypothesis testing by means of a sequence of steps modified from our previously recommended sequence.

The target thickness for silicon wafers used in a type of integrated circuit is 245 \(\mu\)m. A sample of 50 wafers is obtained and the thickness of each one is determined, resulting in a sample mean thickness of 246.18 \(\mu\)m and a sample standard deviation of 3.60 \(\mu\)m. Does this data suggest that true average wafer thickness is something other than the target value?

**1.**: Parameter of interest: \(\mu=\) true average wafer thickness
**2.**: Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\) 245
**3.**: Alternative hypothesis: \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq\) 245
**4.**: Formula for test statistic value: \(z=\dfrac{\overline{x}-245}{s/\sqrt{n}}\)
**5.**: Calculation of test statistic value: \(z=\dfrac{246.18-245}{3.60\sqrt{\text{$\sqrt{5}0}$}}=2.32\)
**6.**: Determination of \(P\)-value: Because the test is two-tailed,

\[P\text{-value}=2[1-\Phi(2.32)]=.0204\]
**7.**: Conclusion: Using a significance level of.01, \(H_{0}\) would not be rejected since

.0204 \(>\).01. At this significance level, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that true average thickness differs from the target value.

### \(P\)-Values for \(t\) Tests

Just as the \(P\)-value for a \(z\) test is a \(z\) curve area, the \(P\)-value for a \(t\) test will be a \(t\) curve area. Figure 9.8 illustrates the three different cases. The number of df for the one-sample \(t\) test is \(n\,-\,1\).

The table of \(t\) critical values used previously for confidence and prediction intervals doesn't contain enough information about any particular \(t\) distribution to allow for accurate determination of desired areas. So we have included another \(t\) table in Appendix Table A.7, one that contains a tabulation of upper-tail \(t\) curve areas. Each different column of the table is for a different number of df, and the rows are for calculated values of the test statistic \(t\) ranging from 0.0 to 4.0 in increments of.1. For example, the number.074 appears at the intersection of the 1.6 row and the 8 df column, so the area under the 8 df curve to the right of 1.6 (an upper-tail area) is.074. Because \(t\) curves are symmetric,.074 is also the area under the 8 df curve to the left of \(-1.6\) (a lower-tail area).

Suppose, for example, that a test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\) 100 versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>\) 100 is based on the 8 df \(t\) distribution. If the calculated value of the test statistic is \(t=\) 1.6, then the \(P\)-value for this upper-tailed test is.074. Because.074 exceeds.05, we would not be able to reject \(H_{0}\) at a significance level of.05. If the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu<\) 100 and a test based on 20 df yields \(t=-\)3.2, then Appendix Table A.7 shows that the \(P\)-value is the captured lower-tail area.002. The null hypothesis can be rejected at either level.05 or.01. Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\) 0 versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq\) 0; the null hypothesis states that the means of the two populations are identical, whereas the alternative hypothesis states that they are different without specifying a direction of departure from \(H_{0}\). If a \(t\) test is based on 20 df and \(t=\) 3.2, then the \(P\)-value for this two-tailed test is 2(.002) \(=\).004. This would also be the \(P\)-value for \(t=-\)3.2. The tail area is doubled because values both larger than 3.2 and smaller than \(-\)3.2 are more contradictory to \(H_{0}\) than what was calculated (values farther out in _either_ tail of the \(t\) curve).

In Example 9.9, we carried out a test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=25\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>25\) based on 4 df. The calculated value of \(t\) was 1.04. Looking to the 4 df column of Appendix Table A.7 and down to the 1.0 row, we see that the entry is.187, so the \(P\)-value \(\approx\).187. This \(P\)-value is clearly larger than any reasonable significance level \(\alpha\) (.01,.05, and even.10), so there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis. The MINITAB output included in Example 9.9 has \(P\)-value \(=\).18. \(P\)-values from software packages will be more accurate than what results from Appendix Table A.7 since values of \(t\) in our table are accurate only to the tenths digit. \(\blacksquare\)

## More on Interpreting \(P\)-Values

The \(P\)-value resulting from carrying out a test on a selected sample is _not_ the probability that \(H_{0}\) is true, nor is it the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. Once again, it is the probability, calculated assuming that \(H_{0}\) is true, of obtaining a test statistic value at least as contradictory to the null hypothesis as the value that actually resulted. For example, consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=50\) against \(H_{0}\): \(\mu<50\) using a lower-tailed \(z\) test. If the calculated value of the test statistic is \(z=-2.00\), then

Figure 9.8: \(P\)-values for \(t\) tests

\[P\mbox{-value} = P(Z<-2.00\mbox{ when }\mu=50)\] \[= \mbox{area under the }z\mbox{ curve to the left of }-2.00=.0228\]

But if a second sample is selected, the resulting value of \(z\) will almost surely be different from \(-2.00\), so the corresponding \(P\)-value will also likely differ from.0228. Because the test statistic value itself varies from one sample to another, the \(P\)-value will also vary from one sample to another. That is, the test statistic is a random variable, and so the \(P\)-value will also be a random variable. A first sample may give a \(P\)-value of.0228, a second sample result in a \(P\)-value of.1175, a third yield.0606 as the \(P\)-value, and so on.

If \(H_{0}\) is false, we hope the \(P\)-value will be close to 0 so that the null hypothesis can be rejected. On the other hand, when \(H_{0}\) is true, we'd like the \(P\)-value to exceed the selected significance level so that the correct decision to not reject \(H_{0}\) is made. The next example presents simulations to show how the \(P\)-value behaves both when the null hypothesis is true and when it is false.

The fuel efficiency (mpg) of any particular new vehicle under specified driving conditions may not be identical to the EPA figure that appears on the vehicle's sticker. Suppose that four different vehicles of a particular type are to be selected and driven over a certain course, after which the fuel efficiency of each one is to be determined. Let \(\mu\) denote the true average fuel efficiency under these conditions.

Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=20\) versus \(H_{0}\): \(\mu>20\) using the one-sample \(t\) test based on the resulting sample. Since the test is based on \(n-1=3\) degrees of freedom, the \(P\)-value for an upper-tailed test is the area under the \(t\) curve with 3 df to the right of the calculated \(t\).

Let's first suppose that the null hypothesis is true. We asked MINITAB to generate 10,000 different samples, each containing 4 observations, from a normal population distribution with mean value \(\mu=20\) and standard deviation \(\sigma=2\). The first sample and resulting summary quantities were

\[x_{1} = 20.830,\ x_{2}=22.232,\ x_{3}=20.276,\ x_{4}=17.718\] \[\pi = 20.264\quad s=1.8864\quad t=\frac{20.264-20}{.1.8864/\sqrt{4}}=.2799\]

The \(P\)-value is the area under the 3-df \(t\) curve to the right of.2799, which according to MINITAB is.3989. Using a significance level of.05, the null hypothesis would of course not be rejected. The values of \(t\) for the next four samples were \(-1.7591\),.6082, \(-.7020\), and 3.1053, with corresponding \(P\)-values.912,.293,.733, and.0265.

Figure 9(a) shows a histogram of the 10,000 \(P\)-values from this simulation experiment. About 4.5% of these \(P\)-values are in the first class interval from 0 to.05. Thus when using a significance level of.05, the null hypothesis is rejected in roughly 4.5% of these 10,000 tests. If we continue to generate samples and carry out the test for each one at significance level.05, in the long run 5% of the \(P\)-values would be in the first class interval--because when \(H_{0}\) is true and a test with significance level.05 is used, by definition the probability of rejecting \(H_{0}\) is.05.

Looking at the histogram, it appears that the distribution of \(P\)-values is relatively flat. In fact, it can be shown that when \(H_{0}\) is true, the probability distribution of the \(P\)-value is a uniform distribution on the interval from 0 to 1. That is, the density curve is completely flat on this interval, and thus must have a Figure 9.9: \(P\)-value simulation results for Example 9.19

height of 1 if the total area under the curve is to be 1. Since the area under such a curve to the left of.05 is (.05)(1) =.05, we again have that the probability of rejecting \(H_{0}\) when it is true is.05, the chosen significance level.

Now consider what happens when \(H_{0}\) is false because \(\mu=21\). We again had MINITAB generate 10,000 different samples of size 4, each from a normal distribution with \(\mu=21\) and \(\sigma=2\), calculate \(t=(\overline{x}-20)/(s/\sqrt{4})\) for each one, and then determine the \(P\)-value. The first such sample resulted in \(\overline{x}=20.6411\), \(s=.49637,\ t=2.5832,\ P\mbox{-value}=.0408\). Figure 9.9(b) gives a histogram of the 10,000 resulting \(P\)-values. The shape of this histogram is quite different from that of Figure 9.9(a): there is a much greater tendency for the \(P\)-value to be small (closer to 0) when \(\mu=21\) than when \(\mu=20\). Again \(H_{0}\) is rejected at significance level.05 whenever the \(P\)-value is at most.05 (in the first class interval). Unfortunately this is the case for only about 19% of the 10,000 \(P\)-values. So only about 19% of the 10,000 tests correctly reject the null hypothesis; for the other 81%, a type II error is committed. The difficulty is that the sample size is quite small and 21 is not very different from the value asserted by the null hypothesis.

Figure 9.9(c) illustrates what happens to the \(P\)-value when \(H_{0}\) is false because \(\mu=22\) (still with \(n=4\) and \(\sigma=2\)). The histogram is even more concentrated toward values close to 0 than was the case when \(\mu=21\). In general, as \(\mu\) moves further to the right of the null value 20, the distribution of the \(P\)-value will become more and more concentrated on values close to 0. Even here a bit fewer than 50% of the 10,000 \(P\)-values are smaller than.05. So it is still slightly more likely than not that the null hypothesis is incorrectly not rejected. Only for values of \(\mu\) much larger than 20 (e.g., at least 24 or 25) is it highly likely that the \(P\)-value will be smaller than.05 and thus give the correct conclusion.

The big idea of this example is that because the value of any test statistic is random, the \(P\)-value will also be a random variable and thus have a distribution. The farther the actual value of the parameter is from the value specified by the null hypothesis, the more the distribution of the \(P\)-value will be concentrated on values close to 0 and the greater the chance that the test will correctly reject \(H_{0}\) (corresponding to smaller \(\beta\)). \(\blacksquare\)

52. An aspirin manufacturer fills bottles by weight rather than by count. Since each bottle should contain 100 tablets, the average weight per tablet should be 5 grains. Each of 100 tablets taken from a very large lot is weighed, resulting in a sample average weight per tablet of 4.87 grains and a sample standard deviation of.35 grain. Does this information provide strong evidence for concluding that the company is not filling its bottles as advertised? Test the appropriate hypotheses using \(\alpha=.01\) by first computing the \(P\)-value and then comparing it to the specified significance level.

Drug Issues_, 1988: 245-257) gives the results of a survey of 102 doctors. Only 47 of those surveyed knew the generic name for the drug methadone. Does this provide strong evidence for concluding that fewer than half of all physicians know the generic name for methadone?

Does this data suggest that the true average percentage of organic matter in such soil is something other than 3%? Carry out a test of the appropriate hypotheses at significance level.10 by first determining the \(P\)-value. Would your conclusion be different if \(\alpha=.05\) had been used?

58. A spectrophotometer used for measuring CO concentration [ppm (parts per million) by volume] is checked for accuracy by taking readings on a manufactured gas (called span gas) in which the CO concentration is very precisely controlled at 70 ppm. If the readings suggest that the spectrophotometer is not working properly, it will have to be recalibrated. Assume that if it is properly calibrated, measured concentration for span gas samples is normally distributed. On the basis of the six readings--85, 77, 82, 68, 72, and 69--is recalibration necessary? Carry out a test of the relevant hypotheses using the _P_-value approach with \(\alpha =.05\).
59. The relative conductivity of a semiconductor device is determined by the amount of impurity "doped" into the device during its manufacture. A silicon diode to be used for a specific purpose requires an average cut-on voltage of.60 V, and if this is not achieved, the amount of impurity must be adjusted. A sample of diodes was selected and the cut-on voltage was determined. The accompanying SAS output resulted from a request to test the appropriate hypotheses.

Also, SAS's _P_-value is always for a two-tailed test.] What would be concluded for a significance level of.01?.05?.10?

## 9.5 Some Comments on Selecting

a Test Procedure

Once the experimenter has decided on the question of interest and the method for gathering data (the design of the experiment), construction of an appropriate test procedure consists of three distinct steps:

1. Specify a test statistic (the decision is based on this function of the data).
2. Decide on the general form of the rejection region (typically, reject \(H_{0}\) for suitably large values of the test statistic, reject for suitably small values, or reject for either small or large values).
3. Select the specific numerical critical value or values that will separate the rejection region from the acceptance region (by obtaining the distribution of the test statistic when \(H_{0}\) is true, and then selecting a level of significance).

In the examples thus far, both steps 1 and 2 were carried out in an ad hoc manner through intuition. For example, when the underlying population was assumed normal with mean \(\mu\) and known \(\sigma\), we were led from \(\overline{X}\) to the standardized test statistic

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\mu_{0}}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}\]

For testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>\mu_{0}\), intuition then suggested rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(z\) was large. Finally, the critical value was determined by specifying the level of significance \(\alpha\) and using the fact that \(Z\) has a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true. The reliability of the test in reaching a correct decision can be assessed by studying type II error probabilities.

Issues to be considered in carrying out steps 1-3 encompass the following questions:

1. What are the practical implications and consequences of choosing a particular level of significance once the other aspects of a test procedure have been determined?
2. Does there exist a general principle, not dependent just on intuition, that can be used to obtain best or good test procedures?
3. When two or more tests are appropriate in a given situation, how can the tests be compared to decide which should be used?
4. If a test is derived under specific assumptions about the distribution or population being sampled, how well will the test procedure work when the assumptions are violated?

### Statistical Versus Practical Significance

Although the process of reaching a decision by using the methodology of classical hypothesis testing involves selecting a level of significance and then rejecting or not rejecting \(H_{0}\) at that level, simply reporting the \(\alpha\) used and the decision reached conveys little of the information contained in the sample data. Especially when the results of an experiment are to be communicated to a large audience, rejection of \(H_{0}\) at level.05 will be much more convincing if the observed value of the test statistic greatly exceeds the 5% critical value than if it barely exceeds that value. This is

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline \(n\) & \(P\)**-value when \(\bar{x}\) = 101** & \(\beta\)**(101) for Level.01 Test** \\ \hline
25 &.3085 &.9664 \\
100 &.1587 &.9082 \\
400 &.0228 &.6293 \\
900 &.0013 &.2514 \\
1600 &.0000335 &.0475 \\
2500 &.00000297 &.0038 \\
10,000 & 7.69 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-24}\) &.0000 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9.1: An illustration of the effect of sample size on \(P\)-values and \(\beta\)precisely what led to the notion of \(P\)-value as a way of reporting significance without imposing a particular \(\alpha\) on others who might wish to draw their own conclusions.

Even if a \(P\)-value is included in a summary of results, however, there may be difficulty in interpreting this value and in making a decision. This is because a small \(P\)-value, which would ordinarily indicate **statistical significance** in that it would strongly suggest rejection of \(H_{0}\) in favor of \(H_{\rm a}\), may be the result of a large sample size in combination with a departure from \(H_{0}\) that has little **practical significance.** In many experimental situations, only departures from \(H_{0}\) of large magnitude would be worthy of detection, whereas a small departure from \(H_{0}\) would have little practical significance.

Consider as an example testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=100\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu>100\) where \(\mu\) is the mean of a normal population with \(\sigma=10\). Suppose a true value of \(\mu=101\) would not represent a serious departure from \(H_{0}\) in the sense that not rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(\mu=101\) would be a relatively inexpensive error. For a reasonably large sample size \(n\), this \(\mu\) would lead to an \(\overline{x}\) value near 101, so we would not want this sample evidence to argue strongly for rejection of \(H_{0}\) when \(\overline{x}=101\) is observed. For various sample sizes, Table 9.1 records both the \(P\)-value when \(\overline{x}=101\) and also the probability of not rejecting \(H_{0}\) at level.01 when \(\mu=101\).

The second column in Table 9.1 shows that even for moderately large sample sizes, the \(P\)-value of \(\overline{x}=101\) argues very strongly for rejection of \(H_{0}\), whereas the observed \(\overline{x}\) itself suggests that in practical terms the true value of \(\mu\) differs little from the null value \(\mu_{0}=100\). The third column points out that even when there is little practical difference between the true \(\mu\) and the null value, for a fixed level of significance a large sample size will almost always lead to rejection of the null hypothesis at that level. To summarize, _one must be especially careful in interpreting evidence when the sample size is large_, _since any small departure from \(H_{0}\) will almost surely be detected by a test, yet such a departure may have little practical significance_.

## Best Tests for Simple Hypotheses

The test procedures presented thus far are (hopefully) intuitively reasonable, but have not been shown to be best in any sense. How can an optimal test be obtained, one for which the type II error probability is as small as possible, subject to controlling the type I error probability at the desired level? Our starting point here will be a rather unrealistic situation from a practical viewpoint: testing a _simple_ null hypothesis against a _simple_ alternative hypothesis. A **simple hypothesis** is one which, when true, completely specifies the distribution of the sample \(X_{i}\)'s. Suppose, for example, that the \(X_{i}\)'s form a random sample from an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda\). Then the hypothesis \(H\): \(\lambda=1\) is simple, since when \(H\) is true each \(X_{i}\) has an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda=1\). We might then consider \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda=1\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\lambda=2\), both of which are simple hypotheses. The hypothesis \(H\): \(\lambda\leq 1\) is not simple, because when \(H\) is true, the distribution of each \(X_{i}\) might be exponential with \(\lambda=1\) or with \(\lambda=.8\) or \(\ldots\). Similarly, if the \(X_{i}\)'s constitute a random sample from a normal distribution with _known_\(\sigma\), then \(H\): \(\mu=100\) is a simple hypothesis. But if the value of \(\sigma\) is unknown, this hypothesis is not simple because the distribution of each \(X_{i}\) is then not completely specified; it could be normal with \(\mu=100\) and \(\sigma=15\) or normal with \(\mu=100\) and \(\sigma=12\) or normal with \(m\) = 100 and any other positive value of \(s\). For a hypothesis to be simple, the value of _every_ parameter in the pmf or pdf of the _X__i_'s must be specified.

The next result was a milestone in the theory of hypothesis testing--a method for constructing a best test for a simple null hypothesis versus a simple alternative hypothesis. Let _f_(_x_1,..., _x__n_; _th_) be the joint pmf or pdf of the _X__i_'s. Then our null hypothesis will assert that _th_ = _th_0 and the relevant alternative hypothesis will claim that _th_ = _th_a. The result will carry over to the case of more than one parameter as long as the value of each parameter is completely specified in both \(H\)0 and _H_a.

For testing a simple null hypothesis \(H\)0: _th_ = _th_0 versus a simple alternative hypothesis _H_a: _th_ = _th_a, let \(k\) be a positive fixed number and form the rejection region

\[R^{*} = \left\{ (x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n}) \colon \frac{f(x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\text{a}})}{f(x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})} \geq k \right\}\]

Thus _R_* is the set of all observations for which the likelihood ratio--ratio of the alternative likelihood to the null likelihood--is at least \(k\). The probability of a type I error for the test with this rejection region is _a_* = _P_[(_X_1,..., \(X_{n}\)) \(\in R^{*}\) when _th_ = _th_0], whereas the type II error probability _b_* is the probability that the _X__i_'s lie in the complement of _R_* (in the "acceptance" region) when _th_ = _th_a.

Then for any other test procedure with type I error probability \(a\) satisfying \(a\) <= _a_*, the probability of a type II error must satisfy \(b\) >= _b_*. Thus the test with rejection region _R_* has the smallest type II error probability among all tests for which the type I error probability is at most _a_*.

The choice of the constant \(k\) in the rejection region will determine the type I error probability _a_*. In the continuous case, \(k\) can be selected to give one of the traditional significance levels.05,.01, and so on, whereas in the discrete case _a_* =.057 or.039 may be as close as one can get to.05.

Consider randomly selecting \(n\) = 5 new vehicles of a certain type and determining the number of major defects on each one. Letting \(X_{i}\) denote the number of such defects for the _i_th selected vehicle (_i_ = 1,..., 5), suppose that the _X__i_'s form a random sample from a Poisson distribution with parameter \(l\). Let's find the best test for testing \(H\)0: \(l\) = 1 versus _H_a: \(l\) = 2. The Poisson likelihood is \(f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{5};\lambda) = e^{- 5\lambda}\;\lambda^{\Sigma x_{i}}/\Pi x_{i}!\). Substituting first \(l\) = 2, then \(l\) = 1, and then taking the ratio of these two likelihoods gives the rejection region

\[R^{*} = \left\{ (x_{1}, \ldots,x_{5}) \colon e^{- 5}2^{\Sigma x_{i}} \geq k \right\}\]

Multiplying both sides of the inequality by \(e\)5 and letting \(k^{\prime} = ke^{5}\) gives the rejection region \(2^{\Sigma x_{i}} \geq k^{\prime}\). Now take the natural logarithm of both sides and let \(c\) = ln(_k_')/ln(2) to obtain the rejection region \(\Sigma x_{i} \geq c\).

This latter rejection region is completely equivalent to _R_*: For any particular value \(k\) there will be a corresponding value \(c\), and vice versa. But it is much easier to express the rejection region in this latter form and then select \(c\) to obtain a desired significance level than it is to determine an appropriate value of \(k\) for the likelihood ratio. In particular, \(T=\Sigma X_{i}\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(5\lambda\) (via a moment generating function argument), so when \(H_{0}\) is true \(T\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter 5. From the 5.0 column of our Poisson table (Table A.2), the cumulative probabilities for the values 8 and 9 are.932 and.968, respectively. Thus if we use \(c=9\) in the rejection region,

\[\alpha^{*}=P(\text{Poisson rv with parameter 5 is }\geq 9)=1-.932=.068\]

Choosing instead \(c=10\) gives \(\alpha^{*}=.032\). If we insist that the significance level be at most.05, then the optimal rejection region is \(\Sigma x_{i}\geq 10\).

When \(H_{\text{a}}\) is true, the test statistic has a Poisson distribution with parameter 10. Thus

\[\beta^{*} =P(H_{0}\text{ is }not\text{ rejected when }H_{\text{a}}\text{ is true})\] \[=P(\text{Poisson rv with parameter 10 is }\leq 9)=.458\]

Obviously this type II error probability is quite large. This is because the sample size \(n=5\) is too small to allow for effective discrimination between \(\lambda=1\) and \(\lambda=2\). For a sample size of 10, the Poisson table reveals that the best test having significance level at most.05 uses \(c=16\), for which \(\alpha^{*}=.049\) (Poisson parameter = 10) and \(\beta^{*}=.157\) (Poisson parameter = 20).

Finally, returning to a sample size of 5, \(c=10\) implies that \(10=\ln(k\epsilon^{5})/\ln(2)\), from which \(k=2^{10}/\epsilon^{5}\approx 6.9\). For the best test to have a significance level of at most.05, the null hypothesis should be rejected only when the likelihood for the alternative value of \(\lambda\) is more than about 7 times what it is for the null value. \(\blacksquare\)

Let \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance 1 (the argument to be given will work for any other known value of \(\sigma^{2}\)). Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu=\mu_{\text{a}}\) where \(\mu_{\text{a}}>\mu_{0}\). The likelihood ratio is

\[\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{n/2}e^{-(1/2)\Sigma(x_{i}-\mu_{\text{a}})^{ 2}}}{\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\right)^{n/2}e^{-(1/2)\Sigma(x_{i}-\mu_{0})^{2}}} =e^{\mu_{\text{a}}\Sigma x_{i}-\mu_{0}\Sigma x_{i}-(n/2)\left(\mu_{ \text{a}}^{2}-\mu_{0}^{2}\right)}\]

\[=\left[e^{-n(\mu_{\text{a}}^{2}-\mu_{0}^{2})/2}\right]\cdot\left[e^{(\mu_{\text {a}}-\mu_{0})\Sigma x_{i}}\right]\]

The term in the first set of brackets is a numerical constant. Then \(\mu_{\alpha}-\mu_{0}>0\) implies that the likelihood ratio will be at least \(k\) if and only if \(\Sigma x_{i}\geq k^{\prime}\), that is, if and only if \(\pi\geq k^{\prime\prime}\), which means if and only if

\[z=\frac{\pi-\mu_{0}}{1/\sqrt{n}}\geq c\]

If we now let \(c=z_{.01}=2.33\), this \(z\) test (one for which the test statistic has a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true), will have minimum \(\beta\) among all tests for which \(\alpha\leq.01\). \(\blacksquare\)

The key idea in these last two examples cannot be overemphasized: Write an expression for the likelihood ratio, and then manipulate the inequality _likelihood ratio_\(\geq k\) so it is equivalent to an inequality involving a test statistic whose distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true is known or can be derived. Then this known or derived distribution can be used to obtain a test with the desired \(\alpha\). In the first example the distribution was Poisson with parameter 5, and in the second it was the standard normal distribution.

**Proof of the Neyman-Pearson Theorem:** We shall consider the case in which the \(X_{i}\)'s have a discrete distribution, so that type I and type II error probabilities are obtained by summation. In the continuous case, integration replaces summation. Then

\[R^{*}=\{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}):\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\rm a})\geq k\cdot f (x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\}\]

\[\alpha^{*}=P[(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\in R^{*}\mbox{ when }\theta=\theta_{0}]=\sum_{R^{*}}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\]

\[\beta^{*}=P[(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\in R^{*\prime}\mbox{ when }\theta=\theta_{\rm a}]=\sum_{R^{*\prime}}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\rm a})\]

(\(\beta^{*}\) is the sum over values in the _complement_ of the rejection region). Suppose that \(R\) is a rejection region different from \(R^{*}\) whose type I error probability is at most \(\alpha^{*}\); that is,

\[\alpha=P[(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n})\in R\mbox{ when }\theta=\theta_{0}]=\sum_{R}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\leq\alpha^{*}\]

We then wish to show that \(\beta\) for this rejection region must be at least as large as \(\beta^{*}\). Consider the difference

\[\Delta= \sum_{R^{*}}\left[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\rm a})-k\cdot f(x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\right]\] \[-\sum_{R}\left[f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\rm a})-k\cdot f(x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\right]\] \[= \sum_{R^{*}\cap R}\left[\ldots\right]+\sum_{R^{*}\cap R^{*}} \left[\ldots\right]-\left\{\sum_{R\cap R^{*}}\left[\ldots\right]+\sum_{R^{*} \cap R^{*}}\left[\ldots\right]\right\}\] \[= \sum_{R^{*}\cap R^{*}}\left[\ldots\right]-\sum_{R^{*}\cap R^{*}} \left[\ldots\right]\] This last difference is nonnegative (i.e. \(\geq 0\)) because the term in the square brackets is \(\geq 0\) for any set of \(x_{i}\)'s in \(R^{*}\) and is negative for any set of \(x_{i}\)'s not in \(R^{*}\). It then follows that

\[0\leq \sum_{R^{*}}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\rm a})-k\ \sum_{R^{*}}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\] \[-\sum_{R}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{\rm a})+k\ \sum_{R}\!f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta_{0})\] \[= (1-\beta^{*})-k\alpha^{*}-(1-\beta)+k\alpha\] \[= \beta-\beta^{*}-k(\alpha^{*}-\alpha)\ \leq\ \beta-\beta^{*}\] \[(\mbox{since }\alpha\leq\alpha^{*}\mbox{ implies that the term being subtracted is nonnegative})\]

Thus we have shown that \(\beta^{*}\leq\beta\) as desired.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:486]

The Neyman-Pearson theorem says that when \(\Omega_{0}\) consists of a single value \(\theta_{0}\) and \(\Omega_{\text{a}}\) also consists of a single value \(\theta_{\text{a}}\), the rejection region \(R^{*}\) specifies a test for which the power \(\pi(\theta_{a})\) at the alternative value \(\theta_{\text{a}}\) (which is just \(1-\beta\)) is maximized subject to \(\pi(\theta_{0})\leq\alpha\) for some specified value of \(\alpha\). That is, \(R^{*}\) specifies a _most powerful test_ subject to the restriction on the power when the null hypothesis is true.

What about best tests when at least one of the two hypotheses is **composite**, that is, \(\Omega_{0}\) or \(\Omega_{a}\) (or both) consist of more than a single value?

Consider again a random sample of size \(n=5\) from a Poisson distribution, and suppose we now wish to test \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda\leq 1\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\lambda>1\). Both of these hypotheses are composite. Arguing as in Example 9.20, for any value \(\lambda_{\text{a}}\) exceeding 1, a most powerful test of \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda=1\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\lambda=\lambda_{\text{a}}\) with significance level (power when \(\lambda=1\)).032 rejects the null hypothesis when \(\Sigma x_{i}\geq 10\). Furthermore, it is easily verified that the power of this test at \(\lambda^{\prime}\) is smaller than.032 if \(\lambda^{\prime}<1\). Thus the test that rejects \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda\leq 1\) in favor of \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda>1\) when \(\Sigma x_{i}\geq 10\) has maximum power for _any_\(\lambda^{\prime}>1\) subject to the condition that \(\pi(\lambda^{\prime})\leq.032\). This test is _uniformly most powerful_. 

More generally, a **uniformly most powerful (UMP) level \(\alpha\) test** is one for which \(\pi(\theta^{\prime})\) is maximized for any \(\theta\in\Omega_{\text{a}}\) subject to \(\pi(\theta^{\prime})\leq\alpha\) for any \(\theta^{\prime}\in\Omega_{0}\). Unfortunately UMP tests are fairly rare, especially in commonly encountered situations when \(H_{0}\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\) are assertions about a single parameter \(\theta_{1}\) whereas the distribution of the \(X_{i}\)'s involves not only \(\theta_{1}\) but also at least one other "nuisance parameter". For example, when the population distribution is normal with values of both \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) unknown, \(\sigma\) is a nuisance parameter when testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\). Be careful here--the null hypothesis is not simple because \(\Omega_{0}\) consists of all pairs (\(\mu\), \(\sigma\)) for which \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) and \(\sigma>0\), and there is certainly more than one such pair. In this situation, the one-sample \(t\) test is not UMP.

Figure 9.10: Graphs of power functions for Example 9.22

However, suppose we restrict attention to **unbiased** tests, those for which the smallest value of \(\pi(\theta^{\prime})\) for \(\theta^{\prime}\in\Omega_{a}\) is at least as large as the largest value of \(\pi(\theta^{\prime})\) for \(\theta^{\prime}\in\Omega_{0}\). Unbiasedness simply says that we are at least as likely to reject the null hypothesis when \(H_{0}\) is false as we are to reject it when \(H_{0}\) is true. The test proposed in Example 9.22 involving paint drying times is unbiased because, as Figure 9.10(b) shows, the power function at or to the right of 75 is smaller than it is to the left of 75. It can be shown that the one-sample \(t\) test is _UMP unbiased_; that is, it is uniformly most powerful among all tests that are unbiased. Several other commonly used tests also have this property. Please consult one of the chapter references for more details.

### Likelihood Ratio Tests

The likelihood ratio (LR) principle is the most frequently used method for finding an appropriate test statistic in a new situation. As before, denote the joint pmf or pdf of \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) by \(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)\). In the case of a random sample, it will be a product \(f(x_{1};\theta)\cdot\cdots\cdot f(x_{n};\theta)\). When the \(x_{i}\)'s are the actual observations and \(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)\) is regarded as a function of \(\theta\), it is called the _likelihood function_. Again consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\theta\in\Omega_{0}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta\in\Omega_{\text{a}}\), where \(\Omega_{0}\) and \(\Omega_{\text{a}}\) are disjoint sets, and let \(\Omega=\Omega_{0}\cup\Omega_{\text{a}}\). In the Neyman-Pearson theorem, we focused on the ratio of the likelihood when \(\theta\in\Omega_{\text{a}}\) to the likelihood when \(\theta\in\Omega_{0}\), rejecting \(H_{0}\) when the value of the ratio was "sufficiently large". Now we consider the ratio of the likelihood when \(\theta\in\Omega_{0}\) to the likelihood when \(\theta\in\Omega\). A very _small_ value of this ratio argues against the null hypothesis, since a small value arises when the data is much more consistent with the alternative hypothesis than with the null hypothesis. More formally,

1. Find the largest value of the likelihood for any \(\theta\in\Omega_{0}\) by finding the maximum likelihood estimate of \(\theta\) within \(\Omega_{0}\) and substituting this mle into the likelihood function to obtain \(L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})\).
2. Find the largest value of the likelihood for any \(\theta\in\Omega\) by finding the maximum likelihood estimate of \(\theta\) within \(\Omega\) and substituting this mle into the likelihood function to obtain \(L(\hat{\Omega})\). Because \(\Omega_{0}\) is a subset of \(\Omega\), this likelihood \(L(\hat{\Omega})\) can't be any smaller than the likelihood \(L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})\) obtained in the first step, and will be much larger when the data is much more consistent with \(H_{\text{a}}\) than with \(H_{0}\).
3. Form the _likelihood ratio_\(L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})/L(\hat{\Omega})\)and reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative when this ratio is \(\leq k\). The critical value \(k\) is chosen to give a test with the desired significance level. In practice, the inequality \(L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})/L(\hat{\Omega})\leq k\) is often re-expressed in terms of a more convenient statistic (such as the sum of the observations) whose distribution is known or can be derived. The above prescription remains valid if the single parameter \(\theta\) is replaced by several parameters \(\theta_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{k}\). The mle's of all parameters must be obtained in both steps 1 and 2 and substituted back into the likelihood function.

Consider a random sample from a normal distribution with the values of both parameters unknown. We wish to test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\). Here \(\Omega\) consists of all values of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma^{2}\) for which \(-\infty<\mu<\infty\) and \(\sigma^{2}>0\), and the likelihood function is

\[\left(\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^{2}}\right)^{n/2}e^{-1/(2\sigma^{2})\sum{(x_{i}-\mu )^{2}}}\]In Section 7.2 we obtained the mle's as \(\hat{\mu}=\uppi,\ \hat{\sigma}^{2}=\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}/n\). Substituting these estimates back into the likelihood function gives

\[L(\hat{\Omega})=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}/n}\right)^{ n/2}e^{-n/2}\]

Within \(\Omega_{0}\), \(\mu\) in the foregoing likelihood is replaced by \(\mu_{0}\), so that only \(\sigma^{2}\) must be estimated. It is easily verified that the mle is \(\hat{\sigma}^{2}=\sum\left(x_{i}-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}/n\). Substitution of this estimate in the likelihood function yields

\[L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})=\left(\frac{1}{2\pi\sum\left(x_{i}-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}/n} \right)^{n/2}e^{-n/2}\]

Thus we reject \(H_{0}\) in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\) when

\[\frac{L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})}{L(\hat{\Omega})}=\left(\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi \right)^{2}}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}}\right)^{n/2}\leq k\]

Raising both sides of this inequality to the power \(2/n\), we reject \(H_{0}\) whenever

\[\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}} \leq k^{2/n}=k^{\prime}\]

This is intuitively quite reasonable: the value \(\mu_{0}\) is implausible for \(\mu\) if the sum of squared deviations about the sample mean is much smaller than the sum of squared deviations about \(\mu_{0}\). The denominator of this latter ratio can be expressed as

\[\sum\left[\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)+\left(\uppi-\mu_{0}\right)\right]^{2}=\sum \left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}+2\sum\left(\uppi-\mu_{0}\right)\left(x_{i}- \uppi\right)+n\left(\uppi-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}\]

The middle (i.e., cross-product) term in this expression is \(0\), because the constant \(\uppi-\mu_{0}\) can be moved outside the summation, and then the sum of deviations from the sample mean is \(0\). Thus we should reject \(H_{0}\) when

\[\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}+n \left(\uppi-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{1+n\left(\uppi-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}/ \sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}}\leq k^{\prime}\]

This latter ratio will be small when the second term in the denominator is large, so the condition for rejection becomes

\[\frac{n\left(\uppi-\mu_{0}\right)^{2}}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\uppi\right)^{2}}\geq k ^{\prime\prime}\]

Dividing both sides by \(n-1\) and taking square roots gives the rejection region

\[\text{either }\frac{\uppi-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}}\geq c\quad\text{or}\quad\frac{ \uppi-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{n}}\leq-c\]

If we now let \(c=t_{\uppi/2,n-1}\), we have exactly the two-tailed one-sample \(t\) test. The bottom line is that when testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) against the two-sided (\(\neq\)) alternative, the one-sample \(t\) test is the likelihood ratio test. This is also true of the upper-tailed version of the \(t\) test when the alternative is \(H_{a^{\prime}}\): \(\mu>\mu_{0}\) and of the lower-tailed test when the alternative is \(H_{a^{\prime}}\): \(\mu<\mu_{0}\). We could trace back through the argument to recover the critical constant \(k\) from \(c\), but there is no point in doing this; the rejection region in terms of \(t\) is much more convenient than the rejection region in terms of the likelihood ratio.

A number of tests discussed subsequently, including the "pooled" \(t\) test from the next chapter and various tests from ANOVA (the analysis of variance) and regression analysis, can be derived by the likelihood ratio principle. Rather frequently the inequality for the rejection region of a likelihood ratio test cannot be manipulated to express the test procedure in terms of a simple statistic whose distribution can be ascertained. The following large-sample result, valid under fairly general conditions, can then be used: If the sample size \(n\) is sufficiently large, then the statistic \(-2\)[ln(likelihood ratio)] has approximately a chi-squared distribution with \(v\) degrees of freedom, where \(v\) is the difference between the number of "freely varying" parameters in \(\Omega\) and the number of such parameters in \(\Omega_{0}\). For example, if the distribution sampled is bivariate normal with the 5 parameters \(\mu_{1}\), \(\mu_{2}\), \(\sigma_{1}\), \(\sigma_{2}\), and \(\rho\) and the null hypothesis asserts that \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\) and \(\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}\), then \(v=5-3=2\). By definition \(L(\hat{\Omega}_{0})/L(\hat{\Omega})\leq 1\), and the likelihood ratio test rejects \(H_{0}\) when this likelihood ratio is much less than 1. This is equivalent to rejecting when the logarithm of the likelihood ratio is quite negative, that is, when \(-\)ln(LR) is quite positive. The large-sample version of the test is thus upper-tailed: \(H_{0}\) should be rejected if \(-2\)ln(likelihood ratio) \(\geq\chi^{2}_{x,v}\) (an upper-tail critical value extracted from Table A.6).

Suppose a scientist makes \(n\) measurements of some physical characteristic, such as the specific gravity of a liquid. Let \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{n}\) denote the resulting measurement errors. Assume that these \(X_{i}\)'s are independent and identically distributed according to the double exponential (Laplace) distribution: \(f(x)=.5e^{-|x-\theta|}\) for \(-\infty<\)x\(<\)\(\infty\). This pdf is symmetric about \(\theta\) with somewhat heavier tails than the normal pdf. If \(\theta=0\) then the measurements are unbiased, so it is natural to test \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=0\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\theta\neq 0\). Here \(v=1-0=1\). The likelihood is

\[L(\theta)=(.5)^{n}e^{-\sum|x_{i}-\theta|}\]

Because of the minus sign preceding the summation, the likelihood is maximized when \(\sum|x_{i}-\theta|\) is minimized. The absolute value function is not differentiable, and therefore differential calculus cannot be used. Instead, consider for a moment the case \(n=5\) and let \(y_{1}\),..., \(y_{5}\) denote the values of the \(x_{i}\)'s ordered from smallest to largest--so the \(y_{i}\)'s are the observed values of the order statistics. For example, a random sample of size five from the Laplace distribution with \(\theta=0\) is \(-.24998\), \(.75446\), \(-.19053\), \(1.16237\), \(.83229\), so (\(y_{1}\),..., \(y_{5}\)) = (\(-.24998\), \(-.19053\), \(.75446\), \(.83229\), \(1.16237\)). Then

\[\sum|x_{i}-\theta|=\sum|y_{i}-\theta|=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{ 3}+y_{4}+y_{5}-5\theta&\theta<y_{1}\\ -y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}-3\theta&y_{1}\leq\theta<y_{2}\\ -y_{1}-y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}-\theta&y_{2}\leq\theta<y_{3}\\ -y_{1}-y_{2}-y_{3}+y_{4}+y_{5}+\theta&y_{3}\leq\theta<y_{4}\\ -y_{1}-y_{2}-y_{3}-y_{4}+y_{5}+3\theta&y_{4}\leq\theta<y_{5}\\ -y_{1}-y_{2}-y_{3}-y_{4}-y_{5}+5\theta&\theta\geq y_{5}\end{array}\right.\]

The graph of this expression as a function of \(\theta\) appears in Figure 9.11, from which it is apparent that the minimum occurs at \(y_{3}=\tilde{x}=.75446\), the sample median. The situation is similar whenever \(n\) is odd. When \(n\) is even, the function achieves its minimum for any \(\theta\) between \(y_{n/2}\) and \(y_{(n/2)+1}\); one such \(\theta\)_is_\((y_{n/2}+y_{(n/2)+1})/2=\tilde{x}\). In summary, the mle of \(\theta\) is the sample median.

The likelihood ratio statistic for testing the relevant hypotheses is \((.5)^{n}e^{-\Sigma|x_{i}|}/[(.5)^{n}e^{-\Sigma|x_{i}-\tilde{x}|}]\). Taking the natural log of the likelihood ratio and multiplying by \(-2\) gives the rejection region \(2\sum|x_{i}|-2\sum|x_{i}-\tilde{x}|\geq\gamma_{\alpha,1}^{2}\) for the large-sample version of the LR test.

Suppose that a sample of \(n=30\) errors results in \(\sum|x_{i}|=38.6\) and \(\sum|x_{i}-\tilde{x}|=37.3\). Then

\[-2\ln(LR)=2\Bigl{(}\sum|x_{i}|-\sum|x_{i}-\tilde{x}|\Bigr{)}=2.6\]

Comparing this to \(\chi^{2}_{.05,1}=3.84\), we would not reject the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level. It is plausible that the measurement process is indeed unbiased. \(\blacksquare\)

**a.**: Show that the most powerful test for \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=1\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\theta=2\) rejects the null hypothesis if \(\Sigma\)ln(\(x_{i})\geq c\).
**b.**: Is the test of (a) UMP for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=1\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\theta>1\)? Explain your reasoning.
**c.**: If \(n=50\), what is the (approximate) value of \(c\) for which the test has significance level.05?
**65.**: Consider a random sample of \(n\) component lifetimes, where the distribution of lifetime is exponential with parameter \(\lambda\).
**a.**: Obtain a most powerful test for \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda=1\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\lambda=.5\), and express the rejection region in terms of a "simple" statistic.
**b.**: Is the test of (a) uniformly most powerful for \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda=1\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\lambda<1\)? Justify your answer.
**66.**: Consider a random sample of size \(n\) from the "shifted exponential" distribution with pdf \(f(x;\theta)=e^{-(x-\theta)}\) for \(x>\theta\) and \(0\) otherwise (the graph is that of the ordinary exponential pdf with \(\lambda=1\) shifted so that it begins its descent at \(\theta\) rather than at 0). Let \(Y_{1}\) denote the smallest order statistic, and show that the likelihood ratio test of \(H_{0}\): \(\theta\leq 1\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\theta>1\) rejects the null hypothesis if \(y_{1}\), the observed value of \(Y_{1}\), is \(\geq c\).
**67.**: Suppose that each of \(n\) randomly selected individuals is classified according to his/her genotype with respect to a particular genetic characteristic and that the three possible genotypes are AA, Aa, and aa with long-run proportions (probabilities) \(\theta^{2}\), \(2\theta(1-\theta)\), and (\(1-\theta)^{2}\), respectively (\(0<\theta<1\)). It is then straightforward to show that the likelihood is

\[\theta^{2x_{1}}\cdot[2\theta(1-\theta)]^{x_{2}}\cdot(1-\theta)^{2x_{3}}\]

where \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), and \(x_{3}\) are the number of individuals in the sample who have the AA, Aa, and aa genotypes, respectively. Show that the most powerful test for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=.5\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\theta=.8\) rejects the null hypothesis when \(2x_{1}+x_{2}\geq c\). Is this test UMP for the alternative \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\theta>.5\)? Explain. [_Note_: The fact that the joint distribution of \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), and \(X_{3}\) is multinomial can be used to obtain the value of \(c\) that yields a test with any desired significance level when \(n\) is large.]
**68.**: The error in a measurement is normally distributed with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation 1. Consider a random sample of \(n\) errors, and show that the likelihood ratio test for \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=0\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu\neq 0\) rejects the null hypothesis when either \(\overline{x}\geq c\) or \(\overline{x}\leq-c\). What is \(c\) for a test with \(\alpha=.05\)? How does the test change if the standard deviation of an error is \(\sigma_{0}\) (known) and the relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=0\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu\neq\)\(\mu_{0}\)?
**69.**: Measurement error in a particular situation is normally distributed with mean value \(\mu\) and standard deviation 4. Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=0\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu\neq 0\) based on a sample of \(n=16\) measurements.
**a.**: Verify that the usual test with significance level.05 rejects \(H_{0}\) if either \(\overline{x}\geq 1.96\) or\(\begin{array}{l}\pi\leq-1.96\). [_Note_: That this test is unbiased follows from the fact that the way to capture the largest area under the \(z\) curve above an interval having width 3.92 is to center that interval at 0 (so it extends from \(-1.96\) to 1.96).] **b.**: Consider the test that rejects \(H_{0}\) if either \(\pi\geq 2.17\) or \(\pi\leq-1.81\). What is \(\alpha\), that is, \(\pi\)(0)? **c.**: What is the power of the test proposed in (b) when \(\mu=.1\) and when \(\mu=-.17\) (Note that \(.1\) and \(-.1\) are very close to the null value, so one would not expect large power for such values). Is the test unbiased? **d.**: Calculate the power of the usual test when \(\mu=.1\) and when \(\mu=-.1\). Is the usual test a most powerful test? [_Hint_: Refer to your calculations in (c).] [_Note_: It can be shown that the usual test is most powerful among all unbiased tests.]
**70.**: A test of whether a coin is fair will be based on \(n=50\) tosses. Let \(X\) be the resulting number of heads. Consider two rejection regions: \(R_{1}=\{x\): either \(x\leq 17\) or \(x\geq 33\}\) and \(R_{2}=\{x\): either \(x\leq 18\) or \(x\geq 37\}\).

Test the appropriate hypotheses using \(\alpha=.05\).
**78.**: The article "Caffeine Knowledge, Attitudes, and Consumption in Adult Women" (_J. Nutrit. Ed._, 1992: 179-184) reports the following summary data on daily caffeine consumption for a sample of adult women: \(n=47\), \(\overline{x}=215\) mg, \(s=235\) mg, and range \(=5-1176\).
**a.**: Does it appear plausible that the population distribution of daily caffeine consumption is normal? Is it necessary to assume a normal population distribution to test hypotheses about the value of the population mean consumption? Explain your reasoning.

**80.**: The true average breaking strength of ceramic insulators of a certain type is supposed to be at least 10 psi. They will be used for a particular application unless sample data indicates conclusively that this specification has not been met. A test of hypotheses using \(\alpha=.01\) is to be based on a random sample of ten insulators. Assume that the breaking-strength distribution is normal with unknown standard deviation.
**a.**: If the true standard deviation is.80, how likely is it that insulators will be judged satisfactory when true average breaking strength is actually only 9.5? Only 9.0?

**81.**: The accompanying observations on residual flame time (sec) for strips of treated children's nightwear were given in the article "An Introduction to Some Precision and Accuracy of Measurement Problems" (_J. Test. Eval._, 1982: 132-140). Suppose a true average flame time of at most 9.75 had been mandated. Does the data suggest that this condition has not been met? Carry out an appropriate test after first investigating the plausibility of assumptions that underlie your method of inference.

**82.**: The incidence of a certain type of chromosome defect in the U.S. adult male population is believed to be 1 in 75. A random sample of 800 individuals in U.S. penal institutions reveals 16 who have such defects. Can it be concluded that the incidence rate of this defect among prisoners differs from the presumed rate for the entire adult male population?
**a.**: State and test the relevant hypotheses using \(\alpha=.05\). What type of error might you have made in reaching a conclusion?
**b.**: What \(P\)-value is associated with this test? Based on this \(P\)-value, could \(H_{0}\) be rejected at significance level.20?
**83.**: In an investigation of the toxin produced by a certain poisonous snake, a researcher prepared 26different vials, each containing 1 g of the toxin, and then determined the amount of antitoxin needed to neutralize the toxin. The sample average amount of antitoxin necessary was found to be 1.89 mg, and the sample standard deviation was.42. Previous research had indicated that the true average neutralizing amount was 1.75 mg/g of toxin. Does the new data contradict the value suggested by prior research? Test the relevant hypotheses using the _P_-value approach. Does the validity of your analysis depend on any assumptions about the population distribution of neutralizing amount? Explain.
84. The sample average unrestrained compressive strength for 45 specimens of a particular type of brick was computed to be 3107 psi, and the sample standard deviation was 188. The distribution of unrestrained compressive strength may be somewhat skewed. Does the data strongly indicate that the true average unrestrained compressive strength is less than the design value of 3200? Test using \(\alpha=.001\).
85. To test the ability of auto mechanics to identify simple engine problems, an automobile with a single such problem was taken in turn to 72 different car repair facilities. Only 42 of the 72 mechanics who worked on the car correctly identified the problem. Does this strongly indicate that the true proportion of mechanics who could identify this problem is less than.75? Compute the _P_-value and reach a conclusion accordingly.
86. When \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) are independent Poisson variables, each with parameter \(\lambda\), and \(n\) is large, the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) has approximately a normal distribution with \(\mu=E(\overline{X})=\lambda\) and \(\sigma^{2}=V(\overline{X})=\lambda/n\). This implies that \[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda/n}}\] has approximately a standard normal distribution. For testing \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda=\lambda_{0}\), we can replace \(\lambda\) by \(\lambda_{0}\) in the equation for \(Z\) to obtain a test statistic. This statistic is actually preferred to the large-sample statistic with denominator \(S/\sqrt{n}\) (when the \(X_{i}\)'s are Poisson) because it is tailored explicitly to the Poisson assumption. If the number of requests for consulting received by a certain statistician during a 5-day work week has a Poisson distribution and the total number of consulting requests during a 36-week period is 160, does this suggest that the true average number of weekly requests exceeds 4.0? Test using \(\alpha=.02\).
87. A hot-tub manufacturer advertises that with its heating equipment, a temperature of 100\({}^{\circ}\)F can be achieved in at most 15 min. A random sample of 32 tubs is selected, and the time necessary to achieve a 100\({}^{\circ}\)F temperature is determined for each tub. The sample average time and sample standard deviation are 17.5 min and 2.2 min, respectively. Does this data cast doubt on the company's claim? Compute the _P_-value and use it to reach a conclusion at level.05 (assume that the heating-time distribution is approximately normal).
88. Chapter 8 presented a CI for the variance \(\sigma^{2}\) of a normal population distribution. The key result there was that the rv \(\chi^{2}=(n-1)S^{2}/\sigma^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(n-1\) df. Consider the null hypothesis \(H_{0}:\ \sigma^{2}=\sigma_{0}^{2}\) (equivalently, \(\sigma=\sigma_{0}\)). Then when \(H_{0}\) is true, the test statistic \(\chi^{2}=(n-1)S^{2}/\sigma_{0}^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(n-1\) df. If the relevant alternative is \(H_{\text{a}}:\ \sigma^{2}>\sigma_{0}^{2}\), rejecting \(H_{0}\) if \((n-1)S^{2}/\sigma_{0}^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{\text{a},n-1}\) gives a test with significance level \(\alpha\). To ensure reasonably uniform characteristics for a particular application, it is desired that the true standard deviation of the softening point of a certain type of petroleum pitch be at most.50\({}^{\circ}\)C. The softening points of ten different specimens were determined, yielding a sample standard deviation of.58\({}^{\circ}\)C. Does this strongly contradict the uniformity specification? Test the appropriate hypotheses using \(\alpha=.01\).
89. Referring to Exercise 88, suppose an investigator wishes to test \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma^{2}=.04\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\sigma^{2}<.04\) based on a sample of 21 observations. The computed value of 20s\({}^{2}\)/.04 is 8.58. Place bounds on the _P_-value and then reach a conclusion at level.01.
90. When the population distribution is normal and \(n\) is large, the sample standard deviation \(S\) has approximately a normal distribution with \(E(S)\approx\sigma\) and \(V(S)\approx\sigma^{2}/(2n)\). We already know that in this case, for any \(n\), \(\overline{X}\) is normal with \(E(\overline{X})=\mu\) and \(V(\overline{X})=\sigma^{2}/n\). 10. Assuming that the underlying distribution is normal, what is an approximately unbiased estimator of the 99th percentile \(\theta=\mu+2.33\sigma\)? 10. As discussed in Section 6.4, when the \(X_{i}\)'s are normal \(\overline{X}\) and \(S\) are independent rv's (one measures location whereas the other measuresspread). Use this to compute \(V(\hat{\theta})\) and \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) for the estimator \(\hat{\theta}\) of part (a). What is the estimated standard error \(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}\)? **c.** Write a test statistic for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\theta=\theta_{0}\) that has approximately a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true. If soil pH is normally distributed in a certain region and 64 soil samples yield \(\pi=6.33\), \(s=.16\), does this provide strong evidence for concluding that at most 99% of all possible samples would have a pH of less than 6.75? Test using \(\alpha=.01\).
91. Let \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) be a random sample from an exponential distribution with parameter \(\lambda\). Then it can be shown that \(2\lambda\Sigma X_{i}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(v=2n\)(by first showing that \(2\lambda X_{i}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(v=2\)). **a.** Use this fact to obtain a test statistic and rejection region that together specify a level \(\alpha\) test for \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus each of the three commonly encountered alternatives. [_Hint_: \(E(X_{i})=\mu=1/\lambda\), so \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) is equivalent to \(\lambda=1/\mu_{0}\). **b.** Suppose that ten identical components, each having exponentially distributed time until failure, are tested. The resulting failure times are 95 16 11 3 42 71 225 64 87 123 Use the test procedure of part (a) to decide whether the data strongly suggests that the true average lifetime is less than the previously claimed value of 75.
92. Suppose the population distribution is normal with known \(\sigma\). Let \(\gamma\) be such that \(0<\gamma<\alpha\). For testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\), consider the test that rejects \(H_{0}\) if either \(z\geq z\), or \(z\leq-z_{2-\gamma}\), where the test statistic is \(Z=(\overline{X}-\mu_{0})/(\sigma/\sqrt{n})\). **a.** Show that \(P(\text{type I error})=\alpha\). **b.** Derive an expression for \(\beta(u^{\prime})\). [_Hint_: Express the test in the form "reject \(H_{0}\) if either \(\pi\geq c_{1}\) or \(\leq c_{2}\)."] **c.** Let \(\Delta>0\). For what values of \(\gamma\) (relative to \(\alpha\)) will \(\beta(\mu_{0}+\Delta)<\beta(\mu_{0}-\Delta)\)?
93. After a period of apprenticeship, an organization gives an exam that must be passed to be eligible for membership. Let \(p=P(\text{randomly chosen apprentice passes})\). The organization wishes an exam that most but not all should be able to pass, so it decides that \(p=.90\) is desirable. For a particular exam, the relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(p=.90\) versus the alternative \(H_{\alpha}\): \(p\neq.90\). Suppose ten people take the exam, and let \(X=\) the number who pass. **a.** Does the lower-tailed region {0, 1,..., 5} specify a level.01 test? **b.** Show that even though \(H_{\alpha}\) is two-sided, no two-tailed test is a level.01 test. **c.** Sketch a graph of \(\beta(p^{\prime})\) as a function of \(p^{\prime}\) for this test. Is this desirable?
94. A service station has six gas pumps. When no vehicles are at the station, let \(p_{i}\) denote the probability that the next vehicle will select pump \(i\) (\(i=1\), \(2\),..., 6). Based on a sample of size \(n\), we wish to test \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=\ldots=p_{6}\) versus the alternative \(H_{\alpha}\): \(p_{1}=p_{3}=p_{5}\), \(p_{2}=p_{4}=p_{6}\) (note that \(H_{\alpha}\) is not a simple hypothesis). Let \(X\) be the number of customers in the sample that select an even-numbered pump. **a.** Show that the likelihood ratio test rejects \(H_{0}\) if either \(X\geq c\) or \(X\leq n-c\). [_Hint_: When \(H_{\alpha}\) is true, let \(\theta\) denote the common value of \(p_{2}\), \(p_{4}\), and \(p_{6}\).] **b.** Let \(n=10\) and \(c=9\). Determine the power of the test both when \(H_{0}\) is true and also when \(p_{2}=p_{4}=p_{6}=\frac{1}{10}\), \(p_{1}=p_{3}=p_{5}=\frac{7}{30}\).

## Chapter 1 Introduction

Chapters 8 and 9 presented confidence intervals (CIs) and hypothesis testing procedures for a single mean \(\mu\), single proportion \(p\), and a single variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Here we extend these methods to situations involving the means, proportions, and variances of two different population distributions. For example, let \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) denote true average decrease in cholesterol for two drugs. Then an investigator might wish to use results from patients assigned at random to two different groups as a basis for testing the hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\) versus the alternative hypothesis \(H_{a}\): \(\mu_{1}\neq\mu_{2}\). As another example, let \(p_{1}\) denote the true proportion of all Catholics who plan to vote for the Republican candidate in the next presidential election, and let \(p_{2}\) represent the true proportion of all Protestants who plan to vote Republican. Based on a survey of 500 Catholics and 500 Protestants we might like an interval estimate for the difference \(p_{1}-p_{2}\).

10.1 \(z\) Tests and Confidence Intervals for a Difference Between Two Population Means

The inferences discussed in this section concern a difference \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) between the means of two different population distributions. An investigator might, for example, wish to test hypotheses about the difference between the true average weight losses of two diets. One such hypothesis would state that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\), that is, that \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\). Alternatively, it may be appropriate to estimate \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) by computing a 95% CI. Such inferences are based on a sample of weight losses for each diet.

\begin{tabular}{l p{227.6pt}} BASIC & **1.**\(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{m}\) is a random sample from a population with mean \(\mu_{1}\) and variance \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\). \\  & **2.**\(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\),..., \(Y_{n}\) is a random sample from a population with mean \(\mu_{2}\) and variance \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\). \\  & **3.** The \(X\) and \(Y\) samples are independent of each other. \\ \end{tabular}

The natural estimator of \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) is \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\), the difference between the corresponding sample means. The test statistic results from standardizing this estimator, so we need expressions for the expected value and standard deviation of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\).

\begin{tabular}{l p{227.6pt}} PROPOSITION & The expected value of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) is \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\), so \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\). The standard deviation of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) is \\  & \(\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_ {2}^{2}}{n}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

* Both these results depend on the rules of expected value and variance presented in Chapter 6. Since the expected value of a difference is the difference of expected values, \[E(\overline{X}-\overline{Y})=E(\overline{X})-E(\overline{Y})=\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\] Because the \(X\) and \(Y\) samples are independent, \(\overline{X}\) and \(\overline{Y}\) are independent quantities, so the variance of the difference is the _sum_ of \(V(\overline{X})\) and \(V(\overline{Y})\): \[V(\overline{X}-\overline{Y})=V(\overline{X})+V(\overline{Y})=\frac{\sigma_{1 }^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}\] The standard deviation of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) is the square root of this expression.

If we think of \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) as a parameter \(\theta\), then its estimator is \(\hat{\theta}=\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) with standard deviation \(\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\) given by the proposition. When \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\) both have known values, the test statistic will have the form \((\hat{\theta}-\mbox{ null value})/\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\); this form of a test statistic was used in several one-sample problems in the previous chapter. When \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\) are unknown, the sample variances must be used to estimate \(\sigma_{\hat{\rho}}\).

## Test Procedures for Normal Populations

with Known Variances

In Chapters 8 and 9, the first CI and test procedure for a population mean \(\mu\) were based on the assumption that the population distribution was normal with the value of the population variance \(\sigma^{2}\) known to the investigator. Similarly, we first assume here that _both_ population distributions are normal and that the values of _both_\(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\) are known. Situations in which one or both of these assumptions can be dispensed with will be presented shortly.

Because the population distributions are normal, both \(\overline{X}\) and \(\overline{Y}\) have normal distributions. This implies that \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) is normally distributed, with expected value \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}\) given in the foregoing proposition. Standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) gives the standard normal variable

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{ 2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}} \tag{10.1}\]

In a hypothesis-testing problem, the null hypothesis will state that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) has a specified value. Denoting this null value by \(\Delta_{0}\), the null hypothesis becomes \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\). Often \(\Delta_{0}=0\), in which case \(H_{0}\) says that \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\). A test statistic results from replacing \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) in Expression (10.1) by the null value \(\Delta_{0}\). Because the test statistic \(Z\) is obtained by standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) under the assumption that \(H_{0}\) is true, it has a standard normal distribution in this case. Consider the alternative hypothesis \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>\Delta_{0}\). A value \(\upalpha-\upgamma\) that considerably exceeds \(\Delta_{0}\) (the expected value of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true) provides evidence against \(H_{0}\) and for \(H_{\text{a}}\). Such a value of \(\upalpha-\overline{y}\) corresponds to a positive and large value of \(z\). Thus \(H_{0}\) should be rejected in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\) if \(z\) is greater than or equal to an appropriately chosen critical value. Because the test statistic \(Z\) has a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true, the upper-tailed rejection region \(z\geq z_{\text{a}}\) gives a test with significance level (type I error probability) \(\upalpha\). Rejection regions for the other alternatives \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<\Delta_{0}\) and \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq\Delta_{0}\) that yield tests with desired significance level \(\upalpha\) are lower-tailed and two-tailed, respectively.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\): & \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) \\ Test statistic value: & \(z=\frac{\upalpha-\upgamma-\Delta_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{ \sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}}\) \\ Alternative Hypothesis & **Rejection Region for Level \(\upalpha\) Test** \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): & \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>\Delta_{0}\) & \(z\geq z_{\text{a}}\) (upper-tailed test) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): & \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<\Delta_{0}\) & \(z\leq-z_{\text{a}}\) (lower-tailed test) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): & \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq\Delta_{0}\) & either \(z\geq z_{\text{a/2}}\) or \(z\leq-z_{\text{a/2}}\) (two-tailed test) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Because these are \(z\) tests, a \(P\)-value is computed as it was for the \(z\) tests in Chapter 9 [e.g., \(P\)-value \(=\) 1 \(-\)\(\Phi(z)\) for an upper-tailed test].

Each student in a class of 21 responded to a questionnaire that requested their grade point average (GPA) and the number of hours each week that they studied. For those who studied less than 10 h/week the GPAs were

\[2.80\quad 3.40\quad 4.00\quad 3.60\quad 2.00\quad 3.00\quad 3.47\quad 2.80 \quad 2.60\quad 2.00\]

and for those who studied at least 10 h/week the GPAs were

\[3.00\quad 3.00\quad 2.20\quad 2.40\quad 4.00\quad 2.96\quad 3.41\quad 3.27 \quad 3.80\quad 3.10\quad 2.50\]

Normal plots for both sets are reasonably linear, so the normality assumption is tenable. Because the standard deviation of GPAs for the whole campus is.6, it is reasonable to apply that value here. The sample means are 2.97 for the \(<\)10 study hours group and 3.06 for the \(\geq\)10 study hours group. Treating the two samples as random, is there evidence that true average GPA differs for the two study times? Let's carry out a test of significance at level.05.

1. The parameter of interest is \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\), the difference between true mean GPA for the \(<\) 10 (conceptual) population and true mean GPA for the \(\geq\)10 population.
2. The null hypothesis is \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\).
3. The alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq 0\); if \(H_{\text{a}}\) is true then \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) are different. Although it would seem unlikely that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0\) (those with low study hours have higher mean GPA) we will allow it as a possibility and do a two-tailed test.
4. With \(\Delta_{0}=0\), the test statistic value is \[z=\frac{\overline{x}-\overline{y}}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{ \sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}}\]
5. The inequality in \(H_{\text{a}}\) implies that the test is two-tailed. For \(\alpha=.05\), \(\alpha/2=.025\) and \(z_{\alpha/2}=z_{.025}=1.96\). \(H_{0}\) will be rejected if \(z\geq 1.96\) or \(z\leq-1.96\).
6. Substituting \(m=10\), \(\overline{x}=2.97\), \(\sigma_{1}^{2}=.36\), \(n=11\), \(\overline{y}=3.06\), and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}=.36\) into the formula for \(z\) yields \[z=\frac{2.97-3.06}{\sqrt{\frac{36}{10}+\frac{.36}{11}}}=\frac{-.09}{.262}=-.34\] That is, the value of \(\overline{x}-\overline{y}\) is only one-third of a standard deviation below what would be expected when \(H_{0}\) is true.
7. Because the value of \(z\) is not even close to the rejection region, there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis. This test shows no evidence of any relationship between study hours and GPA.

## Using a Comparison to Identify Causality

Investigators are often interested in comparing either the effects of two different treatments on a response or the response after treatment with the response after no treatment (treatment vs. control). If the individuals or objects to be used in the comparison are not assigned by the investigators to the two different conditions, the study is said to be **observational**. The difficulty with drawing conclusions based on an observational study is that although statistical analysis may indicate a significant difference in response between the two groups, the difference may be due to some underlying factors that had not been controlled rather than to any difference in treatments.

A letter in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_ (May 19, 1978) reports that of 215 male physicians who were Harvard graduates and died between November 1974 and October 1977, the 125 in full-time practice lived an average of 48.9 years beyond graduation, whereas the 90 with academic affiliations lived an average of 43.2 years beyond graduation. Does the data suggest that the mean lifetime after graduation for doctors in full-time practice exceeds the mean lifetime for those who have an academic affiliation (if so, those medical students who say that they are "dying to obtain an academic affiliation" may be closer to the truth than they realize; in other words, is "publish or perish" really "publish and perish")?

Let \(\mu_{1}\) denote the true average number of years lived beyond graduation for physicians in full-time practice, and let \(\mu_{2}\) denote the same quantity for physicians with academic affiliations. Assume the 125 and 90 physicians to be random samples from populations 1 and 2, respectively (which may not be reasonable if there is reason to believe that Harvard graduates have special characteristics that differentiate them from all other physicians--in this case inferences would be restricted just to the "Harvard populations"). The letter from which the data was taken gave no information about variances, so for illustration assume that \(\sigma_{1}=14.6\) and \(\sigma_{2}=14.4\). The relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0\), so \(\Delta_{0}\) is zero. The computed value of \(z\) is

\[z=\frac{48.9-43.2}{\sqrt{\frac{(14.6)^{2}}{125}+\frac{(14.4)^{2}}{90}}}=\frac{5.70}{\sqrt{1.70+2.30}}=2.85\]

The _P_-value for an upper-tailed test is \(1-\Phi(2.85)=.0022\). At significance level.01, \(H_{0}\) is rejected (because \(\alpha\geq P\)-value) in favor of the conclusion that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0\) (\(\mu_{1}>\mu_{2}\)). This is consistent with the information reported in the letter.

This data resulted from a **retrospective** observational study; the investigator did not start out by selecting a sample of doctors and assigning some to the "academic affiliation" treatment and the others to the "full-time practice" treatment, but instead identified members of the two groups by looking backward in time (through obituaries!) to past records. Can the statistically significant result here really be attributed to a difference in the type of medical practice after graduation, or is there some other underlying factor (e.g., age at graduation, exercise regimens, etc.) that might also furnish a plausible explanation for the difference?

Once upon a time, it could be argued that the studies linking smoking and lung cancer were all observational, and therefore that nothing had been proved.

This was the view of the great (perhaps the greatest) statistician R. A. Fisher, who maintained till his death in 1962 that the observational studies did not show causation. He said that people who choose to smoke might be more susceptible to lung cancer. This explanation for the relationship had plenty of opposition then, and few would support it now. At that time few women got lung cancer because few women had smoked, but when smoking increased among women, so did lung cancer. Furthermore, the incidence of lung cancer was higher for those who smoked more, and quitters had reduced incidence. Eventually, the physiological effects on the body were better understood, and nonobservational animal studies made it clear that smoking does cause lung cancer. 

A **randomized controlled experiment** results when investigators assign subjects to the two treatments in a random fashion. When statistical significance is observed in such an experiment, the investigator and other interested parties will have more confidence in the conclusion that the difference in response has been caused by a difference in treatments. A famous example of this type of experiment and conclusion is the Salk polio vaccine experiment described in Section 10.4. These issues are discussed at greater length in the (nonmathematical) books by Moore and by Freedman et al., listed in the Chapter 1 bibliography.

### \(b\) and the Choice of Sample Size

The probability of a type II error is easily calculated when both population distributions are normal with known values of \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\). Consider the case in which the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>\Delta_{0}\). Let \(\Delta^{\prime}\) denote a value of \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) that exceeds \(\Delta_{0}\) (a value for which \(H_{0}\) is false). The upper-tailed rejection region \(z\geq z_{\text{a}}\) can be re-expressed in the form \(\overline{x}-\overline{y}\geq\Delta_{0}+z_{\text{a}}\sigma_{\overline{x}- \overline{y}}\). Thus the probability of a type II error when \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta^{\prime}\) is

\[\beta(\Delta^{\prime}) =P(\text{not rejecting }H_{0}\text{ when }\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}= \Delta^{\prime})\] \[=P(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}<\Delta_{0}+z_{\text{a}}\sigma_{ \overline{X}-\overline{Y}}\text{ when }\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta^{\prime})\]

When \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta^{\prime},\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) is normally distributed with mean value \(\Delta^{\prime}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}\) (the same standard deviation as when \(H_{0}\) is true); using these values to standardize the inequality in parentheses gives \(\beta\).

\begin{tabular}{l l}
**Alternative Hypothesis** & \(\beta(\Delta^{\prime})=P(\text{type II error when }\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta^{\prime})\) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>\Delta_{0}\) & \(\Phi\bigg{(}z_{\text{a}}-\frac{\Delta^{\prime}-\Delta_{0}}{\sigma}\bigg{)}\) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<\Delta_{0}\) & \(1-\Phi\bigg{(}-z_{\text{a}}-\frac{\Delta^{\prime}-\Delta_{0}}{\sigma}\bigg{)}\) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq\Delta_{0}\) & \(\Phi\bigg{(}z_{\text{a}/2}-\frac{\Delta^{\prime}-\Delta_{0}}{\sigma}\bigg{)}- \Phi\bigg{(}-z_{\text{a}/2}-\frac{\Delta^{\prime}-\Delta_{0}}{\sigma}\bigg{)}\) \\ where \(\sigma=\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}=\sqrt{(\sigma_{1}^{2}/m)+(\sigma_{ 2}^{2}/n)}\) \\ \end{tabular}

If \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) (the true average GPAs for the two levels of effort) differ by as much as.5, what is the probability of detecting such a departure from \(H_{0}\) based on a level.05 test with sample sizes \(m=10\) and \(n=11\)? The value of \(\sigma\) for these sample sizes (the denominator of \(z\)) was previously calculated as.262. The probability of a type II error for the two-tailed level.05 test when

\[\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta^{\prime}=.5\]

is

\[\beta(.5) =\Phi\bigg{(}1.96-\frac{.5-0}{.262}\bigg{)}-\Phi\bigg{(}-1.96- \frac{.5-0}{.262}\bigg{)}\] \[=\Phi(.0516)-\Phi(-3.868)=.521\]

By symmetry we also have \(\beta(-.5)=.521\). Thus the probability of detecting such a departure is \(1-\beta(.5)=.479\). Clearly, we do not have a very good chance of detecting a difference of.5 with these sample sizes. We should not conclude from Example 10.1 that there is no relationship between study time and GPA, because the sample sizes were insufficient.

As in Chapter 9, sample sizes \(m\) and \(n\) can be determined that will satisfy both \(P(\text{type I error})=\text{a}\) specified \(\alpha\) and \(P(\text{type II error}\) when \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta^{\prime})=\text{a}\) specified \(\beta\). For an upper-tailed test, equating the previous expression for \(\beta(\Delta^{\prime})\) to the specified value of \(\beta\) gives

\[\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}=\frac{\left(\Delta^{\prime}- \Delta_{0}\right)^{2}}{\left(z_{\alpha}+z_{\beta}\right)^{2}}\]

When the two sample sizes are equal, this equation yields

\[m=n=\frac{(\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2})(z_{\alpha}+z_{\beta})^{2}}{\left( \Delta^{\prime}-\Delta_{0}\right)^{2}}\]

These expressions are also correct for a lower-tailed test, whereas \(\alpha\) is replaced by \(\alpha\)/2 for a two-tailed test.

## Large-Sample Tests

The assumptions of normal population distributions and known values of \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\) are unnecessary when both sample sizes are large. In this case, the Central Limit Theorem guarantees that \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) has approximately a normal distribution regardless of the underlying population distributions. Furthermore, using \(S_{1}^{2}\) and \(S_{2}^{2}\) in place of \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\) in Expression (10.1) gives a variable whose distribution is approximately standard normal:

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{m }+\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n}}}\]

A large-sample test statistic results from replacing \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) by \(\Delta_{0}\), the expected value of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true. This statistic \(Z\) then has approximately a standard 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:504]

Let \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) denote the true mean scores for the control condition and the experimental condition, respectively. The two hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<0\). \(H_{0}\) will be rejected if \(z\leq-z_{.05}=-1.645\). Then

\[z=\frac{23.87-27.34}{\sqrt{\frac{11.60^{2}}{79}+\frac{8.85^{2}}{85}}}=\frac{-3. 47}{1.620}=-2.14\]

Since \(-2.14\leq-1.645\), \(H_{0}\) is rejected at significance level.05. Alternatively, the \(P\)-value for a lower-tailed \(z\) test is

\[P\text{-value}=\Phi(z)=\Phi(-2.14)=.016\]

which implies rejection at significance level.05. Also, if the test had been two-tailed, then the \(P\)-value would be \(2(.016)=.032\), so the two-tailed test would reject \(H_{0}\) at the.05 level.

We have shown fairly conclusively that the experimental method of instruction is an improvement. Nevertheless, there is more to be said. It is important to view the data graphically to see if there is anything strange. Figure 10.1 shows a plot from Systat combining a boxplot and dotplot.

The plot shows that both groups have outlying observations at the low end; some students showed up for the final but performed very poorly. What happens if we compare the groups while ignoring the low performers whose scores are below 10? The resulting summary information is in Table 10.2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Group** & **Sample Size** & **Sample Mean** & **Sample SD** \\ \hline Control & 79 & 23.87 & 11.60 \\ Experimental & 85 & 27.34 & 8.85 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10.1: Summary results for Example 10.4

Figure 10.1: Boxplot/dotplot for the teaching experiment

Notice that the means and standard deviations for the two groups are now very similar. Indeed, based on Table 10.2 the \(z\)-statistic value is \(-.34\), giving no reason to reject the null hypothesis. For the majority of the students, there appears to be not much effect from the experimental treatment. It is the low performers who make a big difference in the results. There were 18 low performers in the control group but only 9 in the experimental group. The effect of the experimental instruction is to decrease the number of students who perform at the bottom of the scale. This is in accord with the goals of the experimental treatment, which was designed to keep students on track.

### Confidence Intervals for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\)

When both population distributions are normal, standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) gives a random variable \(Z\) with a standard normal distribution. Since the area under the \(z\) curve between \(-z_{\alpha/2}\) and \(z_{\alpha/2}\) is \(1-\alpha\), it follows that

\[P\left(-z_{\alpha/2}<\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{ \frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}}<z_{\alpha/2}\right)=1-\alpha\]

Manipulation of the inequalities inside the parentheses to isolate \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) yields the equivalent probability statement

\[P\left(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+ \frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<\overline{X}-\overline{Y}+z_{\alpha /2}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}\right)=1-\alpha\]

This implies that a \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) CI for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) has lower limit \(\overline{x}-\overline{y}-z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}\) and upper limit \(\overline{x}-\overline{y}+z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}\), where \(\sigma_{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}}\) is the square-root expression. This interval is a special case of the general formula \(\hat{\theta}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\).

If both \(m\) and \(n\) are large, the CLT implies that this interval is valid even without the assumption of normal populations; in this case, the confidence level is _approximately_\(100(1-\alpha)\%\). Furthermore, use of the sample variances \(S_{1}^{2}\) and \(S_{2}^{2}\) in the standardized variable \(Z\) yields a valid interval in which \(s_{1}^{2}\) and \(s_{2}^{2}\) replace \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\).

Provided that \(m\) and \(n\) are both large, a CI for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) with a confidence level of approximately \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) is

\[\overline{x}-\overline{y}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{s_{2} ^{2}}{n}}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Group** & **Sample Size** & **Sample Mean** & **Sample SD** \\ \hline Control & 61 & 29.59 & 5.005 \\ Experimental & 76 & 29.88 & 4.950 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10.2: Summary results without poor performers

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:507]

It is evident that there are more high scorers in the fall and more low scorers in the spring. Table 10.3 summarizes the data.

Let's now calculate a confidence interval for the difference between true average fall ACT score and true average spring ACT score, using a confidence level of 95%:

\[28.25-25.88\pm(1.96)\sqrt{\frac{3.25^{2}}{80}+\frac{4.59^{2}}{74}} =2.37\pm(1.96)(.6456)\] \[=2.37\pm 1.265=(1.10,\ 3.64)\]

That is, with 95% confidence, \(1.10<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<3.64\). We can therefore be highly confident that the true fall average exceeds the true spring average by between 1.10 and 3.64. It makes sense that the fall average should be higher, because students who were less prepared in the fall (as judged by an algebra placement test) were required to take a fall semester college algebra course before taking Calculus I in the spring.

If the variances \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{2}\) are at least approximately known and the investigator uses equal sample sizes, then the sample size \(n\) for each sample that yields a \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) interval of width \(w\) is

\[n=\frac{4z_{\alpha/2}^{2}(\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2})}{w^{2}}\]

which will generally have to be rounded up to an integer.

An article in the November 1983 _Consumer Reports_ compared various types of batteries. The average lifetimes of Duracell Alkaline AA batteries and Eveready Energizer Alkaline AA batteries were given as 4.1 h and 4.5 h, respectively. Suppose these are the population average lifetimes.

**a.**: Let \(\overline{X}\) be the sample average lifetime of 100 Duracell batteries and \(\overline{Y}\) be the sample average lifetime of 100 Eveready batteries. What is the mean value of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) (i.e., where is the distribution of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) centered)? How does your answer depend on the specified sample sizes?
**b.**: Suppose the population standard deviations of lifetime are 1.8 h for Duracell batteries and 2.0 h for Eveready batteries. With the sample sizes given in part (a), what is the variance of the statistic \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\), and what is its standard deviation?
**c.**: For the sample sizes given in part (a), draw a picture of the approximate distribution curve of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) (include a measurement scale on the horizontal axis). Would the shape of the curve necessarily be the same for sample sizes of 10 batteries of each type? Explain.

Test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq 0\) at level.05 using the following data: \(m=45\), \(\overline{x}=42,500\), \(s_{1}=2200\), \(n=45\), \(\overline{y}=40,400\), and \(s_{2}=1900\).
3. Let \(\mu_{1}\) denote true average tread life for a premium brand of P205/65R15 radial tire and let \(\mu_{2}\) denote the true average tread life for an economy brand of the same size. Test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=5000\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>5000\) at level.01 using the following data: \(m=45\), \(\overline{x}=42,500\), \(s_{1}=2200\), \(n=45\), \(\overline{y}=36,800\), and \(s_{2}=1500\).

5. Persons having Raynaud's syndrome are apt to suffer a sudden impairment of blood circulation in fingers and toes. In an experiment to study the extent of this impairment, each subject immersed a forefinger in water and the resulting heat output (cal/cm2/min) was measured. For \(m=10\) subjects with the syndrome, the average heat output was \(\overline{x}=.64\), and for \(n=10\) nonsufferers, the average output was 2.05. Let \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) denote the true average heat outputs for the two types of subjects. Assume that the two distributions of heat output are normal with \(\sigma_{1}=.2\) and \(\sigma_{2}=.4\). **a.**: Consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=-1.0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<-1.0\) at level.01. Describe in words what \(H_{\text{a}}\) says, and then carry out the test. **b.**: Compute the \(P\)-value for the value of \(Z\) obtained in part (a). **c.**: What is the probability of a type II error when the actual difference between \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) is \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=-1.2\)? **d.**: Assuming that \(m=n\), what sample sizes are required to ensure that \(\beta=.1\) when \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=-1.2\)?
6. An experiment to compare the tension bond strength of polymer latex modified mortar (Portland cement mortar to which polymer latex emulsions have been added during mixing) to that of unmodified mortar resulted in \(\overline{x}=18.12\)\(\text{kgf}/\text{cm}^{2}\) for the modified mortar (\(m=40\)) and \(\overline{y}=16.87\)\(\text{kgf}/\text{cm}^{2}\) for the unmodified mortar (\(n=32\)). Let \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) be the true average tension bond strengths for the modified and unmodified mortars, respectively. Assume that the bond strength distributions are both normal. **a.**: Assuming that \(\sigma_{1}=1.6\) and \(\sigma_{2}=1.4\), test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0\) at level.01. **b.**: Compute the probability of a type II error for the test of part (a) when \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=1\). **c.**: Suppose the investigator decided to use a level.05 test and wished \(\beta=.10\) when \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=1\). If \(m=40\), what value of \(n\) is necessary? **d.**: How would the analysis and conclusion of part (a) change if \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\) were unknown but \(s_{1}=1.6\) and \(s_{2}=1.4\)?
7. Are male college students more easily bored than their female counterparts? This question was examined in the article "Boredom in Young Adults--Gender and Cultural Comparisons" (_J. Cross-Cult. Psych._, 1991: 209-223). The authors administered a scale called the Boredom Proneness Scale to 97 male and 148 female U.S. college students. Does the accompanying data support the research hypothesis that the mean Boredom Proneness Rating is higher for men than for women? Test the appropriate hypotheses using a.05 significance level.

* The article "Evaluation of a Ventilation Strategy to Prevent Barotrauma in Patients at High Risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome" (_New Engl. J. Med._, 1998: 355-358) reported on an experiment in which 120 patients with similar clinical features were randomly divided into a control group and a treatment group, each consisting of 60 patients. The sample mean ICU stay (days) and sample standard deviation for the treatment group were 19.9 and 39.1, respectively, whereas these values for the control group were 13.7 and 15.8.

14. The level of monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity in blood platelets (nm/mg protein/h) was determined for each individual in a sample of 43 chronic schizophrenics, resulting in \(\overline{x}=2.69\) and \(s_{1}=2.30\), as well as for 45 normal subjects, resulting in \(\overline{y}=6.35\) and \(s_{2}=4.03\).

18. Credit card spending and resulting debt pose very real threats to consumers in general, and the potential for abuse is especially serious among college students. It has been estimated that about \(\frac{2}{3}\) of all college students possess credit cards, and 80% of these students received cards during their first year of college. The article "College Students' Credit Card Debt and the Role of Parental Involvement: Implications for Public Policy" (_J. Public Policy Mark._, 2001: 105-113) reported that for 209 students whose parents had no involvement whatsoever in credit card acquisition or payments, the sample mean total account balance was $421 with a sample standard deviation of $686, whereas for 75 students whose parents assisted with payments even though they were under no legal obligation to do so, the sample mean and sample standard deviation were $666 and $1048, respectively. All sampled students were at most 21 years of age. **a.** Do you think it is plausible that the distributions of total debt for these two types of students are normal? Why or why not? Is it necessary to assume normality in order to compare the two groups using an inferential procedure described in this chapter? Explain. **b.** Estimate the true average difference between total balance for noninvolvement students and postacquisition-involvement students using a method that incorporates precision into the estimate. Then interpret the estimate. [_Note_: Data was also reported in the article for pre-acquisition involvement only and for both pre- and postacquisition involvement.]
19. Returning to the previous exercise, the mean and standard deviation of the number of credit cards for the no-involvement group were 2.22 and 1.58, respectively, whereas the mean and standard deviation for the payment-help group were 2.09 and 1.65, respectively. Does it appear that the true average number of cards for no-involvement students exceeds the average for payment-help students? Carry out an appropriate test of significance.

10.2 The Two-Sample \(t\) Test

and Confidence Interval

In practice, it is virtually always the case that the values of the population variances are unknown. In the previous section, we illustrated for large sample sizes the use of a test procedure and CI in which the sample variances were used in place of the population variances. In fact, for large samples, the CLT allows us to use these methods even when the two populations of interest are not normal.

In many problems, though, at least one sample size is small and the population variances have unknown values. In the absence of the CLT, we proceed by making specific assumptions about the underlying population distributions. The use of inferential procedures that follow from these assumptions is then restricted to situations in which the assumptions are at least approximately satisfied.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{Both populations are normal, so that \(X_{1},X_{2},\,\ldots,X_{m}\) is a random sample from a normal distribution and so is \(Y_{1}\),..., \(Y_{n}\) (with the \(X\)'s and \(Y\)'s independent of each other). The plausibility of these assumptions can be judged by constructing a normal probability plot of the \(x_{i}\)'s and another of the \(y_{i}\)'s.} \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The test statistic and confidence interval formula are based on the same standardized variable developed in Section 10.1, but the relevant distribution is now \(t\) rather than \(z\).

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{When the population distributions are both normal, the standardized variable} \\ \end{tabular}

\[T=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{m} +\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n}}} \tag{10.2}\]

has approximately a \(t\) distribution with df \(v\) estimated from the data by

\[v=\frac{\left(\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n}\right)^{2}}{\frac{(s_{1} ^{2}/m)^{2}}{m-1}+\frac{(s_{2}^{2}/n)^{2}}{n-1}}=\frac{\left[\left(se_{1} \right)^{2}+\left(se_{2}\right)^{2}\right]^{2}}{\frac{\left(se_{1} \right)^{4}}{m-1}+\frac{\left(se_{2}\right)^{4}}{n-1}}\]

where

\[se_{1}=\frac{s_{1}}{\sqrt{m}}\qquad\quad se_{2}=\frac{s_{2}}{\sqrt{n}}\]

(round \(v\) down to the nearest integer).

We can give some justification for the theorem. Dividing numerator and denominator of (10.2) by the standard deviation of the numerator, we get

\[\frac{\left[\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})\right] \Bigg{/}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}}}{\sqrt{\frac{S_{ 1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n}}/\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2 }^{2}}{n}}}\]

The numerator of this ratio is a standard normal rv because it results from standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\), which is normally distributed because it is the difference of independent normal rv's. The denominator is independent of the numerator because the sample variances are independent of the sample means. However, in order for (10.2) to be a \(t\) random variable, the denominator needs to be the square root of a chi-squared rv over its degrees of freedom, and unfortunately this is not generally true. However, we can try to write the square of the denominator \([S_{1}^{2}/m+S_{2}^{2}/n]/[\sigma_{1}^{2}/m+\sigma_{2}^{2}/n]\) approximately as a chi-squared rv \(W\) with \(v\) degrees of freedom, divided by \(v\), so

\[\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n}=\left(\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{ \sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}\right)\frac{W}{v}\]

To determine \(v\) we equate the means and variances of both sides, with the help of \(E(W)=v\), \(V(W)=2v\), \((m-1)S_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{1}^{2}\sim\chi_{m-1}^{2}\), \((n-1)S_{2}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\sim\chi_{n-1}^{2}\), from Section 6.4. It follows that \(E(S_{1}^{2})=\sigma_{1}^{2}\), \(V(S_{1}^{2})=2\)\(\sigma_{1}^{4}/(m-1)\), and similarly for \(S_{2}^{2}\). The mean of the left-hand side is

\[E\bigg{(}\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n}\bigg{)}=\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}} {m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}\]

which is also the mean of the right-hand side, so the means are equal. The variance of the left-hand side is

\[V\bigg{(}\frac{S_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{S_{2}^{2}}{n}\bigg{)}=\frac{2\sigma_{1}^{4}} {(m-1)m^{2}}+\frac{2\sigma_{2}^{4}}{(n-1)n^{2}}\]

and the variance of the right-hand side is

\[V\bigg{[}\bigg{(}\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}\bigg{)} \frac{W}{v}\bigg{]}=\bigg{(}\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}}{n} \bigg{)}^{2}\cdot\frac{2v}{v^{2}}=\bigg{(}\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{ \sigma_{2}^{2}}{n}\bigg{)}^{2}\cdot\frac{2}{v}\]

We then equate the two, substituting sample variances for the unknown population variances, and solve for \(v\). This gives the \(v\) of the theorem.

Manipulating \(T\) in a probability statement to isolate \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) gives a CI, whereas a test statistic results from replacing \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) by the null value \(\Delta_{0}\).

\begin{tabular}{c c} TWO-SAMPLE & The **two-sample \(t\) confidence interval for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\)** with confidence level \\ \(t\) PROCEDURES & 100(1 \(-\)\(\alpha\))\% is then \\ \end{tabular} A one-sided confidence bound can be calculated as described earlier.

The **two-sample \(t\) test** for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) is as follows:

\[\text{Test statistic value: }t=\frac{\pi-\overline{y}-\Delta_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{m}+\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{n}}}\]

**Alternative Hypothesis** **Rejection Region for Approximate Level \(\alpha\) Test**

\[\begin{array}{ll}H_{\text{a}}\text{: }\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>\Delta_{0}&t\geq t_{x,v}\text{ (upper-tailed test)}\\ H_{\text{a}}\text{: }\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<\Delta_{0}&t\leq-t_{x,v}\text{ (lower-tailed test)}\\ H_{\text{a}}\text{: }\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq\Delta_{0}&\text{either }t\geq t_{x/2,v}\text{ or }t\leq-t_{x/2,v}\text{ (two-tailed test)}\\ \end{array}\]

A _P_-value can be computed as described in Section 9.4 for the one-sample \(t\) test.

Which way of dispensing champagne, the traditional vertical method or a tilted "beer-like" pour, preserves more of the tiny gas bubbles that improve flavor and aroma? The following data was reported in the article "On the Losses of Dissolved CO2 during Champagne Serving" (_J. Agr. Food Chem._, 2010: 8768-6775).

\[\text{M}\text{F}=\frac{\left(\frac{.5^{2}}{4}+\frac{.3^{2}}{4}\right)^{2}}{ \frac{\left(.5^{2}/4\right)^{2}}{3}+\frac{\left(.3^{2}/4\right)^{2}}{3}}=\frac{.007225}{.00147083}=4.91\]

Rounding down, the CI will be based on 4 df. For a confidence level of 99%, we need \(t_{.005,4}=4.604\). The desired interval is

\[4.0-3.7\pm(4.604)\sqrt{\frac{.5^{2}}{4}+\frac{.3^{2}}{4}}=.3\pm(4.604)(.2915)=.3\pm 1.3=(-1.0,1.6)\]

Thus we can be highly confident that \(-1.0<\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<1.6\), where \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) are true average losses for the traditional and slant methods, respectively. Notice that this CI contains 0, so at the 99% confidence level, it is plausible that \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\), that is, that \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\).

The df formula for the \(12^{\circ}\)C comparison yields \(\text{df}=.00105625/.00020208=5.23\), necessitating the use of \(t_{.005,5}=4.032\) for a 99% CI. The resulting interval is (.6, 2.0). Thus 0 is not a plausible value for this difference. It appears from the CI that the true average loss when the slant method is used is smaller than that when the traditional method is used, so that the slant method is better at this temperature. This in fact was the conclusion reported in the popular media.

The deterioration of many municipal pipeline networks across the country is a growing concern. One technology proposed for pipeline rehabilitation uses a flexible liner threaded through existing pipe. The article "Effect of Welding on a High-Density Polyethylene Liner" (_J. Mater_. _Civil Eng._, 1996: 94-100) reported the following data on tensile strength (psi) of liner specimens both when a certain fusion process was used and when this process was not used.

Figure 10.3 shows normal probability plots from MINITAB. The linear pattern in each plot supports the assumption that the tensile strength distributions under the two conditions are both normal.

The authors of the article stated that the fusion process increased the average tensile strength. The message from the comparative boxplot of Figure 10.4 is not all that clear. Let's carry out a test of hypotheses to see whether the data supports this conclusion.

1. Let \(\mu_{1}\) be the true average tensile strength of specimens when the no-fusion treatment is used and \(\mu_{2}\) denote the true average tensile strength when the fusion treatment is used.
2. \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) (no difference in the true average tensile strengths for the two treatments)
3. \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<0\) (true average tensile strength for the no-fusion treatment is less than that for the fusion treatment, so that the investigators' conclusion is correct)

Figure 10.3: Normal probability plots from MINITAB for the tensile strength data

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11776]

If the question posed had been whether fusing increased true average strength by more than 100 psi, then the relevant hypotheses would have been \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=-100\) versus \(H_{\mathbf{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<-100\); that is, the null value would have been \(\Delta_{0}=-100\). \(\blacksquare\)

### Pooled \(t\) Procedures

Alternatives to the two-sample \(t\) procedures just described result from assuming not only that the two population distributions are normal but also that they have equal variances (\(\sigma_{1}^{2}=\sigma_{2}^{2}\)). That is, the two population distribution curves are assumed normal with equal spreads, the only possible difference between them being where they are centered.

Let \(\sigma^{2}\) denote the common population variance. Then standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) gives

\[Z=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{2}}{m }+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}}}=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{ \sqrt{\sigma^{2}\biggl{(}\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\biggr{)}}}\]

which has a standard normal distribution. Before this variable can be used as a basis for making inferences about \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\), the common variance must be estimated from sample data. One estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\) is \(S_{1}^{2}\), the variance of the \(m\) observations in the first sample, and another is \(S_{2}^{2}\), the variance of the second sample. Intuitively, a better estimator than either individual sample variance results from combining the two sample variances. A first thought might be to use \((S_{1}^{2}+S_{2}^{2})/2\), the ordinary average of the two sample variances. However, if \(m>n\), then the first sample contains more information about \(\sigma^{2}\) than does the second sample, and an analogous comment applies if \(m<n\). The following _weighted_ average of the two sample variances, called the **pooled** (i.e., combined) **estimator** of \(\sigma^{2}\), adjusts for any difference between the two sample sizes:

\[S_{p}^{2}=\frac{m-1}{m+n-2}S_{1}^{2}+\frac{n-1}{m+n-2}S_{2}^{2}\]

We can show that \(S_{p}^{2}\) is proportional to a chi-squared rv with \(m+n-2\) df.

Recall that \((m-1)S_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{1}^{2}\sim\chi_{m-1}^{2},\ (n-1)S_{2}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\sim \chi_{n-1}^{2}\). Furthermore, \(S_{1}^{2}\) and \(S_{2}^{2}\) are independent, so with \(\sigma_{1}^{2}=\sigma_{2}^{2}=\sigma^{2}\),

\[\frac{(m+n-2)S_{p}^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{m-1}{\sigma^{2}}S_{1}^{2}+\frac{n-1 }{\sigma^{2}}S_{2}^{2}\]

is the sum of two independent chi-squared rv's with \(m-1\) and \(n-1\) df, respectively, so the sum is a chi-squared rv with \((m-1)+(n-1)=m+n-2\) df. Furthermore, it is also independent of \(\overline{X}\) and \(\overline{Y}\) because the sample means are independent of the sample variances. Now consider the ratio

\[\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{\sigma^{2}(1/m+1/n)} }=\frac{\overline{X}-\overline{Y}-(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2})}{\sqrt{S_{p}^{2}\biggl{(} \frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\biggr{)}}}.\]

On the left is the ratio of a standard normal rv to the square root of an independent chi-squared rv over its degrees of freedom, \(m+n-2\), so the ratio has the \(t\) distribution with \(m\,+\,n\,-\,2\) degrees of freedom. We see therefore that if \(S_{p}^{2}\) replaces \(\sigma^{2}\) in the expression for \(Z\), the resulting standardized variable has a \(t\) distribution. In the same way that earlier standardized variables were used as a basis for deriving confidence intervals and test procedures, this \(t\) variable immediately leads to the pooled \(t\) confidence interval for estimating \(\mu_{1}\,-\,\mu_{2}\) and the pooled \(t\) test for testing hypotheses about a difference between means.

In the past, many statisticians recommended these pooled \(t\) procedures over the two-sample \(t\) procedures. The pooled \(t\) test, for example, can be derived from the likelihood ratio principle, whereas the two-sample \(t\) test is not a likelihood ratio test. Furthermore, the significance level for the pooled \(t\) test is exact, whereas it is only approximate for the two-sample \(t\) test. However, recent research has shown that although the pooled \(t\) test does outperform the two-sample \(t\) test by a bit (smaller \(\beta\)'s for the same \(\alpha\)) when \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\,=\,\sigma_{2}^{2}\), the former test can easily lead to erroneous conclusions if applied when the variances are different. Analogous comments apply to the behavior of the two confidence intervals. That is, the pooled \(t\) procedures are not robust to violations of the equal variance assumption.

It has been suggested that one could carry out a preliminary test of \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma_{1}^{2}\,=\,\sigma_{2}^{2}\) and use a pooled \(t\) procedure if this null hypothesis is not rejected. Unfortunately, the usual "\(F\) test" of equal variances (Section 10.5) is quite sensitive to the assumption of normal population distributions, much more so than \(t\) procedures. We therefore recommend the conservative approach of using two-sample \(t\) procedures unless there is really compelling evidence for doing otherwise, particularly when the two sample sizes are different.

### Type Il Error Probabilities

Determining type II error probabilities (or equivalently, power \(=1\,-\,\beta\)) for the two-sample \(t\) test is complicated. There does not appear to be any simple way to use the \(\beta\) curves of Appendix Table A.16. The most recent version of MINITAB (Version 16) will calculate power for the pooled \(t\) test but not for the two-sample \(t\) test. However, the UCLA Statistics Department homepage ([http://www.stat.ucla.edu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu)) permits access to a power calculator that will do this. For example, we specified \(m\,=10\), \(n\,=\,8\), \(\sigma_{1}\,=\,300\), \(\sigma_{2}\,=\,225\) (these are the sample sizes for Example 10.7, whose sample standard deviations are somewhat smaller than these values of \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\)) and asked for the power of a two-tailed level.05 test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}\,-\,\mu_{2}\,=\,0\) when \(\mu_{1}\,-\,\mu_{2}\,=\,100\), 250, and 500. The resulting values of the power were.1089,.4609, and.9635 (corresponding to \(\beta\,=\,.89\),.54, and.04), respectively. In general, \(\beta\) will decrease as the sample sizes increase, as \(\alpha\) increases, and as \(\mu_{1}\,-\,\mu_{2}\) moves farther from 0. The software will also calculate sample sizes necessary to obtain a specified value of power for a particular value of \(\mu_{1}\,-\,\mu_{2}\).

## 10 Analysis of Paired Data

In Sections 10.1 and 10.2, we considered estimating or testing for a difference between two means \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\). This was done by utilizing the results of a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{m}\) from the distribution with mean \(\mu_{1}\) and a completely independent (of the \(X\)'s) sample \(Y_{1}\),..., \(Y_{n}\) from the distribution with mean \(\mu_{2}\). That is, either \(m\) individuals were selected from population 1 and \(n\) different individuals from population 2, or \(m\) individuals (or experimental objects) were given one treatment and another \(n\) individuals were given the other treatment. In contrast, there are a number of experimental situations in which there is only one set of \(n\) individuals or experimental objects, and two observations are made on each individual or object, resulting in a natural pairing of values.

Figure 10.6 shows a normal probability plot of the 16 differences; the pattern in the plot is quite straight, supporting the normality assumption. A boxplot of these differences appears in Figure 10.7; the box is located considerably to the right of zero, suggesting that perhaps \(\mu_{D}>0\) (note also that 13 of the 16 differences are positive and only two are negative).

Let's now use the recommended sequence of steps to test the appropriate hypotheses.

1. Let \(\mu_{D}\) denote the true average difference between elevation time before the change in work conditions and time after the change.
2. \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{D}=0\) (there is no difference between true average time before the change and true average time after the change)
3. \(H_{a}\): \(\mu_{D}\neq 0\)

Figure 10.7: A boxplot of the differences in Example 10.9

Figure 10.6: A normal probability plot from MINITAB of the differences in Example 10.9

4. \(t=\frac{\overline{d}-0}{s_{D}/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{\overline{d}}{s_{D}/\sqrt{n}}\)
5. \(n=16\), \(\Sigma d_{i}=108\), \(\sum d_{i}^{2}=1746\), from which \(\overline{d}=6.75\), \(s_{D}=8.234\), and \[t=\frac{6.75}{8.234/\sqrt{16}}=3.28\approx 3.3\]
6. Appendix Table A.7 shows that the area to the right of 3.3 under the \(t\) curve with 15 df is.002. The inequality in \(H_{\text{a}}\) implies that a two-tailed test is appropriate, so the \(P\)-value is approximately 2(.002) \(=.004\) (MINITAB gives.0051).
7. Since.004 \(\leq.01\), the null hypothesis can be rejected at either significance level.05 or.01. It does appear that the true average difference between times is something other than zero; that is, true average time after the change is different from that before the change. Recalling that arm elevation should be kept under 30\({}^{\circ}\), we can conclude that the situation became worse because the amount of time below 30\({}^{\circ}\) decreased.

When the number of pairs is large, the assumption of a normal difference distribution is not necessary. The CLT validates the resulting \(z\) test.

### A Confidence Interval for \(\mu_{D}\)

In the same way that the \(t\) CI for a single population mean \(\mu\) is based on the \(t\) variable \(T=(\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\), a \(t\) confidence interval for \(\mu_{D}\) (\(=\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\)) is based on the fact that

\[T=\frac{\overline{D}-\mu_{D}}{S_{D}/\sqrt{n}}\]

has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-1\) df. Manipulation of this \(t\) variable, as in previous derivations of CIs, yields the following 100(1 \(-\)\(\alpha\))% CI:

The **paired \(t\) CI for \(\mu_{D}\)** is

\[\overline{d}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\cdot s_{D}/\sqrt{n}\]

A one-sided confidence bound results from retaining the relevant sign and replacing \(t_{\alpha/2}\) by \(t_{\alpha}\).

When \(n\) is small, the validity of this interval requires that the distribution of differences be at least approximately normal. For large \(n\), the CLT ensures that the resulting \(z\) interval is valid without any restrictions on the distribution of differences.

Adding computerized medical images to a database promises to provide great resources for physicians. However, there are other methods of obtaining such information, so the issue of efficiency of access needs to be investigated. The article "The Comparative Effectiveness of Conventional and Digital Image Libraries" (_J. Audiov. Media Med._, 2001: 8-15) reported on an experiment in which 13 computer-proficient medical professionals were timed both while retrieving an image from a library of slides and while retrieving the same image from a computer database with a web front end.

Let \(\mu_{D}\) denote the true mean difference between slide retrieval time (sec) and digital retrieval time. Using the paired \(t\) confidence interval to estimate \(\mu_{D}\) requires that the difference distribution be at least approximately normal. The linear pattern of points in the normal probability plot from MINITAB (Figure 10.8) validates the normality assumption. (Only 9 points appear because of ties in the differences.)

Relevant summary quantities are \(\Sigma d_{i}=267\), \(\sum d_{i}^{2}=7201\), from which \(\overline{d}=20.5\), \(s_{D}=11.96\). The \(t\) critical value required for a 95% confidence level is \(t_{025,12}=2.179\), and the 95% CI is

\[\overline{d}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-1}\cdot\frac{s_{D}}{\sqrt{n}}=20.5\pm 2.179\cdot \frac{11.96}{\sqrt{13}}=20.5\pm 7.2=(13.3,27.7)\]

Thus we can be highly confident (at the 95% confidence level) that \(13.3<\mu_{D}\)\(<27.7\). This interval of plausible values is rather wide, a consequence of the sample standard deviation being large relative to the sample mean. A sample size much larger than 13 would be required to estimate with substantially more precision. Notice, however, that 0 lies well outside the interval, suggesting that \(\mu_{D}>0\); this is confirmed

Figure 10.8: Normal probability plot of the differences in Example 10.10

by a formal hypothesis test. It is not hard to show that 0 is outside the 95% CI if and only if the two-tailed test rejects \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{D}=0\) at the.05 level. We can conclude from the experiment that computer retrieval appears to be faster on average. 

### Paired Data and Two-Sample \(t\) Procedures

Consider using the two-sample \(t\) test on paired data. The numerators of the paired \(t\) and two-sample \(t\) test statistics are identical, since \(\overline{d}=\sum d_{i}/n=[\sum{(x_{i}-y_{i})}]/n=(\sum{x_{i}})/n-(\sum{y_{i}}) /n=\overline{x}-\overline{y}\). The difference between the two statistics is due entirely to the denominators. Each test statistic is obtained by standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\)\((=\overline{D})\), but in the presence of dependence the two-sample \(t\) standardization is incorrect. To see this, recall from Section 6.3 that

\[V(X\pm Y)=V(X)+V(Y)\pm 2\text{ Cov}(X,Y)\]

Since the correlation between \(X\) and \(Y\) is

\[\rho=\text{Corr}(X,Y)=\text{Cov}(X,Y)/[\sqrt{V(X)}\cdot\sqrt{V(Y)}]\]

It follows that

\[V(X-Y)=\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}-2\rho\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\]

Applying this to \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) yields

\[V(\overline{X}-\overline{Y})=V\bigg{(}\frac{1}{n}\sum{D_{i}}\bigg{)}=\frac{V(D _{i})}{n}=\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}-2\rho\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}}{n}\]

The two-sample \(t\) test is based on the assumption of independence, in which case \(\rho=0\). But in many paired experiments, there will be a strong _positive_ dependence between \(X\) and \(Y\) (large \(X\) associated with large \(Y\)), so that \(\rho\) will be positive and the variance of \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) will be smaller than \(\sigma_{1}^{2}/n+\sigma_{2}^{2}/n\). Thus _whenever there is positive dependence within pairs_, _the denominator for the paired \(t\) statistic should be smaller than for \(t\) of the independent-samples test_. Often two-sample \(t\) will be much closer to zero than paired \(t\), considerably understating the significance of the data.

Similarly, when data is paired, the paired \(t\) CI will usually be narrower than the (incorrect) two-sample \(t\) CI. This is because there is typically much less variability in the differences than in the \(x\) and \(y\) values.

### Paired Versus Unpaired Experiments

In our examples, paired data resulted from two observations on the same subject (Example 10.9) or experimental object (location in Example 10.8). Even when this cannot be done, paired data with dependence within pairs can be obtained by matching individuals or objects on one or more characteristics thought to influence responses. For example, in a medical experiment to compare the efficacy of two drugs for lowering blood pressure, the experimenter's budget might allow for the treatment of 20 patients. If 10 patients are randomly selected for treatment with the first drug and another 10 independently selected for treatment with the second drug, an independent-samples experiment results.

However, the experimenter, knowing that blood pressure is influenced by age and weight, might decide to pair off patients so that within each of the resulting 10 pairs, age and weight were approximately equal (although there might be sizable differences between pairs). Then each drug would be given to a different patient within each pair for a total of 10 observations on each drug.

Without this matching (or "blocking"), one drug might appear to outperform the other just because patients in one sample were lighter and younger and thus more susceptible to a decrease in blood pressure than the heavier and older patients in the second sample. However, there is a price to be paid for pairing--a smaller number of degrees of freedom for the paired analysis--so we must ask when one type of experiment should be preferred to the other.

There is no straightforward and precise answer to this question, but there are some useful guidelines. If we have a choice between two \(t\) tests that are both valid (and carried out at the same level of significance \(\alpha\)), we should prefer the test that has the larger number of degrees of freedom. The reason for this is that a larger number of degrees of freedom means a smaller \(\beta\) for any fixed alternative value of the parameter or parameters. That is, for a fixed type I error probability, the probability of a type II error is decreased by increasing degrees of freedom.

However, if the experimental units are quite heterogeneous in their responses, it will be difficult to detect small but significant differences between two treatments. This is essentially what happened in the data set in Example 10.8; for both "treatments" (bottom water and surface water), there is great between-location variability, which tends to mask differences in treatments within locations. If there is a high positive correlation within experimental units or subjects, the variance of \(\overline{D}=\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\) will be much smaller than the unpaired variance. Because of this reduced variance, it will be easier to detect a difference with paired samples than with independent samples. The pros and cons of pairing can now be summarized as follows.

1. If there is great heterogeneity between experimental units and a large correlation within experimental units (large positive \(\rho\)), then the loss in degrees of freedom will be compensated for by the increased precision associated with pairing, so a paired experiment is preferable to an independent-samples experiment.
2. If the experimental units are relatively homogeneous and the correlation within pairs is not large, the gain in precision due to pairing will be outweighed by the decrease in degrees of freedom, so an independent-samples experiment should be used.

Of course, values of \(\sigma_{1}^{2},\sigma_{2}^{2}\), and \(\rho\) will not usually be known very precisely, so an investigator will be required to make a seat-of-the-pants judgment as to whether Situation 1 or 2 obtains. In general, if the number of observations that can be obtained is large, then a loss in degrees of freedom (e.g., from 40 to 20) will not be serious; but if the number is small, then the loss (say, from 16 to 8) because of pairing may be serious if not compensated for by increased precision. Similar considerations apply when choosing between the two types of experiments to estimate \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) with a confidence interval.

43. In an experiment designed to study the effects of illumination level on task performance ("Performance of Complex Tasks Under Different Levels of Illumination," \(J\). _Illumin. Engrg._, 1976: 235-242), subjects were required to insert a fine-tipped probe into the eyeholes of 10 needles in rapid succession both for a low light level with a black background and a higher level with a white background. Each data value is the time (sec) required to complete the task. 

Does the data indicate that the higher level of illumination yields a decrease of more than 5 s in true average task completion time? Test the appropriate hypotheses using the _P_-value approach.
44. It has been estimated that between 1945 and 1971, as many as 2 million children were born to mothers treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES), a nonsteroidal estrogen recommended for pregnancy maintenance. The FDA banned this drug in 1971 because research indicated a link with the incidence of cervical cancer. The article "Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Diethylstilbestrol (DES) on Hemispheric Laterality and Spatial Ability in Human Males" (_Hormones Behav._, 1992: 62-75) discussed a study in which 10 males exposed to DES and their unexposed brothers underwent various tests. This is the summary data on the results of a spatial ability test: \(\overline{x}=12.6\) (exposed), \(\overline{y}=13.7\), and standard error of mean difference \(=.5\). Test at level.05 to see whether exposure is associated with reduced spatial ability by obtaining the _P_-value.

J. Med._, 1984: 889). Here are the values of the differences between age at onset of symptoms and age at diagnosis: 

* Does the accompanying normal probability plot cast strong doubt on the approximate normality of the population distribution of differences?
* Calculate a lower 95% confidence bound for the population mean difference, and interpret the resulting bound.
* Suppose the (age at diagnosis) \(-\) (age at onset) differences had been calculated. What would be a 95% upper confidence bound for the corresponding population mean difference?
46. Example 1.2 describes a study of children's private speech (talking to themselves). The 33 children were each observed in about 100 ten-second intervals in the first grade, and again in the second and third grades. Because private speech occurs more in challenging circumstances, the children were observed while doing their mathematics.

The speech was classified as on task (about the math lesson), off task, or mumbling (the observer could not tell what was said). Here are the 33 first-grade mumble scores:

\[20.8\ \ 24.4\ \ 19.4\ \ 33.3\ \ 26.0\ \ 56.6\ \ 39.5\ \ 24.7\]

\[21.6\ \ 32.1\ \ 48.1\ \ 19.5\ \ 19.2\ \ 43.0\ \ 26.3\ \ 22.7\]

\[49.4\ \ 35.4\ \ 56.8\ \ 45.4\ \ 28.7\ \ 42.2\ \ 20.3\ \ 20.0\]

\[34.0\ \ 26.9\ \ 48.4\ \ 27.6\ \ 52.6\ \ 5.9\ \ 38.5\ \ 22.1\]

\[22.2\]

and here are the third-grade mumble scores:

\[28.8\ \ 57.0\ \ 23.9\ \ 46.9\ \ 50.0\ \ 64.6\ \ 54.2\ \ 55.3\]

\[21.4\ \ 38.3\ \ 78.5\ \ 38.1\ \ 44.3\ \ 11.7\ \ 58.6\ \ 76.1\]

\[76.4\ \ 48.6\ \ 37.2\ \ 69.8\ \ 29.1\ \ 60.4\ \ 57.8\ \ 38.7\]

## 10.4 Inferences About Two Population Proportions

Having presented methods for comparing the means of two different populations, we now turn to the comparison of two population proportions. The notation for this problem is an extension of the notation used in the corresponding one-population problem. We let \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) denote the proportions of individuals in populations 1 and 2, respectively, who possess a particular characteristic. Alternatively, if we use the label \(S\) for an individual who possesses the characteristic of interest (does favor a particular proposition, has read at least one book within the last month, etc.), then \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) represent the probabilities of seeing the label \(S\) on a randomly chosen individual from populations 1 and 2, respectively.

We will assume the availability of a sample of \(m\) individuals from the first population and \(n\) from the second. The variables \(X\) and \(Y\) will represent the number of individuals in each sample possessing the characteristic that defines \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\). Provided the population sizes are much larger than the sample sizes, the distribution of \(X\) can be taken to be binomial with parameters \(m\) and \(p_{1}\), and similarly, \(Y\) is taken to be a binomial variable with parameters \(n\) and \(p_{2}\). Furthermore, the samples are assumed to be independent of each other, so that \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent rv's.

The obvious estimator for \(p_{1}-p_{2}\), the difference in population proportions, is the corresponding difference in sample proportions \(X/m-Y/n\). With \(\hat{p}_{1}=X/m\) and \(\hat{p}_{2}=Y/n\), the estimator of \(p_{1}-p_{2}\) can be expressed as \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\).

\[\text{Let}\ X\sim\text{Bin}(m,p_{1})\text{ and}\ Y\sim\text{Bin}(n,p_{2})\text{ with}\ X\text{ and}\ Y\text{ independent variables. Then}\]

\[E(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})=p_{1}-p_{2}\]

so \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(p_{1}-p_{2}\), and

\[V(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2})=\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{m}+\frac{p_{2}q_{2}}{n}\qquad( \text{where}\ q_{i}=1-p_{i}) \tag{10.3}\]

**Proof** Since \(E(X)=mp_{1}\) and \(E(Y)=np_{2}\),

\[E\left(\frac{X}{m}-\frac{Y}{n}\right)=\frac{1}{m}E(X)-\frac{1}{n}E(Y)=\frac{1}{m }mp_{1}-\frac{1}{n}np_{2}=p_{1}-p_{2}\]

Since \(V(X)=mp_{1}q_{1}\), \(V(Y)=np_{2}q_{2}\), and \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent,

\[V\left(\frac{X}{m}-\frac{Y}{n}\right)=V\left(\frac{X}{m}\right)+V\left(\frac{Y }{n}\right)=\frac{1}{m^{2}}V(X)+\frac{1}{n^{2}}V(Y)=\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{m}+\frac {p_{2}q_{2}}{n}\]

We will focus first on situations in which both \(m\) and \(n\) are large. Then because \(\hat{p}_{1}\) and \(\hat{p}_{2}\) individually have approximately normal distributions, the estimator \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\) also has approximately a normal distribution. Standardizing \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\) yields a variable \(Z\) whose distribution is approximately standard normal:

\[Z=\frac{\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}-(p_{1}-p_{2})}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{m}}+ \frac{p_{2}q_{2}}{n}}\]

## A Large-Sample Test Procedure

Analogously to the hypotheses for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\), the most general null hypothesis an investigator might consider would be of the form \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}=\Delta_{0}\), where \(\Delta_{0}\) is again a specified number. Although for population means the case \(\Delta_{0}\neq 0\) presented no difficulties, for population proportions the cases \(\Delta_{0}=0\) and \(\Delta_{0}\neq 0\) must be considered separately. Since the vast majority of actual problems of this sort involve \(\Delta_{0}=0\) (i.e., the null hypothesis \(p_{1}=p_{2}\)), we will concentrate on this case. When \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}=0\) is true, let \(p\) denote the common value of \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) (and similarly for \(q\)). Then the standardized variable

\[Z=\frac{\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}-0}{\sqrt{pq\left(\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n} \right)}} \tag{10.4}\]

has approximately a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true. However, this \(Z\) cannot serve as a test statistic because the value of \(p\) is unknown--\(H_{0}\) asserts only that there is a common value of \(p\), but does not say what that value is. To obtain a test statistic having approximately a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true (so that use of an appropriate \(z\) critical value specifies a level \(\alpha\) test), \(p\) must be estimated from the sample data.

Assuming then that \(p_{1}=p_{2}=p\), instead of separate samples of size \(m\) and \(n\) from two different populations (two different binomial distributions), we really have a single sample of size \(m+n\) from one population with proportion \(p\). Since the total number of individuals in this combined sample having the characteristic of interest is \(X+Y\), the estimator of \(p\) is

\[\hat{p}=\frac{X+Y}{m+n}=\frac{m}{m+n}\hat{p}_{1}+\frac{n}{m+n}\hat{p}_{2} \tag{10.5}\]The second expression for \(\hat{p}\) shows that it is actually a weighted average of estimators \(\hat{p}_{1}\) and \(\hat{p}_{2}\) obtained from the two samples. If we take (10.5) (with \(\hat{q}=1-\hat{p}\)) and substitute back into (10.4), the resulting statistic has approximately a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}=0\) \\ Test statistic value (large samples): \(z=\dfrac{\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}}{\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}\bigg{(}\dfrac{1}{m}+ \dfrac{1}{n}\bigg{)}}}\) \\ Alternative Hypothesis & **Rejection Region for Approximate** \\  & **Level \(\alpha\) Test** \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}>0\) & \(z\geq z_{\alpha}\) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}<0\) & \(z\leq-z_{\alpha}\) \\ \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}\neq 0\) & either \(z\geq z_{\alpha/2}\) or \(z\leq-z_{\alpha/2}\) \\ A \(P\)-value is calculated in the same way as for previous \(z\) tests. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Some defendants in criminal proceedings plead guilty and are sentenced without a trial, whereas others who plead innocent are subsequently found guilty and then are sentenced. In recent years, legal scholars have speculated as to whether sentences of those who plead guilty differ in severity from sentences for those who plead innocent and are subsequently judged guilty. Consider the accompanying data on defendants from San Francisco County accused of robbery, all of whom had previous prison records ("Does It Pay to Plead Guilty? Differential Sentencing and the Functioning of Criminal Courts," _Law Soc. Rev._, 1981-1982: 45-69). Does this data suggest that the proportion of all defendants in these circumstances who plead guilty and are sent to prison differs from the proportion who are sent to prison after pleading innocent and being found guilty?

\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline  & & **Plea** \\ \cline{2-3}  & **Gulity** & **Not guilty** \\ \hline Number judged guilty & \(m=191\) & \(n=64\) \\ Number sentenced to prison & \(x=101\) & \(y=56\) \\ Sample proportion & \(\hat{p}_{1}=.529\) & \(\hat{p}_{2}=.875\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Let \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) denote the two population proportions. The hypotheses of interest are \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}\neq 0\). At level.01, \(H_{0}\) should be rejected if either \(z\geq z_{.005}=2.58\) or if \(z\leq-2.58\). The combined estimate of the common success proportion is \(\hat{p}=(101+56)/(191+64)=.616\). The value of the test statistic is then

\[z=\dfrac{.529-.875}{\sqrt{(.616)(.384)\bigg{(}\dfrac{1}{191}+\dfrac{1}{64} \bigg{)}}}=\dfrac{-.346}{.070}=-4.94\]Since \(-4.94\leq-2.58\), \(H_{0}\) must be rejected.

The \(P\)-value for a two-tailed \(z\) test is

\[P\text{-value}\,=\,2[1\,-\Phi([z])]=2[1\,-\,\Phi(4.94)]<2[1\,-\,\Phi(3.49)]=.0004\]

A more extensive standard normal table yields \(P\text{-value}\,=.0000006\). This \(P\)-value is so minuscule that at any reasonable level \(\alpha\), \(H_{0}\) should be rejected. The data very strongly suggests that \(p_{1}\neq p_{2}\) and, in particular, that initially pleading guilty may be a good strategy as far as avoiding prison is concerned.

The cited article also reported data on defendants in several other counties. The authors broke down the data by type of crime (burglary or robbery) and by nature of prior record (none, some but no prison, and prison). In every case, the conclusion was the same: Among defendants judged guilty, those who pleaded that way were less likely to receive prison sentences. 

### Type II Error Probabilities and Sample Sizes

Here the determination of \(\beta\) is a bit more cumbersome than it was for other large-sample tests. The reason is that the denominator of \(Z\) is an estimate of the standard deviation of \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\), assuming that \(p_{1}=p_{2}=p\). When \(H_{0}\) is false, \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\) must be restandardized using

\[\sigma_{\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{p_{1}q_{1}}{m}+\frac{p_{2}q_{2}} {n}} \tag{10.6}\]

The form of \(\sigma\) implies that \(\beta\) is not a function of just \(p_{1}-p_{2}\), so we denote it by \(\beta(p_{1},\,p_{2})\)ProofFor the upper-tailed test (\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}>0\)),

\[\beta(p_{1},p_{2}) =P\left[\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}<z_{\alpha}\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}\left( \frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\right)}\right]\] \[=P\left[\frac{\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}-(p_{1}-p_{2})}{\sigma}<\frac {z_{\alpha}\sqrt{\hat{p}\hat{q}\left(\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}\right)}-(p_{1}-p _{2})}{\sigma}\right]\]

When \(m\) and \(n\) are both large,

\[\hat{p}=\frac{m\hat{p}_{1}+n\hat{p}_{2}}{m+n}\approx\frac{mp_{1}+np_{2}}{m+n}= \overline{p}\]

and \(\hat{q}\approx\overline{q}\), which yields the previous (approximate) expression for \(\beta(p_{1},\,p_{2})\). 

Alternatively, for specified \(p_{1},\,p_{2}\) with \(p_{1}-p_{2}=d\), the sample sizes necessary to achieve \(\beta(p_{1},\,p_{2})=\beta\) can be determined. For example, for the upper-tailed test, we equate \(-z_{\beta}\) to the argument of \(\Phi(\cdot)\) (i.e., what's inside the parentheses) in the foregoing box. If \(m=n\), there is a simple expression for the common value.

For the case \(m=n\), the level \(\alpha\) test has type II error probability \(\beta\) at the alternative values \(p_{1},\,p_{2}\) with \(p_{1}-p_{2}=d\) when

\[n=\frac{\left[z_{\alpha}\sqrt{(p_{1}+p_{2})(q_{1}+q_{2})/2}+z_{\beta}\sqrt{p_{1 }q_{1}+p_{2}q_{2}}\right]^{2}}{d^{2}} \tag{10.7}\]

for an upper- or lower-tailed test, with \(\alpha\)/2 replacing \(\alpha\) for a two-tailed test.

One of the truly impressive applications of statistics occurred in connection with the design of the 1954 Salk polio vaccine experiment and analysis of the resulting data. Part of the experiment focused on the efficacy of the vaccine in combating paralytic polio. Because it was thought that without a control group of children, there would be no sound basis for assessment of the vaccine, it was decided to administer the vaccine to one group and a placebo injection (visually indistinguishable from the vaccine but known to have no effect) to a control group. For ethical reasons and also because it was thought that the knowledge of vaccine administration might have an effect on treatment and diagnosis, the experiment was conducted in a **double-blind** manner. That is, neither the individuals receiving injections nor those administering them actually knew who was receiving vaccine and who was receiving the placebo (samples were numerically coded)--remember, at that point it was not at all clear whether the vaccine was beneficial.

Let \(p_{1}\) and \(p_{2}\) be the probabilities of a child getting paralytic polio for the control and treatment conditions, respectively. The objective was to test the hypotheses \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}-p_{2}>0\) (the alternative hypothesis states that a vaccinated child is less likely to contract polio than an unvaccinated child). Supposing the true value of \(p_{1}\) is.0003 (an incidence rate of 30 per 100,000), the vaccine would be a significant improvement if the incidence rate was halved--that is, \(p_{2}=.00015\). Using a level \(\alpha=.05\) test, it would then be reasonable to ask for sample sizes for which \(\beta=.1\) when \(p_{1}=.0003\) and \(p_{2}=.00015\). Assuming equal sample sizes, the required \(n\) is obtained from (10.7) as

\[n = \frac{\left[1.645\sqrt{(.5)(.00045)(.199955)}+1.28\sqrt{(.00015)(.99985)+(.0 003)(.9997)}\right]^{2}}{(.0003-.00015)^{2}}\] \[= \left[(.0349+.0271)/.00015\right]^{2}\approx 171,000\]

The actual data for this experiment follows. Sample sizes of approximately 200,000 were used. The reader can easily verify that \(z=6.43\), a highly significant value. The vaccine was judged a resounding success!

\[\begin{array}{llll}\text{Placebo:}&m=201,&229&x=\text{number of cases of analytic polio}=110\\ \text{Vaccine:}&n=200,&745&y=33\end{array}\]

## A Large-Sample Confidence Interval for \(p_{1}-p_{2}\)

As with means, many two-sample problems involve the objective of comparison through hypothesis testing, but sometimes an interval estimate for \(p_{1}-p_{2}\) is appropriate. Both \(\hat{p}_{1}=X/m\) and \(\hat{p}_{2}=Y/n\) have approximate normal distributions when \(m\) and \(n\) are both large. If we identify \(\theta\) with \(p_{1}-p_{2}\), then \(\hat{\theta}=\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\) satisfies the conditions necessary for obtaining a large-sample CI. In particular, the estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{\theta}\) is \(\sqrt{(\hat{p}_{1}\hat{q}_{1}/m)+(\hat{p}_{2}\hat{q}_{2}/n)}\). The 100(1 - \(\alpha\))% interval \(\hat{\theta}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\cdot\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}\) then becomes

\[\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_{1}\hat{q}_{1}}{m} +\frac{\hat{p}_{2}\hat{q}_{2}}{n}}\]

Notice that the estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{p}_{1}-\hat{p}_{2}\) (the square-root expression) is different here from what it was for hypothesis testing when \(\Delta_{0}=0\).

Recent research has shown that the actual confidence level for the traditional CI just given can sometimes deviate substantially from the nominal level (the level you think you are getting when you use a particular \(z\) critical value--e.g., 95% when \(z_{\alpha/2}=1.96\)). The suggested improvement is to add one success and one failure to each of the two samples and then replace the \(\hat{p}\)'s and \(\hat{q}\)'s in the foregoing formula by \(\hat{p}\)'s and \(\hat{q}\)'s where \(\hat{p}_{1}=(x+1)/(m+2)\), etc. This interval can also be used when sample sizes are quite small.

The authors of the article "Adjuvant Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy in Node-Positive Premenopausal Women with Breast Cancer" (_New Engl. J. Med._, 1997: 956-962) reported on the results of an experiment designed to compare treating cancer patients with only chemotherapy to treatment with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Of the 154 individuals who received the chemotherapy-only treatment, 76 survived at least 15 years, whereas 98 of the 164 patients who received the hybrid treatment survived at least that long. With \(p_{1}\) denoting the proportion of all such women who, when treated with just chemotherapy, survive at least 15 years and \(p_{2}\) denoting the analogous proportion for the hybrid treatment, \(\hat{p}_{1}=76/154=.494\) and \(\hat{p}_{2}=98/164=.598\). A confidence interval for the difference between proportions based on the traditional formula with a confidence level of approximately 99% is

\[.494-.598\pm 2.58\sqrt{\frac{(.494)(.506)}{154}+\frac{(.598)(.402)}{164}}=-.104\pm.1 43=(-.247,.039)\]

At the 99% confidence level, it is plausible that \(-.247<p_{1}-p_{2}<.039\). This interval is reasonably wide, a reflection of the fact that the sample sizes are not terribly large for this type of interval. Notice that 0 is one of the plausible values of \(p_{1}-p_{2}\) suggesting that neither treatment can be judged superior to the other. Using \(\tilde{p}_{1}=77/156=.494\), \(\tilde{q}_{1}=79/156=.506\), \(\tilde{p}_{2}=.596\), \(\tilde{q}_{2}=.404\) based on sample sizes of 156 and 166, respectively, the "improved" interval here is essentially identical to the earlier interval. 

### Small-Sample Inferences

On occasion an inference concerning \(p_{1}-p_{2}\) may have to be based on samples for which at least one sample size is small. Appropriate methods for such situations are not as straightforward as those for large samples, and there is more controversy among statisticians as to recommended procedures. One frequently used test, called the Fisher-Irwin test, is based on the hypergeometric distribution.

## Testing Hypotheses

A test procedure for hypotheses concerning the ratio \(\sigma_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\), as well as a CI for this ratio are based on the following result from Section 6.4.

\[\begin{array}{l} {\text{THEOREM}} & {\text{Let }X_{1},\,\ldots,\,X_{m}\text{ be a random sample from a normal distribution with variance }\sigma_{1}^{2}\text{, let }Y_{1},\,\ldots,\,Y_{n}\text{ be another random sample (independent of the }X_{i}\text{'s) from a normal distribution with variance }\sigma_{2}^{2}\text{, and let }S_{1}^{2}\text{ and }S_{2}^{2}\text{ denote the two sample variances. Then the rv } \\ & F = \frac{S_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{1}^{2}}{S_{2}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}}\]

has an \(F\) distribution with \(v_{1}=m-1\) and \(v_{2}=n-1\).

Under the null hypothesis of equal population variances, (10.8) reduces to the ratio of sample variances. For a test statistic we use this ratio of sample variances; and the claim that \(\sigma_{1}^{2}=\sigma_{2}^{2}\) is rejected if the ratio differs by too much from 1.

The normality assumption is very important for the use of Expression (10.8) so we check the normal plot from MINITAB, shown in Figure 10.9. There is no apparent reason to doubt normality here.

Notice the difference in slopes for the two sources. This suggests different variabilities because the vertical axis is the \(z\)-score and is related to the horizontal axis (grams) by \(z=(\text{grams}-\text{mean})/(\text{std dev})\). Thus, when score is plotted against grams the slope is the reciprocal of the standard deviation. Now let's test \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma_{1}^{2}=\sigma_{2}^{2}\) against a two-tailed alternative with \(\alpha=.02\). We need the critical values \(F_{.01,5,7}=7.46\) and \(F_{.99,5,7}=1/F_{.01,7.5}=1/10.46=.0956\). We have

Figure 10.9: Normal plot for baked goodswhich exceeds 7.46, so the hypothesis of equal variances is rejected. We conclude that there is a difference in weight variation, and the English muffins are less variable.

Notice that it is not really necessary to use the lower-tailed critical value here if the groups are chosen so the first group has the larger variance, and therefore the value of \(f=s_{1}^{2}/s_{2}^{2}\) exceeds 1. Because \(f>1\), the only comparison is between the computed \(f\) and the upper critical value 7.46. It does not change the result of the test to fix things so \(f>1\), so it is not cheating to simplify the test in this way.

### \(P\)-Values for \(F\) Tests

Recall that the \(P\)-value for an upper-tailed \(t\) test is the area under the relevant \(t\) curve (the one with appropriate df) to the right of the calculated \(t\). In the same way, the \(P\)-value for an upper-tailed \(F\) test is the area under the \(F\) curve with appropriate numerator and denominator df to the right of the calculated \(f\). Figure 10.10 illustrates this for a test based on \(v_{1}=4\) and \(v_{2}=6\).

Unfortunately, tabulation of \(F\) curve upper-tail areas is much more cumbersome than for \(t\) curves because two df's are involved. For each combination of \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\), our \(F\) table gives only the four critical values that capture areas.10,.05,.01, and.001. Figure 10.11 (next page) shows what can be said about the \(P\)-value depending on where \(f\) falls relative to the four critical values.

For example, for a test with \(v_{1}=4\) and \(v_{2}=6\),

\[\begin{array}{ll}f=5.70&\Rightarrow.01<P\mbox{-value}<.05\\ f=2.16&\Rightarrow P\mbox{-value}>.10\\ f=25.03&\Rightarrow P\mbox{-value}<.001\end{array}\]

Only if \(f\) equals a tabulated value do we obtain an exact \(P\)-value (e.g., if \(f=4.53\), then \(P\mbox{-value}=.05\)). Once we know that \(.01<P\mbox{-value}<.05\), \(H_{0}\) would be rejected at a significance level of.05 but not at a level of.01. When \(P\)-value \(<.001\), \(H_{0}\) should be rejected at any reasonable significance level.

The \(F\) tests discussed in succeeding chapters will all be upper-tailed. If, however, a lower-tailed \(F\) test is appropriate, then (6.15) should be used to obtain lower-tailed critical values so that a bound or bounds on the \(P\)-value can be established. In the case of a two-tailed test, the bound or bounds from a one-tailed test should be multiplied by 2. For example, if \(f=5.82\) when \(v_{1}=4\) and \(v_{2}=6\), then since 5.82 falls between the.05 and.01 critical values, 2(.01) \(<P\mbox{-value}<2\)(.05), giving.02 \(<P\mbox{-value}<.10\). \(H_{0}\) would then be rejected if \(\alpha=.10\)

Figure 10.10: A \(P\)-value for an upper–tailed \(F\) test

but not if \(\alpha=.01\). In this case, we cannot say from our table what conclusion is appropriate when \(\alpha=.05\) (since we don't know whether the \(P\)-value is smaller or larger than this). However, statistical software shows that the area to the right of 5.82 under this \(F\) curve is.029, so the \(P\)-value is.058 and the null hypothesis should therefore not be rejected at level.05 (.058 is the smallest \(\alpha\) for which \(H_{0}\) can be rejected and our chosen \(\alpha\) is smaller than this).

## Appendix A Confidence Interval for \(\sigma_{1}/\sigma_{2}\)

The CI for \(\sigma_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\) is based on replacing \(F\) in the probability statement

\[P(F_{1-\alpha/2,v_{1},v_{2}}<\!F<\!F_{\alpha/2,v_{1},v_{2}})=1-\alpha\]

by the \(F\) variable (10.8) and manipulating the inequalities to isolate \(\sigma_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\):

\[\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{F_{\alpha/2,v_{1},v_{2}}}<\frac{ \sigma_{1}^{2}}{\sigma_{2}^{2}}<\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{F_{ 1-\alpha/2,v_{1},v_{2}}}=\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\cdot F_{\alpha/2,v_{2},v _{1}}\]

Equation (6.15) has been used here to simplify the upper bound and enable use of Table A.8. Thus the confidence interval for \(\sigma_{1}^{2}/\sigma_{2}^{2}\) is

\[\left(\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{F_{\alpha/2,m-1,n-1}},\frac{s_{1 }^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\cdot F_{\alpha/2,n-1,m-1}\right)\]

An interval for \(\sigma_{1}/\sigma_{2}\) results from taking the square root of each limit:

\[\left(\frac{s_{1}}{s_{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2,m-1,n-1}}},\frac{s_{1 }}{s_{2}}\cdot\sqrt{F_{\alpha/2,n-1,m-1}}\right)\]

In the interval for the ratio of population variances, notice that the limits of the interval are proportional to the ratio of sample variances. Of course, the lower limit is less than the ratio of sample variances, and the upper limit is greater.

Figure 10.11: Obtaining \(P\)-value information from the \(F\) table for an upper-tailed \(F\) test

Let's find a confidence interval using the data of Example 10.14. The sample standard deviations are \(s_{1}=6.765\) for 6 Bruegger's bagels, and \(s_{2}=2.338\) for 8 Wolferman English muffins. Then a 98% confidence interval for the ratio \(\sigma_{1}/\sigma_{2}\) is \[\left(\frac{6.765}{2.338}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{F_{.01,5,7}}},\frac{6.765}{2.338} \cdot\sqrt{F_{.01,7,5}}\right) =\left(2.89\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{7.46}},\ 2.89\cdot\sqrt{10.46}\right)\] \[=\left(1.06,\ 9.35\right)\] Because 1 is not included in the interval, it suggests that the two standard deviations differ. By comparing the CI calculation with the hypothesis test calculation, it should be clear that a two-tailed test would reject equality at the 2% level, and this is consistent with the results of Example 10.14. 

It is important to emphasize that the methods of this section are strongly dependent on the normality assumption. Expression 10.8 is valid only in the case of normal data or nearly normal data. Otherwise, the \(F\) distribution in (10.8) does not apply. The \(t\) procedures of this chapter are robust to the normality assumption, meaning that the procedures still work in the case of moderate departures from normality, but this is not true for comparison of variances based on (10.8).

### Comparisons Using the Bootstrap and Permutation Methods

In this chapter we have discussed how to make comparisons based on normal data. We have also considered comparisons of means when the sample sizes are large enough for the means to be approximately normal. What about all other cases, especially small skewed data sets?

We now consider the bootstrap technique for forming confidence intervals and permutation tests for testing hypotheses. As described in Section 8.5, bootstrapping involves a lot of computation. The same will be true here for bootstrap confidence intervals and for permutation tests.

### The Bootstrap for Two Samples

The bootstrap for two samples is similar to the one-sample bootstrap of Section 8.5, except that samples with replacement are taken from the two groups separately. That is, a sample is taken from the first group, a separate sample is taken from the second group, and then the difference of means or some other comparison statistic is computed. This process is repeated until there are 999 (or another large number) values of the comparison statistic, and this constitutes the _bootstrap sample_. The distribution of the bootstrap sample is called the _bootstrap distribution_.

If the bootstrap distribution appears normal, then a confidence interval can be computed by using the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution in place of the square root expression in the theorem of Section 10.2. That is, instead of estimating the standard error for the difference of means from the two sample standard deviations, we use the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution. The idea is that the bootstrap distribution should represent the actual sampling distribution for the difference of means.

However, if the bootstrap distribution does not look normal, then the _percentile interval_ should be calculated, just as was done in Section 8.5. Assuming a bootstrap sample of size 999, this involves sorting the 999 bootstrap values, finding the 25th from the bottom and the 25th from the top, and using these values as confidence limits for a 95% CI. The bias corrected and adjusted interval is a further refinement available in some software, including R, Stata, and Systat.

As an example of the bootstrap for two samples, consider data from a study of children talking to themselves (private speech), introduced in Example 1.2. The children were each observed in many 10-s intervals (about 100) and the researchers computed the percentage of intervals in which private speech occurred. Because private speech tends to occur when there is a challenging task, the students were observed when they were doing arithmetic. The private speech is classified as on task if it is about arithmetic, off task if it is about something else, and mumbling if the subject is not clear.

Each child was observed in the first, second, and third grades, but we will consider here just the first grade off-task private speech. For the 18 boys and 15 girls here are the percentages:

\[\text{B: 4.9, 5.5, 6.5, 0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 2.8, 6.4, 1.0, 0.9, 0.0, 28.1, 8.7, 1.6, 5.1, 17.0, 4.7, 28.1}\] \[\text{G: 0.0, 1.3, 2.2, 0.0, 1.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3.9, 0.0, 10.1, 5.2, 3.2, 0.0.}\]

With the large number of zeroes, a majority for the girls, the normality assumption of Section 10.2 does not apply here. Also, the sample sizes for the two groups are not very large, so the two-sample \(z\) methods of Section 10.1 might not work for this data set. Nevertheless, it is useful to give the \(t\) CI for comparison purposes. The 95% interval is

\[\overline{x}-\overline{y}\pm t_{.025,t}\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{18} +\frac{s_{2}^{2}}{15}} =6.906-1.813\pm 2.080\sqrt{\frac{8.719^{2}}{18}+\frac{2.846^{2}}{15}}\] \[=5.093\pm 2.080(2.1825)=5.093\pm 4.540=(.55,\ 9.63)\]

The degrees of freedom \(v=21\) come from the messy formula in the theorem of Section 10.2. The confidence interval does not include 0, which implies that we would reject the hypothesis \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\) against a two-tailed alternative at the.05 level. This is in agreement with what we get in testing this hypothesis directly: \(t=2.33,P\)-value.030.

The \(t\) method is of questionable validity, because of sample sizes that might not be enough to compensate for the nonnormality. The bootstrap method involves drawing a random sample of size 18 with replacement from the 18 boys, drawing a random sample of size 15 with replacement from the 15 girls, and calculating the difference of means. Then this process is repeated to give a total of 999 differences of means. The distribution of these 999 differences of means is the bootstrap distribution.

To help clarify the procedure, here are random samples from the boys and girls:

\[\text{B: 0.0, 3.0, 2.8, 0.9, 3.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.5, 6.4, 8.7, 6.4, 1.0, 0.9, 5.5, 17.0, 17.0, 0.0, 3.0}\] \[\text{G: 1.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.3, 1.3, 0.0, 3.2, 0.0, 1.3, 5.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0}.\]

Of course, in sampling with replacement some values will occur more than once and some will not occur at all. For these two samples, the difference of means is \(4.56-.91=3.65\). Doing this 999 times (using the R package boot) gives the bootstrap distribution displayed in Figure 10.12.

The distribution looks almost normal, but with some positive skewness. The idea of the bootstrap, with its samples taken from the original samples of boys and girls, is for this histogram to resemble the true distribution of the difference of means. If the original samples of boys and girls are representative of their populations, then our histogram should be a reasonable imitation of the population distribution for the difference of means.

In spite of the nonnormality of the bootstrap distribution, we will use its standard deviation to compute a confidence interval to see how much it differs from the percentile interval. The standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution (i.e., of the 999 \(\overline{x}-\overline{y}\) values) is \(s_{\text{boot}}=2.1874\), very close to the 2.1825 that was computed for the square root in the \(t\) interval above. Using 2.1874 instead of 2.1825 gives the 95% confidence interval

\[\overline{x}-\overline{y}\pm z_{.025}s_{\text{boot}}=6.906-1.813\pm 1.96(2.1874)=5.093 \pm 4.287=(.81,\,9.38)\]

This is very similar to the \(t\) interval, (.55, 9.63), except that using \(z_{.025}\) (common bootstrap practice) instead of \(t_{.025,\text{v}}\) shortens the interval. Note that the R package boot produces a slightly different interval because it replaces the difference 5.093 with the average of the 999 bootstrap mean differences.

In the presence of a nonnormal bootstrap distribution, we now use the percentile interval, which for a 95% confidence interval finds the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution. The confidence limits for a 95% confidence interval are the 2.5 percentile and the 97.5 percentile. When the 999 bootstrap differences of means are sorted, the 25th value from the bottom is 1.029 and the 25th value from the top is 9.760. This gives a 95% CI (1.029, 9.760). The skewness of the bootstrap distribution pushes the endpoints a little to the right of the endpoints computed from \(s_{\text{boot}}\). In addition, one can compute the bias corrected and accelerated refinement, as discussed in Section 8.5. The improved interval (1.625, 10.446), obtained from R, is moved even farther to the right compared to the previous intervals.

## Permutation Tests

How should we test hypotheses when the validity of the \(t\) test is in doubt? Permutation tests do not require any specific distribution for the data. The idea is that under the null hypothesis, every observation has the same distribution and thus the same expected value, so we can rearrange the group labels without changing the group population means. We look at all possible arrangements, compute the difference of means for each of these, and compute a _P_-value by seeing how extreme is our original difference of means. That is, the _P_-value is the fraction of arrangements that are at least as extreme as the value computed for the original data.

Consider a small-scale version of the off-task private speech data. The first three values for the boys are 4.9, 5.5, 6.5 and the first two values for the girls are 0.0, 1.3. To demonstrate the permutation test, we will act as if this is the whole data set. First, we compute the difference of means of the boys versus the girls, 5.63 --.65 = 4.98. Under the null hypothesis of equal population means, it should not matter if we reassign boys and girls. Therefore, we consider all ways of selecting three from among the five observations to be in the boys sample, leaving the other two for the girls sample. Under the null hypothesis, the following ten choices are equally likely.

\[\begin{array}{lcccccccc} \hline & \mathbf{Boys} & \mathbf{\bar{x}} & \mathbf{Girls} & \mathbf{\bar{y}} & \mathbf{\bar{x}} - \mathbf{\bar{y}} \\ \hline 4.9&5.5&6.5&5.63&0.0&1.3&.65&4.98\\ 4.9&5.5&0.0&3.47&6.5&1.3&3.90&-.43\\ 4.9&5.5&1.3&3.90&0.0&6.5&3.25&.65\\ 4.9&6.5&0.0&3.80&5.5&1.3&3.40&.40\\ 4.9&6.5&1.3&4.23&5.5&0.0&2.75&1.48\\ 4.9&0.0&1.3&2.07&5.5&6.5&6.00&-3.93\\ 5.5&6.5&0.0&4.00&4.9&1.3&3.10&.90\\ 5.5&6.5&1.3&4.43&4.9&0.0&2.45&1.98\\ 5.5&0.0&1.3&2.27&6.5&4.9&5.70&-3.43\\ 6.5&0.0&1.3&2.60&5.5&4.9&5.20&-2.60\\ \hline\end{array}\]

How extreme is our original difference of means (4.98) in this set of ten differences? Because it is the largest of ten, our _P_-value for an upper-tailed alternative hypothesis is \(\frac{1}{10}=.10\). That is, for an upper-tailed test the _P_-value is the fraction of arrangements that give a difference at least as large as our original difference. For a two-tailed test we simply double the one-tailed _P_-value, giving \(P=.20\) for this example.

When \(m\) = 3 and \(n\) = 2, it is simple enough to deal with all \(\binom{5}{3}=10\) arrangements. What happens when we try to use the whole set of 18 boys and 15 girls in the private speech data set?

Consider a permutation test for the full private speech data. Here we are dealing with \(\binom{33}{18}=1,\)037,158,320 arrangements of the 18 boys and 15 girls, more than a billion arrangements. Even on a reasonably fast computer it might take a while to generate this many differences and see how many are at least as big as the value\(\pi-\overline{y}=6.906-1.813=5.093\) computed for the original data. It took around an hour on an 800 mhz Dell using the free program BLOSSOM, which can be downloaded from the Internet. The two-tailed \(P\)-value is.0203, a little less than the \(P\)-value.030 from the \(t\) test. There is fairly strong evidence, at least at the 5% level, that the boys engage in more off-task private speech than the girls.

We might have expected that the hypothesis test would reject the null hypothesis (of zero difference in means) at the 5% level with a two-tailed test. Recall that all three of our 95% confidence intervals in Example 10.16 consisted of only positive values, so none of the intervals included zero.

The number of arrangements goes up very quickly as the group sizes increase. If there are 20 boys and 20 girls, then the number of arrangements is more than 100 times as big as when there are 18 boys and 15 girls. Doing the test exactly, using all of the arrangements, becomes entirely impractical, but there is an approximate alternative. We can take a random sample of a few thousand arrangements and get quite close to the exact answer. For example, with our 18 boys and 15 girls, BLOSSOM gives (almost instantaneously) a \(P\)-value of.0204, which is certainly close enough to the exact answer of.0203. An approximate computation is also available in R (in the boot package) and Stata and can easily be programmed in other software such as MINITAB.

\begin{tabular}{c c} PERMUTATION TESTS & Let \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\) be the same parameters (means, medians, standard deviations, etc.) for two different populations, and consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\theta_{1}=\theta_{2}\) based on independent samples of sizes \(m\) and \(n\), respectively. Suppose that when \(H_{0}\) is true, the two population distributions are identical in all respects, so all \(m+n\) observations have actually been selected from the same population distribution. In this case, the labels 1 and 2 are arbitrary, as any \(m\) of the \(m+n\) observations have the same chance of ending up in the first sample (leaving the remaining \(n\) for the second sample). An exact permutation test computes a suitable comparison statistic for all possible rearrangements, and sets the \(P\)-value equal to the fraction of these that are at least as extreme as the statistic computed on the original samples. This is the \(P\)-value for a one-tailed test, and it needs to be doubled for a two-tailed test. For an approximate permutation test, instead of all possible arrangements, we take a random sample with replacement from the set of all possible arrangements. \\ \end{tabular}

Permutation tests are nonparametric, meaning that they do not assume a specific underlying distribution such as the normal distribution. However, this does not mean that there are no assumptions whatsoever. The null hypothesis in a permutation test is that the two distributions are the same, and any deviation can increase the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. Thus, strictly speaking, we are doing a test for equal means only if the distributions are alike in all other respects, and this means that the two distributions have the same shape. In particular, it requires the distributions to have the same spread. See Exercise 84 for an example in which the permutation test underestimates the true \(P\)-value.

## References About Variability

Section 10.5 discussed the use of the \(F\) distribution for comparing two variances, but this inferential method is strongly dependent on normality. For highly skewed data the \(F\) test for equal variances will tend to reject the null hypothesis too often.

Consider the off-task private speech data from Example 10.16. The sample standard deviations for boys and girls are 8.72 and 2.85, respectively. Then the method of Section 10.5 gives for the ratio of male to female variances the 95% confidence interval

\[\left(\frac{s_{1}^{2}}{s_{2}^{2}}\frac{1}{F._{025,17,14}}\,,\,\frac{s_{1}^{2}} {s_{2}^{2}}\frac{1}{F._{975,17,14}}\right)=\,\left(\frac{8.72^{2}}{2.85^{2}} \frac{1}{2.900}\,,\,\,\frac{8.72^{2}}{2.85^{2}}\frac{1}{.3633}\right)=\left(3.23,\,25.77\right)\]

Taking the square root gives (1.80, 5.08) as the 95% confidence interval for the ratio of standard deviations. However, the legitimacy of this interval is seriously in question because of the skewed distributions.

What about a hypothesis test of equal population variances? The ratio of male variance to female variance is \(s_{1}^{2}/s_{2}^{2}=8.72^{2}/2.85^{2}=9.385\). Comparing this to the \(F\) distribution with 17 numerator degrees of freedom and 14 denominator degrees of freedom, we find that the one-tailed _P_-value is.000061, and therefore the two-tailed _P_-value is.00012. This is consistent with the 95% confidence interval not including 1. It would be strong evidence for the male variance being greater than the female variance, except that the validity of the test is in doubt because of nonnormality.

Figure 10.13: Histogram and normal plot of bootstrap standard deviation ratios from RLet's apply the bootstrap to this problem. Begin with a sample from the boys, standard deviation 5.264, and a sample from the girls, standard deviation 1.505, with ratio 5.264/1.505 = 3.498. We do this 999 times using the boot package in R, and the resulting distribution of ratios is shown in Figure 10.13.

The bootstrap distribution is strongly skewed to the right. For a 95% confidence interval, the percentile method uses the middle 95% of the bootstrap distribution. The 2.5 percentile is 1.013 and the 97.5 percentile is 7.888, so the 95% confidence interval for the population ratio of standard deviations is (1.013, 7.888). The bias corrected and accelerated (BCa) refinement gives the interval (0.885, 7.382). These two intervals differ in an important respect, that the percentile interval excludes 1 but the BCa refinement includes 1. In other words, the BCa interval allows the possibility that the two standard deviations are the same, but the percentile interval does not. We expect the BCa method to be an improvement, and this is verified in the next example, where we see that the BCa result is consistent with the results of a permutation test. 

Consider using a permutation test for \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}\).

From Example 10.19 we know that the ratio of sample standard deviations for off-task private speech, males versus females, is 8.72/2.85 = 3.064. The idea of the permutation test is to find out how unusual this value is if we blur the distinction between males and females. That is, we remove the labels from the 18 males and 15 females and then consider all possible choices of 18 from the 33 children. For each of these possible choices we find the ratio of the standard deviation of the first 18 to the standard deviation of the last 15. The one-tailed \(P\)-value is the fraction that are at least as big as the original value, 3.064. Because there are more than a billion possible choices of 18 from 33, we instead selected 4999 random choices. This gives a total of 5000 when the original selection of males and females is included. Of these, 432 are at least as big as 3.064, so the one-tailed \(P\)-value is 432/5000 =.0864. For a two-tailed \(P\)-value we double this and get.1728. The permutation test does not reject at the 5% level (or the 10% level) the null hypothesis that the two population standard deviations are the same.

How does the permutation test result compare with the other results? Recall that the \(F\) interval and the percentile interval ruled out the possibility that the two standard deviations are the same, but the BCa refinement disagreed, because 1 is included in the BCa interval. Taking it for granted that the permutation test is a valid approach and the permutation test does not reject the equality of standard deviations, the BCa interval is the only one of the three CIs consistent with this result. 

## The Analysis of Paired Data

The bootstrap can be used for paired data if we work with the paired differences, as in the paired \(t\) methods of Section 10.3.

The private speech study was introduced in Examples 1.2 and 10.16. The study included the percentage of intervals with on-task private speech for 33 children in the first, second, and third grades. Here we will consider just the 15 girls in the first and second grades. Is there a change in on-task private speech when the girls go from the first to the second grade? Here are the percentages of intervals in which on task private speech occurred, and also the differences.

Our null hypothesis is that the population mean difference between first- and second-grade percentages is zero. Figure 10.14 shows a histogram for the differences, and it shows a negatively skewed distribution.

The paired \(t\) method of Section 10.3 requires normality, so the skewness might invalidate this, but we will show the results here anyway for comparison purposes. The mean of the differences is \(\overline{d}=16.66\) with standard deviation \(s_{D}=15.43\), so the 95% confidence interval for the population mean difference is

\[\overline{d}\pm t_{.025,15-1}\frac{s_{D}}{\sqrt{15}}=16.66\pm 2.145\frac{15.43}{ \sqrt{15}}=16.66\pm 8.54=(8.12,\,25.20)\]

What about the bootstrap for paired data? The bootstrap focuses on the 15 differences and uses the method of Section 8.5. Using Stata, we draw 999 samples of size 15 with replacement from the 15 differences, and these 999 samples constitute the bootstrap distribution. Figure 10.15 shows the histogram.

Figure 10.14: Histogram of differences for girls from Stata

The histogram shows negative skewness, which is expected because of the negative skewness shown in Figure 10.14 for the original sample. The skewness implies that a symmetric confidence interval will not be entirely appropriate, but we show it for comparison with the other intervals. The standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution is \(s_{\text{boot}}=3.994\), compared to the estimated standard error \(s_{D}/\sqrt{15}=15.43/\sqrt{15}=3.984\). The 95% bootstrap confidence interval is narrower because of using \(z_{.025}\) instead of \(t_{.025,15-1}\).

\[\overline{d}\pm z_{.025}s_{\text{boot}}=16.66\pm 1.96(3.994)=16.66\pm 7.83=(8.83, 24.49)\]

This is slightly different from what Stata produces, because it uses \(t_{.025,B-1}=t_{.025,999-1}\).where \(B\) is the size of the bootstrap sample.

The 95% percentile interval uses the 2.5 percentile = 7.91 and the 97.5 percentile = 23.97 of the bootstrap distribution, so the confidence interval is (7.91, 23.97). This interval is to the left of the \(t\) intervals because of the negative skewness of the bootstrap distribution. The bias corrected and accelerated refinement from Stata yields the interval (6.43, 23.12), which is even farther to the left.

All of the intervals agree that there is a substantial population difference between first grade and second grade. There is a strong reduction in the on-task private speech of girls between first and second grades.

A permutation test for paired data involves permutations within the pairs. Under the null hypothesis, the two observations in a pair have the same population mean, so the population mean difference is zero, even if the order is reversed. Therefore, we consider all possible orderings of the \(n\) pairs. Because there are two possible orderings within each pair, there are \(2^{n}\) arrangements of \(n\) pairs. The one-tailed \(P\)-value is the fraction of the \(2^{n}\) differences that are at least as extreme as the observed value, and the two-tailed \(P\)-value is double this.

Figure 10.15: Histogram of bootstrap differences for girls from Stata

To see how the permutation test works for paired data, consider a scaled-down version of the data from Example 10.21 with only the first three pairs. These are (25.7, 18.6), (36.0, 17.4), (27.6, 2.6). They give a mean difference of (7.1 + 18.6 + 25.0)/3 = 16.9. Here are all 8 = 23 permutations with the corresponding means.

\[\begin{array}{l} \hline \text{\bf{Arrangements}} & \text{\bf{Mean difference}} \\ \hline (25.7,18.6) &(36.0,17.4) &(27.6,2.6) &16.90 \\ (25.7,18.6) &(36.0,17.4) &(2.6,27.6) &.23 \\ (25.7,18.6) &(17.4,36.0) &(27.6,2.6) &4.50 \\ (25.7,18.6) &(17.4,36.0) &(2.6,27.6) &-12.17 \\ (18.6,25.7) &(36.0,17.4) &(27.6,2.6) &12.17 \\ (18.6,25.7) &(36.0,17.4) &(2.6,27.6) &-4.50 \\ (18.6,25.7) &(17.4,36.0) &(27.6,2.6) &-.23 \\ (18.6,25.7) &(17.4,36.0) &(2.6,27.6) &-16.90 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

Because the mean difference for the original sample is the highest value of eight, the one-tailed _P_-value is \(\frac{1}{8}=.125\), and the two-tailed _P_-value is \(2\big{(}\frac{1}{8}\big{)}=.25\).

Let's now apply the permutation test to the paired data for the 15 girls of Example 10.21. In principle it is no harder to deal with the 2\({}^{n}=2^{15}=32\),768 arrangements when all 15 pairs are included, but this exact approach is generally approximated using a random sample. We used Stata to draw an additional 4999 samples. Of the 4999, none yielded a mean difference as large as the value of 16.66 obtained for the original sample of 15 differences. Therefore, the one-tailed _P_-value is \(\frac{1}{5000}=.0002\), and the two-tailed _P_-value is \(2(.0002)=.0004\). Rejection of the null hypothesis at the 5% level was to be expected, given that none of the confidence intervals in Example 10.21 included 0.

It is interesting to compare the permutation test result with the \(t\) test of Section 10.3. For testing the null hypothesis of 0 population mean difference, the value of \(t\) is

\[\frac{\overline{d}-0}{s_{D}/\sqrt{15}}=\frac{16.66}{15.425/\sqrt{15}}=4.183\]

The two-tailed _P_-value for this is.0009, not very different from the result of the permutation test.

## 11.

* A student project by Heather Kral studied students on "lifestyle floors" of a dormitory in comparison to students on other floors. On a lifestyle floor the students share a common major, and there are a faculty coordinator and resident assistant from that department. Here are the grade point averages of 30 students on lifestyle floors (L) and 30 students on other floors (N): L: 2.00, 2.25, 2.60, 2.90, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.00, 3.20, 3.20, 3.25, 3.30, 3.30, 3.32, 3.50, 3.60, 3.60, 3.70, 3.75, 3.75, 3.79, 3.80, 3.80, 3.90, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00, 4.00.
* N: 1.20, 2.00, 2.29, 2.45, 2.50, 2.50,Notice that the lifestyle grade point averages have a large number of repeats and the distribution is skewed, so there is some question about normality. **a.**: Obtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference of population means using the method based on the theorem of Section 10.2. **b.**: Obtain a bootstrap sample of 999 differences of means.

If they are very similar, why do you think this is the case? **f.**: Interpret your results. Is there a substantial difference between lifestyle and other floors? Why do you think the difference is as big as it is?
70. In this application from major league baseball, the populations represent an abstraction of what the players can do, so the populations will vary from year to year. The Colorado Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks played nine games in Phoenix and ten games in Denver in 2001. The thinner air in Denver causes curve balls to curve less and it allows fly balls to travel farther. Does this mean that more runs are scored in Denver? The numbers of runs scored by the two teams in the nine Phoenix games (P) and ten Denver games (D) are **c.**: Use the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution along with the mean and \(t\) critical value from (a) to get a 95% confidence interval for the difference of means. **d.**: Use the bootstrap sample and the percentile method to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference of means. **e.**: Compare your three confidence intervals. If you used a standard normal critical value in place of the \(t\) critical value in (c), why would would you want to be traded to the Rockies? **f.**: For the data of Exercise 70 we want to compare population medians for the runs in Denver versus the runs in Phoenix. **a.**: Obtain a bootstrap sample of 999 differences of medians. Check the bootstrap distribution for normality using a normal probability plot. **b.**: Use the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution along with the difference of the medians in the original sample and the \(t\) critical value from Exercise 70(a) to get a 95% confidence interval for the difference of population medians. **c.**: Use the bootstrap sample and the percentile method to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference of population medians. **d.**: Compare the two confidence intervals. **e.**: How do the results for the median compare with the results for the mean? In terms of precision (measured by the width of the confidence interval) which gives the best results?
72. For the data of Exercise 69 now consider testing the hypothesis of equal population variances. **a.**: Carry out a 2-tailed test using the method of Section 10.5. Recall that this method requires the data to be normal, and the method is sensitive to departures from normality. Check the data for normality to see if the \(F\) test is justified. **b.**: Carry out a 2-tailed permutation test for the hypothesis of equal population variances (or standard deviations). Why does it not matter whether you use variances or standard deviations? **c.**: Compare the two results and summarize your conclusions.

73. For the data of Exercise 69 we want a 95% confidence interval for the ratio of population standard deviations. * Use the method of Section 10.5. Recall that this method requires the data to be normal, and the method is sensitive to departures from normality. Check the data for normality to see if the \(F\) distribution can be used for the ratio of sample variances. * With a bootstrap sample of size 999 use the percentile method to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the ratio of standard deviations. * Compare the two results and discuss the relationship of the results to those of Exercise 72.
74. Can the right diet help us cope with diseases associated with aging such as Alzheimer's disease? A study ("Reversals of Age-Related Declines in Neuronal Signal Transduction, Cognitive, and Motor Behavioral Deficits with Blueberry, Spinach, or Strawberry Dietary Supplement," _J. Neurosci._, 1999; 8114-8121) investigated the effects of fruit and vegetable supplements in the diet of rats. The rats were 19 months old, which is aged by rat standards. The 40 rats were randomly assigned to four diets, of which we will consider just the blueberry diet and the control diet here. After 8 weeks on their diets, the rats were given a number of tests. We give the data for just one of the tests, which measured how many seconds they could walk on a rod. Here are the times for the ten control rats (C) and ten blueberry rats (B): * Determine a 95% confidence interval for the difference of population means using the method based on the Theorem of Section 10.2. * Obtain a bootstrap sample of 999 differences of means. Check the bootstrap distribution for normality using a normal probability plot. * Use the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution along with the mean and \(t\) critical value from (a) to get a 95% confidence interval for the difference of means. * Use the bootstrap sample and the percentile method to obtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference of means. * Compare your three confidence intervals. If they are very similar, why do you think this is the case? If you had used a critical value from the normal table rather than the \(t\) table, would the result of (c) agree better with the result of (d)? Why? * Interpret your results. Do the blueberries make a substantial difference?
75. For the data of Exercise 74, we now want to test the hypothesis of equal population means. * Carry out a 2-tailed test using the method based on the theorem of Section 10.2. Although this test requires normal data, it will still work pretty well for moderately nonnormal data. Nevertheless, you should check the data for normality to see if the test is justified. * Carry out a 2-tailed permutation test for the hypothesis of equal population means. * Compare the results of (a) and (b). Would you expect them to be similar for the data of this problem? Discuss their relationship to the results of Exercise 74. Summarize your conclusions about the effectiveness of blueberries.
76. Researchers at the University of Alaska have been trying to find inexpensive feed sources for Alaska reindeer growers ("Effects of Two Barley-Based Diets on Body Mass and Intake Rates of Captive Reindeer During Winter," Poster Presentation: School of Agriculture and Land Resources Management, University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2002). They are focusing on Alaska-grown barley because commercially available feed supplies are too expensive for farmers. Typically, reindeer lose weight in the fall and winter, and the researchers are trying to find a feed to minimize this loss. Thirteen pregnant reindeer were randomly divided into two groups to be fed on two different varieties of barley, thual and finaska. Here are the weight gains between October 1 and December 15 for the seven that were fed thual barley (T) and the six that were fed finaska barley (F). * The weight gains are all negative, indicating that all of the animals lost weight. The thual barley is less fibrous and more digestible, and the intake rates for the two varieties of barley were very nearly the same, so the experimenters expected less weight loss for the thual variety. * Determine a 95% confidence interval for the difference of population means using the method given in the theorem of Section 10.2.

**b.**: Obtain a bootstrap sample of 999 differences of means. Check the bootstrap distribution for normality using a normal probability plot.

**81.**: Two students, Miguel Melo and Cody Watson, did a study of textbook pricing. They compared prices at the campus bookstore and Amazon.com. To be fair, they included the sales tax for the local store and added shipping for Amazon. Here are the prices for a sample of 27 books.

## Supplementary Exercises (85-113)

* A group of 115 University of Iowa students was randomly divided into a build-up condition group (_m_ = 56) and a scale-down condition group (_n_ = 59). The task for each subject was to build his or her own pizza from a menu of 12 ingredients. The build-up group was told that a basic cheese pizza costs $5 and that each extra ingredient would cost 50 cents. The scale-down group was told that a pizza with all 12 ingredients (ugh!!!) would cost $11 and that deleting an ingredient would save 50 cents. The article "A Tale of Two Pizzas: Building Up from a Basic Product Versus Scaling Down from a Fully Loaded Product" (_Market. Lett._, 2002: 335-344) reported that the mean number of ingredients selected by the scale-down group was significantly greater than the mean number for the build-up group: 5.29 versus 2.71. The calculated value of the appropriate \(t\) statistic was 6.07. Would you reject the null hypothesis of equality in favor of inequality at a significance level of.057.01?.001? Can you think of other products aside from pizza where one could build up or scale down? [_Note_: A separate experiment involved students from the University of Rome, but details were a bit different because there are typically not so many ingredient choices in Italy.]
86. Is the number of export markets in which a firm sells its products related to the firm's return on sales? The article "Technology Industry Success: Strategic Options for Small and Medium Firms" (Gongming Qian, Lee Li, _Bus_. _Horizons_, Sept.-Oct. 2003: 41-46) gave the accompanying information on the number of export markets for one group of firms whose return on sales was less than 10% and another group whose return was at least 10%. The investigators reported that an appropriate test of hypotheses resulted in a _P_-value between.01 and.05. What hypotheses do you think were tested, and do you agree with the stated _P_-value information? What assumptions if any are needed in order to carry out the test? Can the plausibility of these assumptions be investigated based just on the foregoing summary data? Explain.
87. Suppose when using a two-sample \(t\) CI or test that \(m\) < \(n\), and show that df > \(m\) - 1. This is why some authors suggest using min(_m_ - 1, \(n\) - 1) as df in place of the formula given in the text. What impact does this have on the CI and test procedure?
88. The accompanying summary data on compression strength (lb) for 12 x 10 x 8 in. boxes appeared in the article "Compression of Single-Wall Corrugated Shipping Containers Using Fixed and Floating Test Platens" (_J. Testing Eval._, 1992: 318-320). The authors stated that "the difference between the compression strength using fixed and floating platen method was found to be small compared to normal variation in compression strength between identical boxes." Do you agree?

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline  & **Sample** & **Sample** & **Sample** \\
**Method** & **Size** & **Mean** & **SD** \\ \hline Fixed & 10 & 807 & 27 \\ Floating & 10 & 757 & 41 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
89. The authors of the article "Dynamics of Canopy Structure and Light Interception in _Pinus elliotti_, North Florida" (_Ecol_. _Monogr._, 1991: 33-51) planned an experiment to determine the effect of fertilizer on a measure of leaf area. A number of plots were available for the study, and half were selected at random to be fertilized. To ensure that the plots to receive the fertilizer and the control plots were similar, before beginning the experiment tree density (the number of trees per hectare) was recorded for eight plots to be fertilized and eight control plots, resulting in the given data. MINITAB output follows.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} _Fertilizer plots_ & 1024 & 1216 & 1312 & 1280 \\  & 1216 & 1312 & 992 & 1120 \\ _Control plots_ & 1104 & 1072 & 1088 & 1328 \\  & 1376 & 1280 & 1120 & 1200 \\ \hline Two sample T for fertilize vs. control & N & Mean & StDev & SE Mean \\ fertilize & 8 & 1184 & 126 & 44 \\ control & 8 & 1196 & 118 & 42 \\ \hline

**a.** Construct a comparative boxplot and comment on any interesting features. & **b.** Would you conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean tree density for fertilizer and control plots? Use \(a\) =.05. & **c.** Interpret the given confidence interval.
90. Is the response rate for questionnaires affected by including some sort of incentive to respond along with the questionnaire? In one experiment, 110 questionnaires with no incentive resulted in 75 being returned, whereas 98 questionnaires that included a chance to win a lottery yielded 66 responses ("Charities, No; Lotteries, No; Cash, Yes," _Public Opinion Q._, 1996: 542-562). Does this data suggest that including an incentive increases the likelihood of a response? State and test the relevant hypotheses at significance level.10 by using the _P_-value method.
91. The article "Quantitative MRI and Electrophysiology of Preoperative Carpal Tunnel Syndrome in a Female Population" (_Ergonomics_, 1997: 642-649) reported that (-473.3, 1691.9) was a large-sample 95% confidence interval for the difference between true average thenar muscle volume (mm3) for sufferers of carpal tunnel syndrome and true average volume for nonsufferers. Calculate and interpret a 90% confidence interval for this difference.

92. The following summary data on bending strength (lb-in/in) of joints is taken from the article "Bending Strength of Corner Joints Constructed with Injection Molded Splines" (_Forest Products J._, April 1997: 89-92). Assume normal distributions. * Calculate a 95% lower confidence bound for true average strength of joints with a side coating. * Calculate a 95% lower prediction bound for the strength of a single joint with a side coating. * Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between true average strengths for the two types of joints. * An experiment was carried out to compare various properties of cotton/polyester spun yarn finished with softener only and yarn finished with softener plus 5% DP-resin ("Properties of a Fabric Made with Tandem Spun Yarns," _Textile Res. J._, 1996: 607-611). One particularly important characteristic of fabric is its durability, that is, its ability to resist wear. For a sample of 40 softener-only specimens, the sample mean stoll-flex abrasion resistance (cycles) in the filling direction of the yarn was 3975.0, with a sample standard deviation of 245.1. Another sample of 40 softener-plus specimens gave a sample mean and sample standard deviation of 2795.0 and 293.7, respectively. Calculate a confidence interval with confidence level 99% for the difference between true average abrasion resistances for the two types of fabrics. Does your interval provide convincing evidence that true average resistances differ for the two types of fabrics? Why or why not? * The derailment of a freight train due to the catastrophic failure of a traction motor armature bearing provided the impetus for a study reported in the article "Locomotive Traction Motor Armature Bearing Life Study" (_Lubricat. Engrg._, Aug. 1997: 12-19). A sample of 17 high-mileage traction motors was selected, and the amount of cone penetration (mm/10) was determined both for the pinion bearing and for the commutator armature bearing, resulting in the following data: * Calculate an estimate of the population mean difference between penetration for the commutator armature bearing and penetration for the pinion bearing, and do so in a way that conveys information about the reliability and precision of the estimate. [_Note_: A normal probability plot validates the necessary normality assumption.] Would you say that the population mean difference has been precisely estimated? Does it look as though population mean penetration differs for the two types of bearings? Explain. * The article "Two Parameters Limiting the Sensitivity of Laboratory Tests of Condoms as Viral Barriers" (_J. Test. Eval._, 1996: 279-286) reported that, in brand A condoms, among 16 tears produced by a puncturing needle, the sample mean tear length was 74.0 \(\mu\)m, whereas for the 14 brand B tears, the sample mean length was 61.0 \(\mu\)m (determined using light microscopy and scanning electron micrographs). Suppose the sample standard deviations are 14.8 and 12.5, respectively (consistent with the sample ranges given in the article). The authors commented that the thicker brand B condom displayed a smaller mean tear length than the thinner brand A condom. Is this difference in fact statistically significant? State the appropriate hypotheses and test at \(\alpha =.05\). * Information about hand posture and forces generated by the fingers during manipulation of various daily objects is needed for designing high-tech hand prosthetic devices. The article "Grip Posture and Forces During Holding Cylindrical Objects with Circular Grips" (_Ergonomics_, 1996: 1163-1176) reported that for a sample of 11 females, the sample mean four-finger pinch strength (N) was 98.1 and the sample standard deviation was 14.2. For a sample of 15 males, the sample mean and sample standard deviation were 129.2 and 39.1, respectively. * A test carried out to see whether true average strengths for the two genders were different resulted in \(t=2.51\) and \(P\)-value \(=.019\). Does the appropriate test procedure described in this chapter yield this value of \(t\) and the stated \(P\)-value? **b.** Is there substantial evidence for concluding that true average strength for males exceeds that for females by more than 25 N? State and test the relevant hypotheses.
97. The article "Pine Needles as Sensors of Atmospheric Pollution" (_Environ. Monitor._, 1982: 273-286) reported on the use of neutron-activity analysis to determine pollutant concentration in pine needles. According to the article's authors, "These observations strongly indicated that for those elements which are determined well by the analytical procedures, the distribution of concentration is lognormal. Accordingly, in tests of significance the logarithms of concentrations will be used." The given data refers to bromine concentration in needles taken from a site near an oil-fired steam plant and from a relatively clean site. The summary values are means and standard deviations of the log-transformed observations.  Let \(\mu_{1}^{*}\) be the true average _log_ concentration at the first site, and define \(\mu_{2}^{*}\) analogously for the second site. **a.** Use the pooled \(t\) test (based on assuming normality _and_ equal standard deviations) to decide at significance level.05 whether the two concentration distribution means are equal. **b.** If \(\sigma_{1}^{*}\) and \(\sigma_{2}^{*}\), the standard deviations of the two log concentration distributions, are not equal, would \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\), the means of the concentration distributions, be the same if \(\mu_{1}^{*}=\mu_{2}^{*}\)? Explain your reasoning.
98. Torsion during hip external rotation (ER) and extension may be responsible for certain kinds of injuries in golfers and other athletes. The article "Hip Rotational Velocities during the Full Golf Swing" (_J. Sport Sci. Med._, 2009: 296-299) reported on a study in which peak ER velocity and peak IR (internal rotation) velocity (both in deg/s) were determined for a sample of 15 female collegiate golfers during their swings. The following data was supplied by the article's authors. 

* Is it plausible that the differences came from a normally distributed population? **b.** The article reported that \(\text{Mean}(\pm \text{SD})=-145.3(68.0)\) for ER velocity and \(=-227.8(96.6)\) for IR velocity. Based just on this information, could a test of hypotheses about the difference between true average IR velocity and true average ER velocity be carried out? Explain. **c.** Do an appropriate hypothesis test about the difference between true average IR velocity and true average ER velocity and interpret the result.
99. The accompanying summary data on the ratio of strength to cross-sectional area for knee extensors is taken from the article "Knee Extensor and Knee Flexor Strength: Cross-Sectional Area Ratios in Young and Elderly Men" (_J. Gerontol._, 1992: M204-M210). 

Does this data suggest that the true average ratio for young men exceeds that for elderly men? Carry out a test of appropriate hypotheses using \(\alpha=.05\). Be sure to state any assumptions necessary for your analysis.

100. The accompanying data on response time appeared in the article "The Extinguishment of Fires Using Low-Flow Water Hose Streams--Part II" (_Fire Techn._, 1991: 291-320). The samples are independent, not paired. _Good_.43 1.17.37.47.68.58.50 2.75 _visibility Poor_ 1.47.80 1.58 1.53 4.33 4.23 3.25 3.22 _visibility_ The authors analyzed the data with the pooled \(t\) test. Does the use of this test appear justified? [_Hint_: Check for normality. The normal scores for \(n\) = 8 are -1.53, -.89, -.49, -.15,.15,.49,.89, and 1.53.]
101. The accompanying data on the alcohol content of wine is representative of that reported in a study in which wines from the years 1999 and 2000 were randomly selected and the actual content was determined by laboratory analysis (_London Times_, Aug. 5, 2001). _Wine_ 1 2 3 4 5 6 _Actual_ 14.2 14.5 14.0 14.9 13.6 12.6 _Label_ 14.0 14.0 13.5 15.0 13.0 12.5 The two-sample \(t\) test gives a test statistic value of.62 and a two-tailed _P_-value of.55. Does this convince you that there is no significant difference between true average actual alcohol content and true average content stated on the label? Explain.
102. The article "The Accuracy of Stated Energy Contents of Reduced-Energy, Commercially Prepared Foods" (_J. Am. Diet. Assoc._, 2010: 116-123) presented the accompanying data on vendor-stated gross energy and measured value (both in kcal) for 10 different supermarket convenience meals): _Meal_ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 _S__tated_ 180 220 190 230 200 370 250 240 80 180 _Measured_ 212 319 231 306 211 431 288 265 145 228 _Obtain a 95% confidence interval for the difference of population means. By roughly what percentage are the actual calories higher than the stated value? Note that the article calls this a convenience sample and suggests that therefore it should have limited value for inference. However, even if the ten meals were a random sample from their local store, there could still be a problem in drawing conclusions about a purchase at your store.
103. How does energy intake compare to energy expenditure? One aspect of this issue was considered in the article "Measurement of Total Energy Expenditure by the Doubly Labelled Water Method in Professional Soccer Players" (_J. Sports Sci._, 2002: 391-397), which contained the accompanying data (MJ/day). _Player_ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 _Expenditure_ 14.4 12.1 14.3 14.2 15.2 15.5 17.8 _Intake_ 14.6 9.2 11.8 11.6 12.7 15.0 16.3 Test to see whether there is a significant difference between intake and expenditure. Does the conclusion depend on whether a significance level of.05,.01, or.001 is used?
104. An experimenter wishes to obtain a CI for the difference between true average breaking strength for cables manufactured by company I and by company II. Suppose breaking strength is normally distributed for both types of cable with \(s\)1 = 30 psi and \(s\)2 = 20 psi. **a.** If costs dictate that the sample size for the type I cable should be three times the sample size for the type II cable, how many observations are required if the 99% CI is to be no wider than 20 psi? **b.** Suppose a total of 400 observations is to be made. How many of the observations should be made on type I cable samples if the width of the resulting interval is to be a minimum?
105. An experiment to determine the effects of temperature on the survival of insect eggs was described in the article "Development Rates and a Temperature-Dependent Model of Pales Weevil" (_Environ. Entomol._, 1987: 956-962). At 11\({}^{\circ}\)C, 73 of 91 eggs survived to the next stage of development. At 30\({}^{\circ}\)C, 102 of 110 eggs survived. Do the results of this experiment suggest that the survival rate (proportion surviving) differs for the two temperatures? Calculate the _P_-value and use it to test the appropriate hypotheses.
106. The insulin-binding capacity (pmol/mg protein) was measured for four different groups of rats: (1) nondiabetic, (2) untreated diabetic, (3) diabetic treated with a low dose of insulin, (4) diabetic treated with a high dose of insulin. The accompanying table gives sample sizes and sample standard deviations. Denote the sample size for the _i_th treatment by \(n_{i}\) and the sample variance by \(S_{i}^{2}(i=1,2,3,4)\). Assuming that the true variance for each treatment is \(s\)2, construct a pooled estimator of \(s\)2 that is unbiased, and verify using rulesof expected value that it is indeed unbiased. What is your estimate for the following actual data? [_Hint_: Modify the pooled estimator \(S_{p}^{2}\) from Section 10.2.]

107. Suppose a level.05 test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0\) is to be performed, assuming \(\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}=10\) and normality of both distributions, using equal sample sizes (\(m=n\)). Evaluate the probability of a type II error when \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=1\) and \(n=25\), 100, 2500, and 10,000. Can you think of real problems in which the difference \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=1\) has little practical significance? Would sample sizes of \(n=10\),000 be desirable in such problems?
108. The following data refers to airborne bacteria count (number of colonies/ft\({}^{3}\)) both for \(m=8\) carpeted hospital rooms and for \(n=8\) uncarpeted rooms ("Microbial Air Sampling in a Carpeted Hospital," \(J\). _Environ. Health_, 1968: 405). Does there appear to be a difference in true average bacteria count between carpeted and uncarpeted rooms?

_Carpeted_ 11.8 8.2 7.1 13.0 10.8 10.1 14.6 14.0 _Uncarpeted_ 12.1 8.3 3.8 7.2 12.0 11.1 10.1 13.7 Suppose you later learned that all carpeted rooms were in a veterans' hospital, whereas all uncarpeted rooms were in a children's hospital. Would you be able to assess the effect of carpeting? Comment.
109. Researchers sent 5000 resumes in response to job ads that appeared in the _Boston Globe_ and _Chicago Tribune_. The resumes were identical except that 2500 of them had "white sounding" first names, such as Brett and Emily, whereas the other 2500 had "black sounding" names such as Tamika and Rasheed. The resumes of the first type elicited 250 responses and the resumes of the second type only 167 responses (these numbers are very consistent with information that appeared in a January 15, 2003, report by the Associated Press). Does this data strongly suggest that a resume with a "black" name is less likely to result in a response than is a resume with a "white" name?
110. McNemar's test, developed in Exercise 55, can also be used when individuals are paired (matched) to yield \(n\) pairs and then one member of each pair is given treatment 1 and the other is given treatment 2. Then \(X_{1}\) is the number of pairs in which both treatments were successful, and similarly for \(X_{2}\), \(X_{3}\), and \(X_{4}\). The test statistic for testing equal efficacy of the two treatments is given by \((X_{2}-X_{3})/\sqrt{X_{2}+X_{3}}\), which has approximately a standard normal distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true. Use this to test whether the drug ergotamine is effective in the treatment of migraine headaches.

The data is fictitious, but the conclusion agrees with that in the article "Controlled Clinical Trial of Ergotamine Tartrate" (_British Med. J._, 1970: 325-327).
111. Let \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{m}\) be a random sample from a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda_{1}\), and let \(Y_{1}\),..., \(Y_{n}\) be a random sample from another Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda_{2}\). We wish to test \(H_{0}\): \(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}=0\) against one of the three standard alternatives. Since \(\mu=\lambda\) for a Poisson distribution, when \(m\) and \(n\) are large the large-sample \(z\) test of Section 10.1 can be used. However, the fact that \(V(\overline{X})=\lambda/n\) suggests that a different denominator should be used in standardizing \(\overline{X}-\overline{Y}\). Develop a large-sample test procedure appropriate to this problem, and then apply it to the following data to test whether the plant densities for a particular species are equal in two different regions (where each observation is the number of plants found in a randomly located square sampling quadrat having area 1 m\({}^{2}\), so for region 1, there were 40 quadrats in which one plant was observed, etc.):112. Referring to Exercise 111, develop a large-sample confidence interval formula for \(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}\). Calculate the interval for the data given there using a confidence level of 95%.
113. Let \(R_{1}\) be a rejection region with significance level \(\alpha\) for testing \(H_{01}\): \(\theta\in\Omega_{1}\) versus \(H_{\text{a1}}\): \(\theta\notin\Omega_{1}\), and let \(R_{2}\) be a level \(\alpha\) rejection region for testing \(H_{02}\): \(\theta\in\Omega_{2}\) versus \(H_{\text{a2}}\): \(\theta\notin\Omega_{2}\), where \(\Omega_{1}\) and \(\Omega_{2}\) are two disjoint sets of possible values of \(\theta\). Now consider testing \(H_{0}\): \(\theta\in\Omega_{1}\cup\Omega_{2}\) versus the alternative \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\theta\notin\Omega_{1}\cup\Omega_{2}\). The proposed rejection region for this latter test is \(R_{1}\cap R_{2}\). That is, \(H_{0}\) is rejected only if both \(H_{01}\) and \(H_{02}\) can be rejected. This procedure is called a _union-intersection test_ (UIT). 1. Show that the UIT is a level \(\alpha\) test. 2. As an example, let \(\mu_{T}\) denote the mean value of a particular variable for a generic (test) drug, and \(\mu_{R}\) denote the mean value of this variable for a brand-name (reference) drug. In _bioequivalence_ testing, the relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{T}/\mu_{R}\leq\delta_{L}\) or \(\mu_{T}/\mu_{R}\geq\delta_{U}\) (not bioequivalent) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\delta_{L}<\mu_{T}/\mu_{R}<\delta_{U}\) (bioequivalent). The limits \(\delta_{L}\) and \(\delta_{U}\) are standards set by regulatory agencies; for certain purposes the FDA uses.80 and 1.25 = 1/.8, respectively. By taking logarithms and letting \(\eta=\ln(\mu)\), \(\tau=\ln(\delta)\), the hypotheses become \(H_{0}\): either \(\eta_{T}-\eta_{R}\leq\tau_{L}\) or \(\geq\tau_{U}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\tau_{L}<\eta_{T}-\eta_{R}<\tau_{U}\). With this setup, a type I error involves saying the drugs are bioequivalent when they are not. The FDA mandates \(\alpha=.05\). Let \(D\) be an estimator of \(\eta_{T}-\eta_{R}\) with standard error \(S_{D}\) such that standardized variable \(T=[D-(\eta_{T}-\eta_{R})]/S_{D}\) has a \(t\) distribution with \(v\) df. The standard test procedure is referred to as \(TOST\) for "two one-sided tests," and is based on the two test statistics \(T_{U}=(D-\tau_{U})/S_{D}\) and \(T_{L}=(D-\tau_{L})/S_{D}\). If \(v=20\), state the appropriate conclusion in each of the following cases: (1) \(\tau_{L}=2.0\), \(\tau_{U}=-1.5\); (2) \(\tau_{L}=1.5\), \(\tau_{U}=-2.0\); (3) \(\tau_{L}=2.0\), \(\tau_{U}=-2.0\).

## Chapter 1 Introduction

In studying methods for the analy's of quantitative data, we first focused on problems involving a single sample of numbers and then turned to a comparative analysis of two different samples. Now we are ready for the analysis of several samples.

The **analysis of variance**, or more briefly ANOVA, refers broadly to a collection of statistical procedures for the analysis of quantitative responses. The simplest ANOVA problem is referred to variously as a **single-factor**, **single-classification**, or one-way ANOVA and involves the analysis of data sampled from two or more numerical populations (distributions). The characteristic that labels the populations is called the **factor** under study, and the populations are referred to as the **levels** of the factor. Examples of such situations include the following:

1. An experiment to study the effects of five different brands of gasoline on automobile engine operating efficiency (mpg)
2. An experiment to study the effects of four different sugar solutions (glucose, sucrose, fructose, and a mixture of the three) on bacterial growth
3. An experiment to investigate whether hardwood concentration in pulp (%) has an effect on tensile strength of bags made from the pulp
4. An experiment to decide whether the color density of fabric specimens depends on the amount of dye usedIn (1) the factor of interest is gasoline brand, and there are five different levels of the factor. In (2) the factor is sugar, with four levels (or five, if a control solution containing no sugar is used). In both (1) and (2), the factor is qualitative in nature, and the levels correspond to possible categories of the factor. In (3) and (4), the factors are concentration of hardwood and amount of dye, respectively; both these factors are quantitative in nature, so the levels identify different settings of the factor. When the factor of interest is quantitative, statistical techniques from regression analysis (discussed in Chapter 12) can also be used to analyze the data.

In this chapter we first introduce single-factor ANOVA. Section 11.1 presents the \(F\) test for testing the null hypothesis that the population means are identical. Section 11.2 considers further analysis of the data when \(H\)0 has been rejected. Section 11.3 covers some other aspects of single-factor ANOVA. Many experimental situations involve studying the simultaneous impact of more than one factor. Various aspects of two-factor ANOVA are considered in the last two sections of the chapter.

## 11 Single-Factor ANOVA

Single-factor ANOVA focuses on a comparison of two or more populations. Let

\[\begin{array}{l}I=\text{the number of treatments being compared}\\ \mu_{1}=\text{the mean of population 1 (or the true average response when}\\ \text{treatment 1 is applied)}\\ \vdots\\ \mu_{I}=\text{the mean of population }I\text{ (or the true average response when}\\ \text{treatment }I\text{ is applied)}\end{array}\]

Then the hypotheses of interest are

\[H_{0}:\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\cdot\cdot\cdot=\mu_{I}\]

versus

\[H_{\text{a}}\text{: at least two of the }\mu_{i}\text{'s are different}\]

If \(I=4,H_{0}\) is true only if all four \(\mu_{i}\)'s are identical. _H_a would be true, for example, if \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\neq\mu_{3}=\mu_{4}\), if \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{3}=\mu_{4}\neq\mu_{2}\), or if all four \(\mu_{i}\)'s differ from each other.

A test of these hypotheses requires that we have available a random sample from each population or treatment.

The article "Compression of Single-Wall Corrugated Shipping Containers Using Fixed and Floating Test Platens" (_J. Test. Eval._, 1992: 318-320) describes an experiment in which several different types of boxes were compared with respect to compression strength (lb). Table 11.1 presents the results of a single-factor ANOVA experiment involving \(I=4\) types of boxes (the sample means and standard deviations are in good agreement with values given in the article).

With \(\mu_{i}\) denoting the true average compression strength for boxes of type \(i\) (\(i=1,2\), 3, 4), the null hypothesis is \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{3}=\mu_{4}\). Figure 11.1(a) shows a comparative boxplot for the four samples. There is a substantial amount of overlap among observations on the first three types of boxes, but compression strengths for the fourth type appear considerably smaller than for the other types. This suggests that \(H_{0}\) is not true. The comparative boxplot in Figure 11.1(b) is based on adding 120

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Type of box** & **Compression strength** & **(lb)** & **Sample mean** & **Sample SD** \\ \hline
1 & 655.5 & 788.3 & 734.3 & 713.00 & 46.55 \\  & 721.4 & 679.1 & 699.4 & & \\

4 & 535.1 & 628.7 & 542.4 & 562.02 & 39.87 \\  & 559.0 & 586.9 & 520.0 & & \\  & & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Grand mean =} & 682.50 & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

to each observation in the fourth sample (giving mean 682.02 and the same standard deviation) and leaving the other observations unaltered. It is no longer obvious whether \(H_{0}\) is true or false. In situations such as this, we need a formal test procedure. 

### Notation and Assumptions

In two-sample problems, we used the letters \(X\) and \(Y\) to designate the observations in the two samples. Because this is cumbersome for three or more samples, it is customary to use a single letter with two subscripts. The first subscript identifies the sample number, corresponding to the population or treatment being sampled, and the second subscript denotes the position of the observation within that sample. Let

\(X_{ij}=\) the random variable (rv) denoting the _j_th measurement from the _i_th population

\(x_{ij}=\) the observed value of \(X_{ij}\) when the experiment is performed

The observed data is usually displayed in a rectangular table, such as Table 11.1. There samples from the different populations appear in different rows of the table, and \(x_{i,j}\) is the _j_th number in the _i_th row. For example, \(x_{2,3}=786.9\) (the third observation from the second population), and \(x_{4,1}=535.1\). When there is no ambiguity, we will write \(x_{ij}\) rather than \(x_{i,j}\) (e.g., if there were 15 observations on each of 12 treatments, \(x_{112}\) could mean \(x_{1,12}\) or \(x_{11,2}\)). It is assumed that the \(X_{ij}\)'s within any particular sample are independent--a random sample from the _i_th population or treatment distribution-- and that different samples are independent of each other.

In some experiments, different samples contain different numbers of observations. However, the concepts and methods of single-factor ANOVA are most easily developed for the case of equal sample sizes. Unequal sample sizes will be considered in Section 11.3. Restricting ourselves for the moment to equal sample sizes, let \(J\) denote the number of observations in each sample (\(J=6\) in Example 11.1). The data set consists of \(IJ\) observations. The individual sample means will be denoted by \(\overline{X}_{1.},\ \overline{X}_{2.},\ \ldots,\overline{X}_{I.}\). That is,

\[\overline{X}_{i.}=\frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J}X_{ij}}{J}\quad i=1,2,\ldots,I\]

The dot in place of the second subscript signifies that we have added over all values of that subscript while holding the other subscript value fixed, and the horizontal bar indicates division by \(J\) to obtain an average. Similarly, the average of all \(IJ\) observations, called the **grand mean**, is

\[\overline{X}_{..}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{I}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J}X_{ij}}{IJ}\]

For the strength data in Table 11.1, \(\bar{x}_{1.}=713.00\), \(\bar{x}_{2.}=756.93\), \(\bar{x}_{3.}=698.07\), \(\bar{x}_{4}=562.02\), and \(\bar{x}_{..}=682.50\). Additionally, let \(S_{1}^{2},S_{2}^{2},\ldots,S_{I}^{2}\) represent the sample variances:\[S_{i}^{2} = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J}{(X_{ij}-\bar{X}_{i\cdot})}^{2}}{J-1}\qquad i =1,2,\ldots,I\] From Example 11.1, \(s_{1}=46.55\), \(s_{1}^{2}=2166.90\), and so on.

The \(I\) population or treatment distributions are all normal with the same variance \(\sigma^{2}\). That is, each \(X_{ij}\) is normally distributed with

\[E(X_{ij})=\mu_{i}\qquad V(X_{ij})=\sigma^{2}\]

In previous chapters, a normal probability plot was suggested for checking normality. The individual sample sizes in ANOVA are typically too small for \(I\) separate plots to be informative. A single plot can be constructed by subtracting \(\bar{x}_{1}\) from each observation in the first sample, \(\bar{x}_{2}\). from each observation in the second, and so on, and then plotting these \(IJ\) deviations against the \(z\) percentiles. The deviations are called **residuals** so this plot is the normal plot of the residuals. Figure 11.2 gives the plot for the residuals of Example 11.1. The straightness of the pattern gives strong support to the normality assumption.

At the end of the section we discuss Levene's test for the equal variance assumption. For the moment, a rough rule of thumb is that if the largest \(s\) is not much more than twice the smallest \(s\), it is reasonable to assume equal variances. This is especially true if the sample sizes are equal or close to equal. In Example 11.1, the largest \(s\) is only about 1.25 times the smallest.

## Sums of Squares and Mean Squares

If \(H_{0}\) is true the \(J\) observations in each sample come from a normal population distribution with the _same_ mean value \(\mu\), in which case the sample means \(\bar{x}_{1},\bar{x}_{2},\ldots\bar{x}_{I}\), should be reasonably close. The test procedure is based on comparing

Figure 11.2: A normal probability plot based on the data of Example 11.1

a measure of differences among these sample means ("between-samples" variation) to a measure of variation calculated from _within_ each sample. These measures involve quantities called _sums of squares_.

**Definition**: The **treatment sum of squares SSTr** is given by

\[\text{SSTr}=J\sum_{i}\left(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot} \right)^{2}=J[(\overline{X}_{1\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot})^{2}+\cdots+( \overline{X}_{I\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot})^{2}]\]

and the **error sum of squares SSE** is

\[\text{SSE}= \sum_{i}\sum_{j}\left(X_{ij}-\overline{X}_{i\cdot}\right)^{2}\] \[= \sum_{j}\left(X_{1j}-\overline{X}_{1\cdot}\right)^{2}+\cdots+\sum _{j}\left(X_{lj}-\overline{X}_{I\cdot}\right)^{2}\] \[= (J-1)S_{1}^{2}+(J-1)S_{2}^{2}+\cdots+(J-1)S_{I}^{2}\] \[= (J-1)[S_{1}^{2}+S_{2}^{2}+\cdots+S_{I}^{2}]\]

Now recall a result from Section 6.4 : if \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\) is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), then the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) and the sample variance \(S^{2}\) are independent. Also, \(\overline{X}\) is normally distributed, and \((n-1)S^{2}/\sigma^{2}\) [i.e., \(\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)^{2}/\sigma^{2}\)] has a chi-squared distribution with \(n\,-\,1\) df. That is, dividing the sum of squares \(\sum\left(X_{i}-\overline{X}\right)^{2}\) by \(\sigma^{2}\) gives a chi-squared random variable. Similar results hold in our ANOVA situation.

**Theorem**: When the basic assumptions of this section are satisfied, \(\text{SSE}/\sigma^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(I(J-1)\) df (each sample contributes \(J-1\) df and df's add because the samples are independent). Furthermore, when \(H_{0}\) is true, \(\text{SSTr}/\sigma^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(I-1\) df [there are \(I\) deviations \(\overline{X}_{1\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot},\ldots,\overline{X}_{I\cdot} -\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}\) but \(1\) df is lost because \(\sum_{i}\left(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)=0\)]. Lastly, SSE and SSTr are independent random variables.

If we let \(Y_{i}=\overline{X}_{i\cdot},\quad i=1,\ldots,I\), then \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{I}\) are independent and normally distributed with the same mean under \(H_{0}\) and with variance \(\sigma^{2}/J\). Thus, by the key result from Section 6.4, \((I-1)S_{Y}^{2}/(\sigma^{2}/J)\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(I-1\) df. Furthermore, \((I-1)S_{Y}^{2}/(\sigma^{2}/J)=J\sum\left(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{ \cdot\cdot}\right)^{2}/\sigma^{2}=\text{SSTr}/\sigma^{2}\), so \(\text{SSTr}/\sigma^{2}\sim\chi_{I-1}^{2}\). Independence of SSTr and SSE follows from the fact that SSTr is based on the individual sample means whereas SSE is based on the sample variances, and \(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}\) is independent of \(S_{i}^{2}\) for each \(i\).

The expected value of a chi-squared variable with \(\nu\) df is just \(\nu\). Thus

\[E\left(\frac{SSE}{\sigma^{2}}\right)=I(J-1)\Rightarrow E\left(\frac{SSE}{I(J- 1)}\right)=\sigma^{2}\]\[H_{0}\ \ \text{true}\ \ \Rightarrow\ E\left(\frac{SSTr}{\sigma^{2}}\right)=I-1 \Rightarrow E\left(\frac{SSTr}{I-1}\right)=\sigma^{2}\]

Whenever the ratio of a sum of squares over \(\sigma^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution, we divide the sum of squares by its degrees of freedom to obtain a _mean square_ ("mean" is used in the sense of "average").

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline DEFINITION & The **mean square for treatments** is \(\text{MSTR}=\text{SSTr}/(I-1)\) and the **mean square for error** is \(\text{MSE}=\text{SSE}/[I(J-1)]\). \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Notice that upper case \(X\)'s and \(S\)'s are used in defining the sums of squares and thus the mean squares, so the SS's and MS's are statistics (random variables). We will follow tradition and also use MSTr and MSE (rather than mstr and mse) to denote the calculated values of these statistics.

The foregoing results concerning expected values can now be restated:

\[E(\text{MSE})=\sigma^{2}\text{; that is, MSE is an unbiased estimator of }\sigma^{2}\]

\[H_{0}\ \ \text{true}\ \ \Rightarrow E(\text{MSTr})=\sigma^{2}\text{; so MSTr is an unbiased estimator of }\sigma^{2}\]

MSTr is unbiased for \(\sigma^{2}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true, but what about when \(H_{0}\) is false? It can be shown (Exercise 10) that in this case, \(E(\text{MSTr})>\sigma^{2}\). This is because the \(\overline{X}_{i}\).'s tend to differ more from each other, and therefore from the grand mean, when the \(\mu_{i}\)'s are not identical than when they are the same.

### The \(F\) Test

The test statistic is the ratio \(F=\text{MSTr}/\text{MSE}\). \(F\) is a ratio of two estimators of \(\sigma^{2}\). The numerator (the between-samples estimator), MSTr, is unbiased when \(H_{0}\) is true but tends to overestimate \(\sigma^{2}\) when \(H_{0}\) is false, whereas the denominator (the within-samples estimator), MSE, is unbiased regardless of the status of \(H_{0}\). Thus if \(H_{0}\) is true the \(F\) ratio should be reasonably close to 1, but if the \(\mu_{i}\)'s differ considerably from each other, \(F\) should greatly exceed 1. Thus a value of \(F\) considerably exceeding 1 argues for rejection of \(H_{0}\).

In Section 6.4 we introduced a family of probability distributions called \(F\) distributions. If \(Y_{1}\) and \(Y_{2}\) are two independent chi-squared random variables with \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) df, respectively, then the ratio \(F=(Y_{1}/v_{1})/(Y_{2}/v_{2})\) has an \(F\) distribution with \(v_{1}\) numerator df and \(v_{2}\) denominator df. Figure 13 shows an \(F\) density curve and corresponding upper-tail critical value \(F_{x,v_{1},v_{2}}\). Appendix Table A.8 gives these critical values for \(\alpha=.10,.05,.01,\) and \(.001\). Values of \(v_{1}\) are identified with different columns of the table and the rows are labeled with various values of \(v_{2}\). For example, the \(F\) critical value that captures upper-tail area.05 under the \(F\) curve with \(v_{1}=4\) and \(v_{2}=6\) is \(F_{.05,A,6}=4.53\), whereas \(F_{.05,6,4}=6.16\) (so don't accidentally switch numerator and denominator df!). The key theoretical result that justifies the test procedure is that the test statistic \(F\) has an \(F\) distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true.

Refer to Section 10.5 to see how _P_-value information for \(F\) tests can be obtained from the table of \(F\) critical values. Alternatively, statistical software packages will automatically include the _P_-value with ANOVA output.

### Computational Formulas

The calculations leading to \(f\) can be done efficiently by using formulas similar to the computing formula for the numerator of the sample variance \(s\)2 from Section 1.4. The first two computational formulas here are essentially repetitions of that formula with new notation. Let _xi_. represent the _sum_ (not the average, since there is no overbar) of the _xij_'s for fixed \(i\) (the total of the \(J\) observations in the _i_th sample). Similarly, let \(x\). denote the sum of all _IJ_ observations (the **grand total**). We also need a third sum of squares in addition to SSTr and SSE.

\[\begin{array}{lclclcl} \text{Sum of Squares}&&\text{df}&&\text{Definition}&&\text{Computing Formula}\\ \text{Total}=\text{SST}&&IJ-1&&\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j}\left(x_{ij}-\pi_{.}\right)^{2}&&\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j}x_{ij}^{2}-x_{j}^{2}/IJ\\ \text{Treatment}=\text{SSTr}&&I-1&&\sum\limits_{i}\sum\limits_{j}\left(\bar{x}_{i}-\bar{x}_{.}\right)^{2}&&\sum\limits_{i}^{2}\frac{x_{i}^{2}}{J}-\frac{x_{i}^{2}}{IJ}\\ &&&&&=J\sum\limits_{i}\left(\bar{x}_{i}-\bar{x}_{.}\right)^{2}&&\text{SST}-\text{SSTr}\end{array}\]Both SST and SSTr involve \(x_{\cdot}^{2}/IJ\), which is called either the _correction factor_ or the _correction for the mean_. SST results from squaring each observation, adding these squares, and then subtracting the correction factor. Calculation of SSTr entails squaring each sample total (each row total from the data table), summing these squares, dividing the sum by \(J\), and again subtracting the correction factor. SSTr is subtracted from SST to give SSE (it must be the case that SST \(\geq\) SSTr), after which MSTr, MSE, and finally \(f\) are calculated.

The computational formula for SSE is a consequence of the **fundamental ANOVA identity**

\[{\rm SST}\ ={\rm SSTr}+{\rm SSE}\]

The identity implies that once any two of the SS's have been calculated, the remaining one is easily obtained by addition or subtraction. The two that are most easily calculated are SST and SSTr. The proof of the identity follows from squaring both sides of the relationship

\[x_{ij}-\bar{x}_{\cdot\cdot}=\left(x_{ij}-\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\right)+\left(\bar{x} _{i\cdot}-\bar{x}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)\]

and summing over all \(i\) and \(j\). This gives SST on the left and SSTr and SSE as the two extreme terms on the right; the cross-product term is easily seen to be zero (Exercise 9).

The interpretation of the fundamental identity is an important aid to understanding ANOVA. SST is a measure of total variation in the data - the sum of all squared deviations about the grand mean. The identity says that this total variation can be partitioned into two pieces; it is this decomposition of SST that gives rise to the name "analysis of variance" (more appropriately, "analysis of variation"). SSE measures variation that would be present (within samples) even if \(H_{0}\) were true and is thus the part of total variation that is _unexplained_ by the status of \(H_{0}\) (true or false). SSTr is the part of total variation (between samples) that _can be_ explained by possible differences in the \(\mu_{i}\)'s. If explained variation is large relative to unexplained variation, then \(H_{0}\) is rejected in favor of \(H_{\rm a}\).

Once SSTr and SSE are computed, each is divided by its associated df to obtain a mean square (mean in the sense of average). Then \(F\) is the ratio of the two mean squares.

\[{\rm MSTr}=\frac{{\rm SSTr}}{I-1}\qquad{\rm MSE}=\frac{{\rm SSE}}{I(J-1)}\qquad F =\frac{{\rm MSTr}}{{\rm MSE}}\]

The computations are often summarized in a tabular format, called an **ANOVA table,** as displayed in Table 1.2. Tables produced by statistical software customarily include a \(P\)-value column to the right of \(f\).

The accompanying data resulted from an experiment comparing the degree of soiling for fabric copolymerized with three different mixtures of methacrylic acid (similar data appeared in the article "Chemical Factors Affecting Soiling and Soil Release from Cotton DP Fabric," _Am. Dyest. Rep._, 1983: 25-30).

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Mixture** & **Degree of Soiling** & & & \(x_{i}\) & \(\bar{x}_{i}\) \\ \hline
1 &.56 & 1.12 &.90 & 1.07 &.94 & 4.59 &.918 \\
2 &.72 &.69 &.87 &.78 &.91 & 3.97 &.794 \\
3 &.62 & 1.08 & 1.07 &.99 &.93 & 4.69 &.938 \\  & & & & & & \(x_{\cdot = 13.25}\) & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Let \(\mu_{i}\) denote the true average degree of soiling when mixture \(i\) is used (\(i=1,2,3\)). The null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{3}\) states that the true average degree of soiling is identical for the three mixtures. We will carry out a test at significance level.01 to see whether \(H_{0}\) should be rejected in favor of the assertion that true average degree of soiling is not the same for all mixtures. Since \(I-1=2\) and \(I(J-1)=12\), the \(F\) critical value for the rejection region is \(F_{.01,2,12}=6.93\). Squaring each of the 15 observations and summing gives \(\sum\sum x_{ij}^{2}=(.56)^{2}+(1.12)^{2}+\cdots+(.93)^{2}=12.1351\). The values of the three sums of squares are

SST \[= 12.1351-13.25^{2}/15=12.1351-11.7042=.4309\] SSTr \[= \frac{1}{5}[4.59^{2}+3.97^{2}+4.69^{2}]-11.7042\] \[= 11.7650-11.7042=.0608\] SSE \[=.4309-.0608=.3701\] The remaining computations are summarized in the accompanying ANOVA table. Because \(f=.99\) is not at least \(F_{.01,2,12}=6.93\), \(H_{0}\) is not rejected at significance level.01. The mixtures appear to be indistinguishable with respect to degree of soiling (\(F_{.10,2,12}=2.81\Rightarrow P-\text{value}{>}.10\)).

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline
**Source of Variation** & **df** & **Sum of Squares** & **Mean Square** & \(f\) \\ \hline Treatments & 2 &.0608 &.0304 &.99 \\ Error & 12 &.3701 &.0308 & \\ Total & 14 &.4309 & & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

When the F test causes \(H_{0}\) to be rejected, the experimenter will often be interested in further analysis to decide which \(\mu_{i}\)'s differ from which others. Procedures for doing this are called multiple comparison procedures, and several are described in the next two sections.

\begin{table}

When \(H_{0}\) is false, how does \(E(\text{MSTr})\) compare to \(\sigma^{2}\)? 11. 2. **Multiple Comparisons in ANOVA** When the computed value of the \(F\) statistic in single-factor ANOVA is not significant, the analysis is terminated because no differences among the \(\mu_{i}\)'s have been identified. But when \(H_{0}\) is rejected, the investigator will usually want to know which of the \(\mu_{i}\)'s are different from each other. A method for carrying out this further analysis is called a **multiple comparisons procedure**.

Several of the most frequently used such procedures are based on the following central idea. First calculate a confidence interval for each pairwise difference \(\mu_{i}-\mu_{j}\) with \(i<j\). Thus if \(I=4\), the six required CIs would be for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) (but not also for \(\mu_{2}-\mu_{1}\)), \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{3}\), \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{4}\), \(\mu_{2}-\mu_{3}\), \(\mu_{2}-\mu_{4}\), and \(\mu_{3}-\mu_{4}\). Then if the interval for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) does not include 0, conclude that \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\)_differ significantly_ from each other; if the interval does include 0, the two \(\mu\)'s are judged not significantly different. Following the same line of reasoning for each of the other intervals, we end up being able to judge for each pair of \(\mu\)'s whether or not they differ significantly from each other.

The procedures based on this idea differ in the method used to calculate the various CIs. Here we present a popular method that controls the _simultaneous_ confidence level for all \(I(I-1)/2\) intervals calculated.

### Tukey's Procedure

Tukey's procedure involves the use of another probability distribution.

\begin{tabular}{l l} DEFINITION & Let \(Z_{1}\), \(Z_{2}\),\(\ldots\), \(Z_{m}\) be \(m\) independent standard normal rv's and \(W\) be a chi-squared rv, independent of the \(Z_{i}\)'s, with \(v\) df. Then the distribution of \\  & \(Q=\frac{\max|Z_{i}-Z_{j}|}{\sqrt{W/v}}=\frac{\max(Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{m})-\min(Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{m})}{\sqrt{W/v}}\) \\  & is called the **studentized range distribution**. The distribution has two parameters, \(m=\) the number of \(Z_{i}\)'s and \(v=\) denominator df. We denote the critical value that captures upper-tail area \(\alpha\) under the density curve of \(Q\) by \(Q_{\alpha,m,v}\). A tabulation of these critical values appears in Appendix Table 9. \\ \end{tabular}

The word "range" reflects the fact that the numerator of \(Q\) is indeed the range of the \(Z_{i}\)'s. Dividing the range by\(\sqrt{W/v}\) is the same as dividing each individual \(Z_{i}\) by \(\sqrt{W/v}\). But \(Z_{i}/\sqrt{W/v}\) has a (Student) \(t\) distribution (Student was the pseudonym used by the statistician Gossett, who derived the \(t\) distribution but published his work using the pseudonym "Student" because his employer, the Guinness Brewing Co., would not permit publication under his own name.); "studentizing" refers to the division by \(\sqrt{W/v}\). So \(Q\) is actually the range of \(m\) variables that have the \(t\) distribution (but they are not independent because the denominator is the same for each one).

The identification of the quantities in the definition with single-factor ANOVA is as follows:

\[Z_{i}=\frac{\overline{X}_{i}-\mu_{i}}{\sigma/\sqrt{J}}\quad m=I\quad W=\frac{ \text{SSE}}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{I(J-1)\text{MSE}}{\sigma^{2}}\quad v=I(J-1)\]Substituting into \(Q\) gives

\[Q=\frac{\max\left|\frac{\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\mu_{i}}{\sigma/\sqrt{J}}-\frac{ \overline{X}_{j\cdot}-\mu_{i}}{\sigma/\sqrt{J}}\right|}{\sqrt{\frac{I(J-1) \mathrm{MSE}}{\sigma^{2}}}/[I(J-1)]}=\frac{\max\left|\overline{X}_{i\cdot}- \overline{X}_{j\cdot}-(\mu_{i}-\mu_{j})\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}}\]

In this latter expression for \(Q\), the denominator \(\sqrt{MSE/J}\) is the estimated standard deviation of \(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\mu_{i}\). By definition of \(Q\) and \(Q_{x}\), \(P(Q>Q_{x})=\alpha\), so

\[1-\alpha =P\left(\frac{\max\left|\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j \cdot}-(\mu_{i}-\mu_{j})\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}}\leq Q_{\alpha JJ(J-1)}\right)\] \[=P\left(\frac{\left|\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j\cdot}-( \mu_{i}-\mu_{j})\right|}{\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}}\leq Q_{\alpha JJ(J-1)}\text{ for all }i,j\right)\] \[=P\left(-Q_{x}\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}\leq\overline{X}_{i\cdot}- \overline{X}_{j\cdot}-(\mu_{i}-\mu_{j})\leq Q_{x}\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}\text{ for all }i,j\right)\] \[=P\left(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j\cdot}-Q_{x}\sqrt{ \mathrm{MSE}/J}\leq\mu_{i}-\mu_{j}\leq\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j \cdot}+Q_{x}\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}\text{ for all }i,j\right)\] (when!). Replacing \(\overline{X}_{i\cdot},\ \overline{X}_{j\cdot}\), and MSE by the values calculated from the data gives the following result.

**PROPOSITION**: For each \(i<j\), form the interval

\[\overline{x}_{i\cdot}-\overline{x}_{j\cdot}\pm Q_{\alpha JJ(J-1)}\sqrt{MSE/J} \tag{11.4}\]

There are \(\binom{I}{2}=I(I-1)/2\) such intervals: one for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\), another for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{3}\), \(\ldots\), and the last for \(\mu_{I-1}-\mu_{I}\). Then the _simultaneous_ confidence level that _every_ interval includes the corresponding value of \(\mu_{i}-\mu_{j}\) is \(100(1-\alpha)\%\). Notice that the second subscript on \(Q_{x}\) is \(I\), whereas the second subscript on \(F_{x}\) used in the \(F\) test is \(I{-}1\).

We will say more about the interpretation of "simultaneous" shortly. Each interval that doesn't include 0 yields the conclusion that the corresponding values of \(\mu_{i}\) and \(\mu_{j}\) are different--we say that \(\mu_{i}\) and \(\mu_{j}\) "differ significantly" from each other. For purposes of deciding which \(\mu_{i}\)'s differ significantly from which others (i.e., identifying the intervals that don't include 0) much of the arithmetic associated with calculating the CI's can be avoided. The following box gives details and describes how differences can be displayed using an "underscoring pattern".

**TUREY'S**: Select \(\alpha\), extract \(Q_{\alpha JJ(J-1)}\) from Appendix Table A.9, and calculate \(w=Q_{\alpha JJ(J-1)}\cdot\sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}/J}\). Then list the sample means in increasing order and underline those pairs that differ by less than \(w\). Any pair of sample means not underscored by the same line corresponds to a pair of population or treatment means that are judged significantly different. The quantity \(w\) is sometimes referred to as Tukey's honestly significantly difference (HSD).

Suppose, for example, that \(I=5\) and that \[\bar{x}_{2}.<\bar{x}_{5}.<\bar{x}_{4}.<\bar{x}_{1}.<\bar{x}_{3}.\] Then **1.**: Consider first the smallest mean \(\bar{x}_{2}.\) If \(\bar{x}_{5}.-\bar{x}_{2}.\geq w\), proceed to step 2. However, if \(\bar{x}_{5}.-\bar{x}_{2}.<\)\(w\), connect these first two means with a line segment. Then if possible extend this line segment even further to the right to the largest \(\bar{x}_{i}.\) that differs from \(\bar{x}_{2}.\) by less than \(w\) (so the line may connect two, three, or even more means). **2.**: Now move to \(\bar{x}_{5}.\), and again extend a line segment to the largest \(\bar{x}_{i}.\) to its right that differs from \(\bar{x}_{5}.\) by less than \(w\) (it may not be possible to draw this line, or alternatively it may underscore just two means, or three, or even all four remaining means). **3.**: Continue by moving to \(\bar{x}_{4}.\) and repeating, and then finally move to \(\bar{x}_{1}.\). To summarize, starting from each mean in the ordered list, a line segment is extended as far to the right as possible as long as the difference between the means is smaller than \(w.\) It is easily verified that a particular interval of the form (11.4) will contain 0 if and only if the corresponding pair of sample means is underscored by the same line segment. **Example 11.4**: An experiment was carried out to compare five different brands of automobile oil filters with respect to their ability to capture foreign material. Let \(\mu_{i}\) denote the true average amount of material captured by brand \(i\) filters (\(i=1,\ \ldots\), 5) under controlled conditions. A sample of nine filters of each brand was used, resulting in the following sample mean amounts: \(\bar{x}_{1}.=14.5,\ \bar{x}_{2}.=13.8,\ \bar{x}_{3}.=13.3,\)\(\bar{x}_{4}.=14.3,\) and \(\bar{x}_{5}.=13.1.\) Table 13 is the ANOVA table summarizing the first part of the analysis. **Table 11.3** ANOVA table for Example 11.4

Since \(F_{05,4,40}=2.61,H_{0}\) is rejected (decisively) at level.05. We now use Tukey's procedure to look for significant differences among the \(\mu_{i}\)'s. From Appendix Table A.9, \(Q_{05,5,40}=4.04\) (the second subscript on \(Q\) is \(I\) and not \(I-1\) as in \(F\)), so \(w=4.04\sqrt{.088/9}=.4.\) After we arrange the five sample means in increasing order, the two smallest can be connected by a line segment because they differ by less than.4. However, this segment cannot be extended further to the right since \(13.8-13.1=.7\geq.4\). Moving one mean to the right, the pair \(\bar{x}_{3}.\) and \(\bar{x}_{2}.\) cannot be underscored because these means differ by more than.4. Again moving to the right, the next mean, 13.8, cannot be connected to any further to the right, and finally the last two means can be underscored with the same line segment.

There are \(I=4\) treatments and 16 df for error, so \(Q_{0.05,4,16}=4.05\) and \(w=4.05\sqrt{93.0/5}=17.47\). Ordering the means and underscoring yields

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\bar{x}_{4}&\bar{x}_{3}.&\bar{x}_{2}.&\bar{x}_{1}.\\ 32.76&47.92&61.54&79.28\end{array}\]

The interpretation of this underscoring must be done with care, since we seem to have concluded that treatments 2 and 3 do not differ, 3 and 4 do not differ, yet 2 and 4 do differ. The suggested way of expressing this is to say that although evidence allows us to conclude that treatments 2 and 4 differ from each other, neither has been shown to be significantly different from 3. Treatment 1 has a significantly higher true average REM sleep time than any of the other treatments. This treatment involves 0 ethanol (alcohol) and there is a trend toward less sleep with more ethanol, although not all differences are significant.

Figure 11.4 shows SAS output from the application of Tukey's procedure.

## The Interpretation of \(\alpha\) in Tukey's Procedure

We stated previously that the _simultaneous_ confidence level is controlled by Tukey's method. So what does "simultaneous" mean here? Consider calculating a 95% CI for a population mean \(\mu\) based on a sample from that population and then

Figure 11.4: Tukey’s method using SAS

a 95% CI for a population proportion \(p\) based on another sample selected independently of the first one. Prior to obtaining data, the probability that the first interval will include \(m\) is.95, and this is also the probability that the second interval will include \(p\). Because the two samples are selected independently of each other, the probability that _both_ intervals will include the values of the respective parameters is (.95)(.95) = (.95)2 .90. Thus the _simultaneous_ or _joint_ confidence level for the two intervals is roughly 90%--if pairs of intervals are calculated over and over again from independent samples, in the long run roughly 90% of the time the first interval will capture \(m\) and the second will include \(p\). Similarly, if three CIs are calculated based on independent samples, the simultaneous confidence level will be 100(.95)3%  86%. Clearly, as the number of intervals increases, the simultaneous confidence level that all intervals capture their respective parameters will decrease.

Now suppose that we want to maintain the simultaneous confidence level at 95%. Then for two independent samples, the individual confidence level for each would have to be 100\(\sqrt{.95}\%\approx\) 97.5%. The larger the number of intervals, the higher the individual confidence level would have to be to maintain the 95% simultaneous level.

The tricky thing about the Tukey intervals is that they are not based on independent samples--MSE appears in every one, and various intervals share the same \(\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\)'s (e.g., in the case \(I=4\), three different intervals all use \(\bar{x}_{1\cdot}\)). This implies that there is no straightforward probability argument for ascertaining the simultaneous confidence level from the individual confidence levels. Nevertheless, if \(Q_{.05}\) is used, the simultaneous confidence level is controlled at 95%, whereas using \(Q_{.01}\) gives a simultaneous 99% level. To obtain a 95% simultaneous level, the individual level for each interval must be considerably larger than 95%. Said in a slightly different way, to obtain a 5% _experimentwise_ or _family_ error rate, the individual or per-comparison error rate for each interval must be considerably smaller than.05. MINITAB asks the user to specify the family error rate (e.g., 5%) and then includes on output the individual error rate (see Exercise 16).

### Confidence Intervals for Other Parametric Functions

In some situations, a CI is desired for a function of the _m__i_'s more complicated than a difference _m__i_-_m__j_. Let \(\theta=\sum c_{i}\mu_{i}\), where the _c__i_'s are constants. One such function is \(\frac{1}{2}(\mu_{1}+\mu_{2})-\frac{1}{3}(\mu_{3}+\mu_{4}+\mu_{5})\), which in the context of Example 11.4 measures the difference between the group consisting of the first two brands and that of the last three brands. Because the _X__ij_'s are normally distributed with _E_(\(X_{j}\)) = \(m_{i}\) and _V_(\(X_{j}\)) = \(s_{2}\), \(\hat{\theta}=\Sigma_{i}c_{i}\overline{X}_{i\cdot}\) is normally distributed, unbiased for _th_, and

\[V(\hat{\theta})=V(\sum_{i}c_{i}\overline{X}_{i\cdot})=\sum_{i}c_{i}^{2}V( \overline{X}_{i\cdot})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{J}\sum_{i}c_{i}^{2}\]

Estimating \(s\)2 by MSE and forming \(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}\) results in a \(t\) variable \((\hat{\theta}-\theta)/\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\theta}}\), which can be manipulated to obtain the following 100(1 - _a_)% confidence interval for _C__i_m__i_:

\[\sum\nolimits_{i}c_{i}\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\pm t_{a/2J(J-1)}\sqrt{(\text{MSE}\sum c _{i}^{2})/J} \tag{11.5}\]The parametric function for comparing the first two (store) brands of oil filter with the last three (national) brands is \(\theta = \frac{1}{2}(\mu_{1} + \mu_{2}) - \frac{1}{3}(\mu_{3} + \mu_{4} + \mu_{5})\), from which

\[\sum c_{i}^{2} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} + \left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^{2} + \left( - \frac{1}{3} \right)^{2} + \left( - \frac{1}{3} \right)^{2} + \left( - \frac{1}{3} \right)^{2} = \frac{5}{6}\] With \(\hat{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}(\bar{x}_{1}. + \bar{x}_{2}.) - \frac{1}{3}(\bar{x}_{3}. + \bar{x}_{4}. + \bar{x}_{5}.) =.583\) and MSE =.088, a 95% interval is

\[.583 \pm 2.021\sqrt{5(.088)/[(6)(9)]} =.583 \pm.182 = (.401,.765)\]

Notice that in the foregoing example the coefficients \(c_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(c_{5}\) satisfy \(\sum c_{i} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{3} = 0\). When the coefficients sum to 0, the linear combination \(\theta = \sum c_{i}\mu_{i}\) is called a **contrast** among the means, and the analysis is available in a number of statistical software programs.

Sometimes an experiment is carried out to compare each of several "new" treatments to a control treatment. In such situations, a multiple comparisons technique called Dunnett's method is appropriate.

* **Exercise 11.2*
* **An experiment to compare the spreading rates of five different brands of yellow interior latex paint available in a particular area used 4 gallons (_J_ = _4_) of each paint. The sample average spreading rates (ft2/gal) for the five brands were \(\bar{x}_{1}. = 462.0,\qquad\bar{x}_{2}. = 512.8,\qquad\bar{x}_{3}. = 437.5,\)\(\bar{x}_{4} = 469.3,\) and \(\bar{x}_{5}. = 532.1\). The computed value of \(F\) was found to be significant at level \(\alpha =.05\).

## Appendix A More on Single-Factor ANOVA

In this section, we briefly consider some additional issues relating to single-factor ANOVA. These include an alternative description of the model parameters, \(\beta\) for the \(F\) test, the relationship of the test to procedures previously considered, data transformation, a random effects model, and formulas for the case of unequal sample sizes.

## Appendix B An Alternative Description of the ANOVA Model

The assumptions of single-factor ANOVA can be described succinctly by means of the "model equation"

\[X_{ij}=\mu_{i}+\varepsilon_{ij}\]

where \(\varepsilon_{ij}\) represents a random deviation from the population or true treatment mean \(\mu_{i}\). The \(\varepsilon_{ij}\)'s are assumed to be independent, normally distributed rv's (implying that the \(X_{ij}\)'s are also) with \(E(\varepsilon_{ij})=0\) [so that \(E(X_{ij})=\mu_{i}\)] and \(V(\varepsilon_{ij})=\sigma^{2}\) [from which \(V(X_{ij})=\sigma^{2}\) for every \(i\) and \(j\)]. An alternative description of single-factor ANOVA will give added insight and suggest appropriate generalizations to models involving more than one factor. Define a parameter \(\mu\) by \[\mu=\frac{1}{I}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\mu_{i}\]

and the parameters \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\alpha_{I}\) by

\[\alpha_{i}=\mu_{i}-\mu\quad(i=1,\ldots,I)\]

Then the treatment mean \(\mu_{i}\) can be written as \(\mu\) + \(\alpha_{i}\), where \(\mu\) represents the true average overall response in the experiment, and \(\alpha_{i}\) is the effect, measured as a departure from \(\mu\), due to the \(i\)th treatment. Whereas we initially had \(I\) parameters, we now have \(I+1\) (\(\mu\), \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\alpha_{I}\)). However, because \(\sum\alpha_{i}=0\) (the average departure from the overall mean response is zero), only \(I\) of these new parameters are independently determined, so there are as many independent parameters as there were before. In terms of \(\mu\) and the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s, the model becomes

\[X_{ij}=\mu_{i}+\alpha_{i}+\varepsilon_{ij}\qquad(i=1,\ldots,I;\;j=1,\ldots,J)\]

In the next two sections, we will develop analogous models for two-factor ANOVA. The claim that the \(\mu_{i}\)'s are identical is equivalent to the equality of the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s, and because \(\sum\alpha_{i}=0\), the null hypothesis becomes

\[H_{0}:\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=\cdots=\alpha_{I}=0\]

In Section 11.1, it was stated that MSTr is an unbiased estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true but otherwise tends to overestimate \(\sigma^{2}\). More precisely,

\[E(\text{MSTr})=\sigma^{2}+\frac{J}{I-1}\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}\]

When \(H_{0}\) is true, \(\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}=0\) so \(E(\text{MSTr})=\sigma^{2}\) (MSE is unbiased whether or not \(H_{0}\) is true). If \(\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}\) is used as a measure of the extent to which \(H_{0}\) is false, then a larger value of \(\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}\) will result in a greater tendency for MSTr to overestimate \(\sigma^{2}\). More generally, formulas for expected mean squares for multifactor models are used to suggest how to form \(F\) ratios to test various hypotheses.

**Proof of the Formula for \(E(\text{MSTr})\)** For any rv \(Y\), \(E(Y^{2})=V(Y)+[E(Y)]^{2}\), so

\[E(\text{SSTr}) =E\left(\frac{1}{J}\sum_{i}X_{i}^{2}-\frac{1}{IJ}X_{\cdot\cdot}^{ 2}\right)=\frac{1}{J}\sum_{i}E(X_{i\cdot}^{2})-\frac{1}{IJ}E(X_{\cdot\cdot}^{ 2})\] \[=\frac{1}{J}\sum_{i}\left\{V(X_{i\cdot})+[E(X_{i\cdot})]^{2} \right\}-\frac{1}{IJ}\left\{V(X_{\cdot\cdot})+[E(X_{\cdot\cdot})]^{2}\right\}\] \[=\frac{1}{J}\sum_{i}\left\{J\sigma^{2}+[J(\mu+\alpha_{i})]^{2} \right\}-\frac{1}{IJ}\left\{IJ\sigma^{2}+(IJ\mu)^{2}\right\}\] \[=I\sigma^{2}+IJ\mu^{2}+2\mu J\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}+J\sum_{i}\alpha_{ i}^{2}-\sigma^{2}-IJ\mu^{2}\] \[=(I-1)\sigma^{2}+J\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}^{2}\qquad\quad(\text{since }\sum\alpha_{i}=0)\]

The result then follows from the relationship MSTr = SSTr/(\(I-1\)).

### \(b\) for the \(F\) Test

Consider a set of parameter values \(a\)1, \(a\)2,..., \(a_{I}\) for which \(H\)0 is not true. The probability of a type II error, \(b\), is the probability that \(H\)0 is not rejected when that set is the set of true values. One might think that \(b\) would have to be determined separately for each different configuration of _a__i_'s. Fortunately, since \(b\) for the \(F\) test depends on the _a__i_'s and \(s\)2 only through \(\sum \alpha_{i}^{2}/\sigma^{2}\) it can be simultaneously evaluated for many different alternatives. For example, \(\sum \alpha_{i}^{2}=4\) for each of the following sets of _a__i_'s for which \(H\)0 is false, so \(b\) is identical for all three alternatives:

1. \(\alpha_{1}=-1\), \(a\)2 = -1, \(a\)3 = 1, \(a\)4 = 1
2. \(\alpha_{1}=-\sqrt{2}\), \(a\)2 = \(\sqrt{2}\), \(a\)3 = 0, \(a\)4 = 0
3. \(\alpha_{1}=-\sqrt{3}\), \(a\)2 = \(\sqrt{1/3}\), \(a\)3 = \(\sqrt{1/3}\), \(a\)4 = \(\sqrt{1/3}\)

The quantity \(J\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}/\sigma^{2}\) is called the **noncentrality parameter** for one-way ANOVA (because when \(H\)0 is false the test statistic has a _noncentral F_ distribution with this as one of its parameters), and \(b\) is a decreasing function of the value of this parameter. Thus, for fixed values of \(s\)2 and \(J\), the null hypothesis is more likely to be rejected for alternatives far from \(H\)0 (large \(\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}\)) than for alternatives close to \(H\)0. For a fixed value of \(\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}\), \(b\) decreases as the sample size \(J\) on each treatment increases, and it increases as the variance \(s\)2 increases (since greater underlying variability makes it more difficult to detect any given departure from \(H\)0).

Because hand computation of \(b\) and sample size determination for the \(F\) test are quite difficult (as in the case of \(t\) tests), statisticians have constructed sets of curves from which \(b\) can be obtained. Sets of curves for numerator df \(v\)1 = 3 and \(v\)1 = 4 are displayed in Figures. 11.5 and 11.6, respectively. After the values of \(s\)2 and the _a__i_'s for which \(b\) is desired are specified, these are used to compute the value of _ph_, where \(\phi^{2}=(J/I)\sum\alpha_{i}^{2}/\sigma^{2}\). We then enter the appropriate set of curves at the

Figure 11.5: Power curves for the ANOVA \(F\) test (_ν_1 = 3) (E. S. Pearson and H. O. Hartley, “Charts of the Power Function for Analysis of Variance Tests, Derived from the Non-central \(F\) Distribution,” _Biometrika_, vol. 38, 1951: 112, by permission of Biometrika Trustees.)value of \(\phi\) on the horizontal axis, move up to the curve associated with error df \(v_{2}\), and move over to the value of power on the vertical axis. Finally, \(\beta=1-\)power.

The effects of four different heat treatments on yield point (tons/in\({}^{2}\)) of steel ingots are to be investigated. A total of eight ingots will be cast using each treatment. Suppose the true standard deviation of yield point for any of the four treatments is \(\sigma=1\). How likely is it that \(H_{0}\) will not be rejected at level.05 if three of the treatments have the same expected yield point and the other treatment has an expected yield point that is 1 ton/in.\({}^{2}\)greater than the common value of the other three (i.e., the fourth yield is on average 1 standard deviation above those for the first three treatments)?

Suppose that \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{3}\) and \(\mu_{4}=\mu_{1}+1\), \(\mu=(\Sigma\mu_{i})/4=\mu_{1}+\frac{1}{4}\). Then \(\alpha_{1}=\mu_{1}-\mu=-\frac{1}{4}\), \(\alpha_{2}=-\frac{1}{4}\), \(\alpha_{3}=-\frac{1}{4}\), \(\alpha_{4}=\frac{3}{4}\) so

\[\phi^{2}=\frac{8}{4}\left[\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2}+\left(-\frac{1}{4} \right)^{2}+\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{2}\right] =\frac{3}{2}\]

and \(\phi=1.22\). The degrees of freedom are \(v_{1}=I-1=3\) and \(v_{2}=I(J-1)=28\), so interpolating visually between \(v_{2}=20\) and \(v_{2}=30\) gives power \(\approx.47\) and \(\beta\approx.53\). This \(\beta\) is rather large, so we might decide to increase the value of \(J\). How many ingots of each type would be required to yield \(\beta\approx.05\) for the alternative under consideration? By trying different values of \(J\), we can verify that \(J=24\) will meet the requirement, but any smaller \(J\) will not.

As an alternative to the use of power curves, many statistical packages have a function that calculates the cumulative area under a noncentral \(F\) curve (inputs \(F_{\alpha}\), numerator df, denominator df, and \(\phi^{2}\)), and this area is \(\beta\). In addition, MINITAB 16

Figure 11.6: Power curves for the ANOVA \(F\) test (\(\boldsymbol{v}_{1}=\boldsymbol{4}\)) (E. S. Pearson and H. O. Hartley, “Charts of the Power Function for Analysis of Variance Tests, Derived from the Non–central \(F\) Distribution,” _Biometrika_, vol. 38, 1951: 112, by permission of Biometrika Trustees.)

does something rather different. The user is asked to specify the maximum difference between \(\mu_{i}\)'s rather than the individual means. For example, we might wish to calculate the power of the test with \(\alpha=.05\), \(\sigma=1\), \(I=4\), \(J=2\), \(\mu_{1}=100\), \(\mu_{2}=101\), \(\mu_{3}=102\), and \(\mu_{4}=106\). Then the maximum difference is 106 - 100 = 6. However, the power depends not only on this maximum difference but on the values of all the \(\mu_{i}\)'s. In this situation MINITAB calculates the smallest possible value of power subject to \(\mu_{1}=100\) and \(\mu_{4}=106\), which occurs when the two other \(\mu\)'s are both halfway between 100 and 106. This power is.86, so we can say that the power is at least.86 and \(\beta\) is at most.14 when the two most extreme \(\mu\)'s are separated by 6. The software will also determine the necessary common sample size if maximum difference and minimum power are specified. The R package has a function that allows specification of all \(I\) of the means, along with the other parameters. The function calculates whichever parameter is omitted. For example, in the above scenario with \(\alpha=.05\), \(\sigma=1\), \(I=4\), \(J=2\), \(\mu_{1}=100\), \(\mu_{2}=101\), \(\mu_{3}=102\), and \(\mu_{4}=106\), the function calculates power \(=.89\).

### Relationship of the \(F\) Test to the \(t\) Test

When the number of populations is just \(I=2\), the ANOVA \(F\) is testing \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}\neq\mu_{2}\). In this case, a two-tailed, two-sample \(t\) test can also be used. In Section 10.2, we mentioned the pooled \(t\) test, which requires equal variances, as an alternative to the two-sample \(t\) procedure. With a little algebra, it can be shown that the single-factor ANOVA \(F\) test and the two-tailed pooled \(t\) test are equivalent; for any given data set, the _P_-values for the two tests will be identical, so the same conclusion will be reached by either test.

The two-sample \(t\) test is more flexible than the \(F\) test when \(I=2\) for two reasons. First, it is not based on the assumption that \(\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}\); second, it can be used to test \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}>\mu_{2}\) (an upper-tailed \(t\) test) or \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}<\mu_{2}\) as well as \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}\neq\mu_{2}\). As mentioned at the end of Section 11.1, there is a generalization of the two-sample \(t\) test for \(I\geq 3\) samples with population variances not necessarily the same.

### Single-Factor ANOVA When Sample Sizes Are Unequal

When the sample sizes from each population or treatment are not equal, let \(J_{1},J_{2},\ldots\), \(J_{I}\) denote the \(I\) sample sizes and let \(n=\Sigma_{j}J_{i}\) denote the total number of observations. The accompanying box gives ANOVA formulas and the test procedure.

Test statistic value:

\[f = \frac{\text{MSTr}}{\text{MSE}}\text{ \ \ \ \ where \ \ \ MSTr} = \frac{\text{SSTr}}{I - 1}\text{ \ \ \ \ and \ \ \ MSE} = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - I}\]

Rejection region: \(f \geq F_{\alpha,I - 1,n - I}\)

The correction factor (CF) \(X_{\cdot \cdot }^{2}/n\) is subtracted when computing both SST and SSTr. These formulas are derived in the same way (see Exercise 28) as the similar formulas in Section 11.1, except that it is harder here to show that MSTr/MSE has the \(F\) distribution under \(H_{0}\).

The article "On the Development of a New Approach for the Determination of Yield Strength in Mg-Based Alloys" (_Light Metal Age_, Oct. 1998: 51-53) presented the following data on elastic modulus (GPa) obtained by a new ultrasonic method for specimens of an alloy produced using three different casting processes.

Let \(\mu_{1}\), \(\mu_{2}\), and \(\mu_{3}\) denote the true average elastic moduli for the three different processes under the given circumstances. The relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1} = \mu_{2} = \mu_{3}\) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): at least two of the \(\mu_{i}\)'s are different. The test statistic is, of course, \(F = \text{MSTr}/\text{MSE}\), based on \(I - 1 = 2\) numerator df and \(n - I = 22 - 3 = 19\) denominator df. Relevant quantities include

\[\sum\sum x_{ij}^{2} = 43,998.73\text{ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ CF} = \frac{983.7^{2}}{22} = 43,984.80\]

\[\text{SST} = 43,998.73 - 43,984.80 = 13.93\]

\[\text{SSTr} = \frac{357.7^{2}}{8} + \frac{352.5^{2}}{8} + \frac{273.5^{2}}{6} - 43,984.80 = 7.93\]

\[\text{SSE} = 13.93 - 7.93 = 6.00\]

The remaining computations are displayed in the accompanying ANOVA table. Since \(F_{.001,2,19} = 10.16 < 12.56 = f\), the \(P\)-value is smaller than.001. Thus the null hypothesis should be rejected at any reasonable significance level; there is compelling evidence for concluding that true average elastic modulus somehow depends on which casting process is used.

## Multiple Comparisons When Sample Sizes Are Unequal

There is more controversy among statisticians regarding which multiple comparisons procedure to use when sample sizes are unequal than there is in the case of equal sample sizes. The procedure that we present here is recommended in the excellent book _Beyond ANOVA: Basics of Applied Statistics_ (see the chapter bibliography) for use when the \(I\) sample sizes \(J_{1}\), \(J_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(J_{I}\) are reasonably close to each other ("mild imbalance"). It modifies Tukey's method by using averages of pairs of 1/\(J_{i}\)'s in place of 1/\(J\).

Let

\[w_{ij}=Q_{x,I,n-I}\cdot\sqrt{\frac{\text{MSE}}{2}\left(\frac{1}{J_{i}}+\frac{1 }{J_{j}}\right)}\]

Then the probability is _approximately_ 1 - \(\alpha\) that

\[\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j\cdot}-w_{ij}\leq\mu_{i}-\mu_{j}\leq \overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j\cdot}+w_{ij}\]

for every \(i\) and \(j\) (\(i=1\), \(\ldots\), \(I\) and \(j=1\), \(\ldots\), \(I\)) with \(i\neq j\).

The simultaneous confidence level 100(1 - \(\alpha\))% is only approximate rather than exact as it is with equal sample sizes. The underscoring method can still be used, but now the \(w_{ij}\) factor used to decide whether \(\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\) and \(\bar{x}_{j\cdot}\) can be connected will depend on \(J_{i}\) and \(J_{j}\).

The sample sizes for the elastic modulus data were \(J_{1}=8\), \(J_{2}=8\), \(J_{3}=6\), and \(I=3\), \(n-I=19\), \(\text{MSE}=.316\). A simultaneous confidence level of approximately 95% requires \(\text{Q}_{.05,3,19}=3.59\), from which

\[w_{12}=3.59\sqrt{\frac{.316}{2}\left(\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}\right)}=.713\quad w _{13}=.771\quad w_{23}=.771\]

Since \(\bar{x}_{1\cdot}-\bar{x}_{2\cdot}=44.71-44.06=.65<w_{12}\), \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\) are judged not significantly different. The accompanying underscoring scheme shows that \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{3}\) differ significantly, as do \(\mu_{2}\) and \(\mu_{3}\).

## Data Transformation

The use of ANOVA methods can be invalidated by substantial differences in the variances \(\sigma_{1}^{2},\ldots,\sigma_{I}^{2}\) (which until now have been assumed equal with common value \(\sigma^{2}\)). It sometimes happens that \(V(X_{ij})=\sigma_{i}^{2}=g(\mu_{i})\), a known function of \(\mu_{i}\) (so that when \(H_{0}\) is false, the variances are not equal). For example, if \(X_{ij}\) has a Poisson distribution with parameter \(\lambda_{i}\) (approximately normal if \(\lambda_{i}\geq 10\)), then \(\mu_{i}=\lambda_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{i}^{2}=\lambda_{i}\), so \(g(\mu_{i})=\mu_{i}\) is the known function. In such cases, one can often transform the \(X_{ij}\)'s to \(h(X_{ij})\)'s so that they will have approximately equal variances (while hopefully leaving the transformed variables approximately normal), and then the \(F\) test can be used on the transformed observations. The basic idea is that, if \(h(\cdot)\) is a smooth function, then we can express it approximately using the first terms of a Taylor series, \(h(X_{ij})\approx h(\mu_{i})+h^{\prime}(\mu_{i})(X_{ij}-\mu_{i})\). Then \(V[h(X_{ij})]\approx V(X_{ij})\cdot[h^{\prime}(\mu_{i})]^{2}=g(\mu_{i})\cdot[h^ {\prime}(\mu_{i})]^{2}\). We now wish to find the function \(h(\cdot)\) for which \(g(\mu_{i})\cdot[h^{\prime}(\mu_{i})]^{2}=c\) (a constant) for every \(i\). Solving this for \(h^{\prime}(\mu_{i})\) and integrating gives the following result:

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{**PROPOSITION**} & If \(V(X_{ij})=g(\mu_{i})\), a known function of \(\mu_{i}\), then a transformation \(h(X_{ij})\) that "stabilizes the variance" so that \(V[h(X_{ij})]\) is approximately the same for each \(i\) is given by \(h(x)\propto\int[g(x)]^{-1/2}\ dx\). \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In the Poisson case, \(g(x)=x\), so \(h(x)\) should be proportional to \(\int x^{-1/2}\ dx=2\ x^{1/2}\). Thus Poisson data should be transformed to \(h(x_{ij})=\sqrt{x_{ij}}\) before the analysis.

## A Random Effects Model

The single-factor problems considered so far have all been assumed to be examples of a **fixed effects** ANOVA model. By this we mean that the chosen levels of the factor under study are the only ones considered relevant by the experimenter. The single-factor fixed effects model is

\[X_{ij}=\mu_{i}+\alpha_{i}+\varepsilon_{ij}\qquad\sum\alpha_{i}=0 \tag{11.6}\]

where the \(\varepsilon_{ij}\)'s are random and both \(\mu\) and the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s are fixed parameters whose values are unknown.

In some single-factor problems, the particular levels studied by the experimenter are chosen, either by design or through sampling, from a large population of levels. For example, to study the effects on task performance time of using different operators on a particular machine, a sample of five operators might be chosen from a large pool of operators. Similarly, the effect of soil pH on the yield of maize plants might be studied by using soils with four specific pH values chosen from among the many possible pH levels. When the levels used are selected at random from a larger population of possible levels, the factor is said to be random rather than fixed, and the fixed effects model (11.6) is no longer appropriate. An analogous **random effects** model is obtained by replacing the fixed \(\alpha_{i}\)'s in (11.6) by random variables. The resulting model description isThe condition \(E(A_{i})=0\) in (11.7) is similar to the condition \(\Sigma\alpha_{i}=0\) in (11.6); it states that the expected or average effect of the \(i\)th level measured as a departure from \(\mu\) is zero.

For the random effects model (11.7), the hypothesis of no effects due to different levels is \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma_{A}^{2}=0\) which says that different levels of the factor contribute nothing to variability of the response. _Although the hypotheses in the single-factor fixed and random effects models are different, they are tested in exactly the same way_, by forming \(F=\text{MSTr}/\text{MSE}\) and rejecting \(H_{0}\) if \(f\geq F_{\alpha J-1,n-J}\). This can be justified intuitively by noting that \(E(\text{MSE})=\sigma^{2}\) (as for fixed effects), whereas

\[E(\text{MSTr})=\sigma^{2}+\frac{1}{I-1}\left(n-\frac{\sum J_{i}^{2}}{n}\right) \sigma_{A}^{2} \tag{11.8}\]

where \(J_{1}\), \(J_{2}\),\(\ldots\), \(J_{I}\) are the sample sizes and \(n=\Sigma J_{i}\). The factor in parentheses on the right side of (11.8) is nonnegative, so once again \(E(\text{MSTr})=\sigma^{2}\) if \(H_{0}\) is true and \(E(\text{MSTr})>\sigma^{2}\) if \(H_{0}\) is false.

The study of nondestructive forces and stresses in materials furnishes important information for efficient design. The article "Zero-Force Travel-Time Parameters for Ultrasonic Head-Waves in Railroad Rail" (_Mater. Eval._, 1985: 854-858) reports on a study of travel time for a type of wave that results from longitudinal stress of rails used for railroad track. Three measurements were made on each of six rails randomly selected from a population of rails. The investigators used random effects ANOVA to decide whether some variation in travel time could be attributed to "between-rail variability." The data is given in the accompanying table (each value, in nanoseconds, resulted from subtracting 36.1 \(\mu\)s from the original observation) along with the derived ANOVA table. The value of the \(F\) ratio is highly significant, so \(H_{0}\): \(\sigma_{A}^{2}=0\) is rejected in favor of the conclusion that differences between rails are a source of travel-time variability.

* [22] The following data refers to yield of tomatoes (kg/plot) for four different levels of salinity; salinity level here refers to electrical conductivity (EC), where the chosen levels were EC = 1.6, 3.8, 6.0, and 10.2 mmhos/cm: 1.6: 59.5 53.3 56.8 63.1 58.7 3.8: 55.2 59.1 52.8 54.5 6.0: 51.7 48.8 53.9 49.0 10.2: 44.6 48.5 41.0 47.3 46.1

Use the \(F\) test at level \(a\) =.05 to test for any differences in true average yield due to the different salinity levels.
* Apply the modified Tukey's method to the data in Exercise 22 to identify significant differences among the _m__i_'s.
* The following partial ANOVA table is taken from the article "Perception of Spatial Incongruity" (_J. Nerv. Ment. Dis._, 1961: 222) in which the abilities of three different groups to identify a perceptual incongruity were assessed and compared. All individuals in the experiment had been hospitalized to undergo psychiatric treatment. There were 21 individuals in the depressive group, 32 individuals in the functional "other" group, and 21 individuals in the brain-damaged group. Complete the ANOVA table and carry out the \(F\) test at level \(a\) =.01.

* Lipids provide much of the dietary energy in the bodies of infants and young children. There is a growing interest in the quality of the dietary lipid supply during infancy as a major determinant of growth, visual and neural development, and long-term health. The article "Essential Fat Requirements of Preterm Infants" (_Amer. J. Clin. Nutrit._, 2000: 245S-250S) reported the following data on total polyunsaturated fats (%) for infants who were randomized to four different feeding regimens: breast milk, corn-oil-based formula, soy-oil-based formula, or soy-and-marine-oil-based formula:
* What assumptions must be made about the four total polyunsaturated fat distributions before carrying out a single-factor ANOVA to decide whether there are any differences in true average fat content?
* Carry out the test suggested in part (a). What can be said about the _P_-value?
* Samples of six different brands of diet/imitation margarine were analyzed to determine the level of physiologically active polyunsaturated fatty acids (PAPFUA, in percentages), resulting in the following data: 1.13.6 14.4 14.3 _Parkay_ 12.8 12.5 13.4 13.0 12.3 _Blue Bonnet_ 13.5 13.4 14.1 14.3 _Chiffon_ 13.2 12.7 12.6 13.9 _Mazola_ 16.8 17.2 16.4 17.3 18.0 _Fleischmann's_ 18.1 17.2 18.7 18.4 (The preceding numbers are fictitious, but the sample means agree with data reported in the January 1975 issue of _Consumer Reports._)
* Use ANOVA to test for differences among the true average PAPFUA percentages for the different brands.
* Compute CIs for all (\(m_{i}\) - \(m_{j}\))'s.
* Mazola and Fleischmann's are corn-based, whereas the others are soybean-based. Compute a CI for \[\frac{\mu_{1} + \mu_{2} + \mu_{3} + \mu_{4}}{4} - \frac{\mu_{5} + \mu_{6}}{2}\] [_Hint_: Modify the expression for \(V(\hat{\theta})\) that led to (11.5) in the previous section.]
* Although tea is the world's most widely consumed beverage after water, little is known about its nutritional value. Folacpresent in any significant amount in tea, and recent advances in assay methods have made accurate determination of folacin content feasible. Consider the accompanying data on folacin content for randomly selected specimens of the four leading brands of green tea.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Brand** & \multicolumn{6}{c}{**Observations**} \\ \hline
1 & 7.9 & 6.2 & 6.6 & 8.6 & 8.9 & 10.1 & 9.6 \\
2 & 5.7 & 7.5 & 9.8 & 6.1 & 8.4 & & \\
3 & 6.8 & 7.5 & 5.0 & 7.4 & 5.3 & 6.1 & \\

Does this data suggest that true average folacin content is the same for all brands? **a.** Carry out a test using \(\alpha=.05\) via the _P_-value method. **b.** Assess the plausibility of any assumptions required for your analysis in part (a). **c.** Perform a multiple comparisons analysis to identify significant differences among brands.
28. In single-factor ANOVA with sample sizes \(J_{i}\) (\(i=1\), \(\ldots\), \(I\)), show that \(\text{SSTr}=\sum J_{i}(\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot})^{2}= \sum_{i}J_{i}\overline{X}_{i\cdot}^{2}-n\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}^{2}\), where \(n=\sum J_{i}\).
29. When sample sizes are equal (\(J_{i}=J\)), the parameters \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{2}\),..., \(\alpha_{I}\) of the alternative parameterization are restricted by \(\Sigma\alpha_{i}=0\). For unequal sample sizes, the most natural restriction is \(\Sigma J_{i}\alpha_{i}=0\). Use this to show that \[E(\text{MSTr})=\sigma^{2}+\frac{1}{I-1}\sum J_{i}\alpha_{i}^{2}\] What is \(E(\text{MSTr})\) when \(H_{0}\) is true? [This expectation is correct if \(\Sigma J_{i}\alpha_{i}=0\) is replaced by the restriction \(\Sigma\alpha_{i}=0\) (or any other single linear restriction on the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s used to reduce the model to \(I\) independent parameters), but \(\Sigma J_{i}\alpha_{i}=0\) simplifies the algebra and yields natural estimates for the model parameters (in particular, \(\hat{\alpha}_{i}=\bar{x}_{i\cdot}-\bar{x}_{\cdot\cdot}\)).]
30. Reconsider Example 11.7 involving an investigation of the effects of different heat treatments on the yield point of steel ingots. **a.** If \(J=8\) and \(\sigma=1\), what is \(\beta\) for a level.05 \(F\) test when \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\), \(\mu_{3}=\mu_{1}-1\), and \(\mu_{4}=\mu_{1}+1?\) **b.** For the alternative of part (a), what value of \(J\) is necessary to obtain \(\beta=.05\)? **c.** If there are \(I=5\) heat treatments, \(J=10\), and \(\sigma=1\), what is \(\beta\) for the level.05 \(F\) test when four of the \(\mu_{i}\)'s are equal and the fifth differs by 1 from the other four?
31. For unequal sample sizes, the noncentrality parameter is \(\sum J_{i}\alpha_{i}^{2}/\sigma^{2}\) and \(\phi^{2}=(1/I)\sum J_{i}\alpha_{i}^{2}/\sigma^{2}\). Referring to Exercise 22, what is the power of the test when \(\mu_{2}=\mu_{3}\), \(\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}-\sigma\), and \(\mu_{4}=\mu_{2}+\sigma?\)

An experiment might be carried out using \(I=4\) temperature levels (10degC, 15degC, 20degC, 25degC) and \(J=3\) levels of fabric denier (420-D, 630-D, 840-D).

When factor \(A\) consists of \(I\) levels and factor \(B\) consists of \(J\) levels, there are \(IJ\) different combinations (pairs) of levels of the two factors, each called a treatment. With \(K_{ij}=\) the number of observations on the treatment consisting of factor \(A\) at level \(i\) and factor \(B\) at level \(j\), we focus in this section on the case \(K_{ij}=1\), so that the data consists of \(IJ\) observations. We will first discuss the fixed effects model, in which the only levels of interest for the two factors are those actually represented in the experiment. The case in which one or both factors are random is discussed briefly at the end of the section.

Is it really as easy to remove marks on fabrics from erasable pens as the word _erasable_ might imply? Consider the following data from an experiment to compare three different brands of pens and four different wash treatments with respect to their ability to remove marks on a particular type of fabric (based on "An Assessment of the Effects of Treatment, Time, and Heat on the Removal of Erasable Pen Marks from Cotton and Cotton/Polyester Blend Fabrics," \(J\). _Test. Eval._, 1991: 394-397). The response variable is a quantitative indicator of overall specimen color change; the lower this value, the more marks were removed.

Is there any difference in the true average amount of color change due either to the different brands of pen or to the different washing treatments?

As in single-factor ANOVA, double subscripts are used to identify random variables and observed values. Let

\(X_{ij}=\) the random variable (rv) denoting the measurement when factor \(A\) is held at level \(i\) and factor \(B\) is held at level \(j\)

\(x_{ij}=\) the observed value of \(X_{ij}\)

The \(x_{ij}\)'s are usually presented in a two-way table in which the \(i\)th row contains the observed values when factor \(A\) is held at level \(i\) and the \(j\)th column contains the observed values when factor \(B\) is held at level \(j\). In the erasable-pen experiment of Example 11.11, the number of levels of factor \(A\) is \(I=3\), the number of levels of factor \(B\) is \(J=4\), \(x_{13}=.48\), \(x_{22}=.14\), and so on.

Whereas in single-factor ANOVA we were interested only in row means and the grand mean, here we are interested also in column means. Let

\[\overline{X}_{i\cdot}=\frac{\text{the average of data obtained}}{\text{when factor }A\text{ is held at level }i}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{J}X_{ij}}{J}\]\[\overline{X}_{j}=\begin{array}{l} {\rm the\ average\ of\ data\ obtained}\\ {\rm when\ factor\ }B\ {\rm is\ held\ at\ level}\ j=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{I}X_{ij}}{I}\end{array}\]

\[\overline{X}_{\cdots}=\begin{array}{l} {\rm the\ grand\ mean}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{I}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J}X_{ij}}{IJ}\end{array}\]

with observed values \(\bar{x}_{i}\)., \(\bar{x}_{j}\), and \(\bar{x}_{\cdots}\). Totals rather than averages are denoted by omitting the horizontal bar (so \(x_{j}=\sum_{i}x_{ij}\), etc.). Intuitively, to see whether there is any effect due to the levels of factor \(A\), we should compare the observed \(\bar{x}_{i}\).'s with each other, and information about the different levels of factor \(B\) should come from the \(\bar{x}_{j}\)'s.

### The Model

Proceeding by analogy to single-factor ANOVA, one's first inclination in specifying a model is to let \(\mu_{ij}=\) the true average response when factor \(A\) is at level \(i\) and factor \(B\) at level \(j\), giving \(IJ\) mean parameters. Then let

\[X_{ij}=\mu_{ij}+\varepsilon_{ij}\]

where \(\varepsilon_{ij}\) is the random amount by which the observed value differs from its expectation and the \(\varepsilon_{ij}\)'s are assumed normal and independent with common variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Unfortunately, there is no valid test procedure for this choice of parameters. The reason is that under the alternative hypothesis of interest, the \(\mu_{ij}\)'s are free to take on any values whatsoever, whereas \(\sigma^{2}\) can be any value greater than zero, so that there are \(IJ+1\) freely varying parameters. But there are only \(IJ\) observations, so after using each \(x_{ij}\) as an estimate of \(\mu_{ij}\), there is no way to estimate \(\sigma^{2}\).

To rectify this problem of a model having more parameters than observed values, we must specify a model that is realistic yet involves relatively few parameters.

Assume the existence of \(I\) parameters \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{2}\),\(\ldots\), \(\alpha_{I}\) and \(J\) parameters \(\beta_{1}\), \(\beta_{2}\),\(\ldots\), \(\beta_{J}\) such that

\[X_{ij}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\varepsilon_{ij}\quad(i=1,\ldots,I;\quad j=1, \ldots,J)\]

so that

\[\mu_{ij}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}\]

Including \(\sigma^{2}\), there are now \(I+J+1\) model parameters, so if \(I\geq 3\) and \(J\geq 3\), there will be fewer parameters than observations [in fact, we will shortly modify (11.10) so that even \(I=2\) and/or \(J=2\) will be accommodated].

The model specified in (11.9) and (11.10) is called an **additive model** because each mean response \(\mu_{ij}\) is the sum of an effect due to factor \(A\) at level \(i\) (\(\alpha_{j}\)) and an effect due to factor \(B\) at level \(j\) (\(\beta_{j}\)). The difference between mean responses for factor \(A\) at level \(i\) and level \(i^{\prime}\) when \(B\) is held at level \(j\) is \(\mu_{ij}-\mu_{ij^{\prime}}\). When the model is additive,

\[\mu_{ij}-\mu_{ij}=(\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j})-(\alpha_{i^{\prime}}+\beta_{j})=\alpha _{i}-\alpha_{i^{\prime}}\]

which is independent of the level \(j\) of the second factor. A similar result holds for \(\mu_{ij}-\mu_{ij^{\prime}}\). Thus additivity means that the difference in mean responses for two levels of one of the factors is the same for all levels of the other factor. Figure 11.7(a) shows a set of mean responses that satisfy the condition of additivity (which implies parallel lines), and Figure 11.7(b) shows a nonadditive configuration of mean responses.

When we plot the observed \(x_{ij}\)'s in a manner analogous to that of Figure 11.7, we get the result shown in Figure 11.8. Although there is some "crossing over" in the observed \(x_{ij}\)'s, the configuration is reasonably representative of what would be expected under additivity with just one observation per treatment.

## Test Procedures

The description and analysis now follow closely that for single-factor ANOVA. The relevant sums of squares and their computing forms are given by

\[\begin{split}\text{SST}&=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J} \left(X_{ij}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}X _{ij}^{2}-\frac{1}{IJ}X_{\cdot\cdot}^{2}\qquad\text{df}&=IJ-1\\ \text{SSA}&=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left( \overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{J}\sum_{i =1}^{I}X_{i\cdot}^{2}-\frac{1}{IJ}X_{\cdot\cdot}^{2}\qquad\text{df}& =I-1\\ \text{SSB}&=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left( \overline{X}_{j}-\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{I}\sum_{j=1}^{ J}X_{\cdot j}^{2}-\frac{1}{IJ}X_{\cdot\cdot}^{2}\qquad\text{df}& =J-1\\ \text{SSE}&=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left(X_{ij}-\overline{X}_{i\cdot}-\overline{X}_{j}+\overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}\right)^{2}\qquad\qquad\text{df}&=(I-1)(J-1)\end{split} \tag{11.13}\]

and the fundamental identity

\[\text{SST}=\text{SSA}+\text{SSB}+\text{SSE} \tag{11.14}\]

allows SSE to be determined by subtraction.

The expression for SSE results from replacing \(\mu\), \(\alpha_{i}\), and \(\beta_{j}\) in \(\Sigma[X_{ij}-(\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j})]^{2}\) by their respective estimators. Error df is \(IJ\) - number of mean parameters estimated \(=IJ-[1+(I-1)+(J-1)]=(I-1)(J-1)\). As in single-factor ANOVA, total variation is split into a part (SSE) that is not explained by either the truth or the falsity of \(H_{0A}\) or \(H_{0B}\) and two parts that can be explained by possible falsity of the two null hypotheses.

Forming \(F\) ratios as in single-factor ANOVA, we can show as in Section 11.1 that if \(H_{0A}\) is true, the corresponding \(F\) ratio has an \(F\) distribution with numerator \(\text{df}=I-1\) and denominator \(\text{df}=(I-1)(J-1)\); an analogous result applies when testing \(H_{0B}\).

The \(x_{i\cdot}\)'s (row totals) and \(x_{\cdot j}\)'s (column totals) for the color change data are displayed along the right and bottom margins of the data table in Example 11.11. In addition, \(\sum\sum x_{ij}^{2}=3.2987\) and the correction factor is \(x_{\cdot\cdot}^{2}/(IJ)=(5.59)^{2}/12=2.6040\). The sums of squares are then\[\text{SST} = 3.2987-2.6040=.6947\] \[\text{SSA} = \frac{1}{4}[2.39^{2}+1.38^{2}+1.82^{2}]-2.6040=.1282\] \[\text{SSB} = \frac{1}{3}[2.41^{2}+1.01^{2}+1.27^{2}+.90^{2}]-2.6040=.4797\] \[\text{SSE} =.6947-(.1282+.4797)=.0868\]

The accompanying ANOVA table (Table 11.5) summarizes further calculations.

The critical value for testing \(H_{0A}\) at level of significance.05 is \(F_{.05,2.6}=5.14\). Since \(4.43<5.14\), \(H_{0A}\) cannot be rejected at significance level.05. Based on this (small) data set, we cannot conclude that true average color change depends on brand of pen. Because \(F_{.05,3.6}=4.76\) and \(11.05\geq 4.76\), \(H_{0B}\) is rejected at significance level.05 in favor of the assertion that color change varies with washing treatment. A statistical computer package gives \(P\)-values of.066 and.007 for these two tests.

How can plausibility of the normality and constant variance assumptions be investigated graphically? Define the predicted values (also called fitted values) \(\hat{x}_{ij}=\hat{\mu}+\hat{x}_{i}+\hat{\beta}_{j}=\bar{x}_{\cdot}+(\bar{x}_{ i\cdot}-\bar{x}_{\cdot})+(\bar{x}_{j}-\bar{x}_{\cdot})=\bar{x}_{i\cdot}+\bar{x}_{j }-\bar{x}_{\cdot}\), and the residuals (the differences between the observations and predicted values) \(x_{ij}-\hat{x}_{ij}=x_{ij}-\bar{x}_{i\cdot}-\bar{x}_{j}+\bar{x}_{\cdot\cdot}\). We can check the normality assumption with a normal plot of the residuals, Figure 11.9(a), and we can check the constant variance assumption with a plot of the residuals against the fitted values, Figure 11.9(b).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline
**Source of Variation** & **df** & **Sum of Squares** & **Mean Square** & \(f\) \\ \hline Factor \(A\) (pen brand) & \(I\)–1 = 2 & SSA =.1282 & MSA =.0641 & \(f_{A}=4.43\) \\ Factor \(B\) (wash treatment) & \(J\)–1 = 3 & SSB =.4797 & MSB =.1599 & \(f_{B}=11.05\) \\ Error & (\(I\)–1)(\(J\)–1) = 6 & SSE =.0868 & MSE =.01447 \\ Total & \(IJ\)–1 = 11 & SST =.6947 & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11.5: ANOVA table for Example 11.13

Figure 11.9: Plots from MINITAB for Example 11.13

The normal plot is reasonably straight, so there is no reason to question normality for this data set. On the plot of the residuals against the fitted values, we are looking for differences in vertical spread as we move horizontally across the graph. For example, if there were a narrow range for small fitted values and a wide range for high fitted values, this would suggest that the variance is higher for larger responses (this happens often, and it can sometimes be cured by replacing each observation by its logarithm). No such problem occurs here, so there is no evidence against the constant variance assumption. 

## Expected Mean Squares

The plausibility of using the \(F\) tests just described is demonstrated by determining the expected mean squares. After some tedious algebra,

\[E(\text{MSE}) = \sigma^{2}\text{ (when the model is additive)}\] \[E(\text{MSA}) = \sigma^{2}+\frac{J}{I-1}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\alpha_{i}^{2}\] \[E(\text{MSB}) = \sigma^{2}+\frac{I}{J-1}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\beta_{j}^{2}\]

When \(H_{0A}\) is true, MSA is an unbiased estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\), so \(F\) is a ratio of two unbiased estimators of \(\sigma^{2}\). When \(H_{0A}\) is false, MSA tends to overestimate \(\sigma^{2}\), so \(H_{0A}\) should be rejected when the ratio \(F_{A}\) is too large. Similar comments apply to MSB and \(H_{0B}\).

### Multiple Comparisons

When either \(H_{0A}\) or \(H_{0B}\) has been rejected, Tukey's procedure can be used to identify significant differences between the levels of the factor under investigation. The steps in the analysis are identical to those for a single-factor ANOVA:

1. For comparing levels of factor \(A\), obtain \(Q_{\alpha,I,(I-1)(J-1)}\). For comparing levels of factor \(B\), obtain \(Q_{\alpha,J,(I-1)(J-1)}\).
2. Compute \(w = Q\)-(estimated standard deviation of the sample means being compared) \[= \left\{\begin{array}{l}Q_{\alpha,I,(I-1)(J-1)}\cdot\sqrt{\text{MSE}/J}\text{ for factor }A\text{ comparisons}\\ Q_{\alpha,J,(I-1)(J-1)}\cdot\sqrt{\text{MSE}/I}\text{ for factor }B\text{ comparisons}\end{array}\right.\] (because, e.g., the standard deviation of \(\overline{X}_{i}\). is \(\sigma/\sqrt{J}\)).
3. Arrange the sample means in increasing order, underscore those pairs differing by less than \(w\), and identify pairs not underscored by the same line as corresponding to significantly different levels of the given factor.

Identification of significant differences among the four washing treatments requires \(Q_{05,4,6}=4.90\) and \(w=4.90\sqrt{.01447/3}=.340\). The four factor \(B\) sample means (column averages) are now listed in increasing order, and any pair differing by less than.340 is underscored by a line segment:Washing treatment 1 is significantly worse than the other three treatments, but no other significant differences are identified. In particular, it is not apparent which among treatments 2, 3, and 4 is best at removing marks.

### Randomized Block Experiments

In using single-factor ANOVA to test for the presence of effects due to the \(I\) different treatments under study, once the _IJ_ subjects or experimental units have been chosen, treatments should be allocated in a completely random fashion. That is, \(J\) subjects should be chosen at random for the first treatment, then another sample of \(J\) chosen at random from the remaining _IJ_ - \(J\) subjects for the second treatment, and so on.

It frequently happens, though, that subjects or experimental units exhibit differences with respect to other characteristics that may affect the observed responses. For example, some patients might be healthier than others. When this is the case, the presence or absence of a significant \(F\) value may be due to these differences rather than to the presence or absence of factor effects. This was the reason for introducing a paired experiment in Chapter 10. The generalization of the paired experiment to \(I\) > 2 is called a **randomized block** experiment. An extraneous factor, "blocks," is constructed by dividing the _IJ_ units into \(J\) groups with \(I\) units in each group. This grouping or blocking is done in such a way that within each block, the \(I\) units are homogeneous with respect to other factors thought to affect the responses. Then within each homogeneous block, the \(I\) treatments are randomly assigned to the \(I\) units or subjects in the block.

A consumer product-testing organization wished to compare the annual power consumption for five different brands of dehumidifier. Because power consumption depends on the prevailing humidity level, it was decided to monitor each brand at four different levels ranging from moderate to heavy humidity (thus blocking on humidity level). Within each level, brands were randomly assigned to the five selected locations. The resulting amount of power consumption (annual kWh) appears in Table 11.6.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{4}{c}{**Blocks (humidity level)**} \\ \cline{2-7}

\[\text{SST} = 15,178,901.00-15,007,781.25=171,119.75\] \[\text{SSA} = \frac{1}{4}[60,244,049]-15,007,781.25=53,231.00\] \[\text{SSB} = \frac{1}{5}[75,619,995]-15,007,781.25=116,217.75\]

and

\[\text{SSE}=171,119.75-53,231.00-116,217.75=1671.00\]

The ANOVA calculations are summarized in Table 11.7

Since \(F_{.05,4,12}=3.26\) and \(f_{A}=95.57\geq 3.26\), \(H_{0}\) is rejected in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\), and we conclude that power consumption does depend on the brand of humidifier. To identify significantly different brands, we use Tukey's procedure. \(Q_{.05,5,12}=4.51\) and \(w=4.51\sqrt{139.25/4}=26.6\).

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}\bar{x}_{1}.&\bar{x}_{3}.&\bar{x}_{2}.&\bar{x}_{4}&\bar {x}_{5}.\\ 797.50&839.00&843.50&914.00&937.25\end{array}\]

The underscoring indicates that the brands can be divided into three groups with respect to power consumption.

Because the block factor is of secondary interest, \(F_{.05,3,12}\) is not needed, though the computed value of \(F_{B}\) is clearly highly significant. Figure 11.10 shows SAS output for this data. Notice that in the first part of the ANOVA table, the sums of squares (SS's) for treatments (brands) and blocks (humidity levels) are combined into a single "model" SS.

In many experimental situations in which treatments are to be applied to subjects, a single subject can receive all \(I\) of the treatments. Blocking is then often done on the subjects themselves to control for variability between subjects; each subject is then said to act as its own control. Social scientists sometimes refer to such experiments as repeated-measures designs. The "units" within a block are then the different "instances" of treatment application. Similarly, blocks are often taken as different time periods, locations, or observers.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \hline \hline
**Source of Variation** & **df** & **Sum of Squares** & **Mean Square** & \(f\) \\ \hline Treatments (brands) & 4 & 53,231.00 & 13,307.75 & \(f_{A}=95.57\) \\ Blocks & 3 & 116,217.75 & 38,739.25 & \(f_{B}=278.20\) \\ Error & 12 & 1671.00 & 139.25 & \\ Total & 19 & 171,119.75 & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11.7: ANOVA table for Example 11.15In most randomized block experiments in which subjects serve as blocks, the subjects actually participating in the experiment are selected from a large population. The subjects then contribute random rather than fixed effects. This does not affect the procedure for comparing treatments when \(K_{ij}=1\) (one observation per "cell," as in this section), but the procedure is altered if \(K_{ij}=K>1\). We will shortly consider two-factor models in which effects are random.

**More on Blocking** When \(I=2\), either the \(F\) test or the paired differences \(t\) test can be used to analyze the data. The resulting conclusion will not depend on which procedure is used, since \(T^{2}=F\) and \(t_{\alpha/2,\nu}^{2}=F_{\alpha,1,\nu}\)

Just as with pairing, blocking entails both a potential gain and a potential loss in precision. If there is a great deal of heterogeneity in experimental units, the value of the variance parameter \(\sigma^{2}\) in the one-way model will be large. The effect of blocking is to filter out the variation represented by \(\sigma^{2}\) in the two-way model appropriate for a randomized block experiment. Other things being equal, a smaller

Figure 11.10: SAS output for consumption data

value of \(\sigma^{2}\) results in a test that is more likely to detect departures from \(H_{0}\) (i.e., a test with greater power).

However, other things are not equal here, since the single-factor \(F\) test is based on \(I(J-1)\) degrees of freedom (df) for error, whereas the two-factor \(F\) test is based on \((I-1)(J-1)\) df for error. Fewer degrees of freedom for error results in a decrease in power, essentially because the denominator estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\) is not as precise. This loss in degrees of freedom can be especially serious if the experimenter can afford only a small number of observations. Nevertheless, if it appears that blocking will significantly reduce variability, it is probably worth the loss in degrees of freedom.

## Models for Random Effects

In many experiments, the actual levels of a factor used in the experiment, rather than being the only ones of interest to the experimenter, have been selected from a much larger population of possible levels of the factor. In a two-factor situation, when this is the case for both factors, a **random effects model** is appropriate. The case in which the levels of one factor are the only ones of interest and the levels of the other factor are selected from a population of levels leads to a **mixed effects model**. The two-factor random effects model when \(K_{ij}=1\) is

\[X_{ij}=\mu+A_{i}+B_{j}+\varepsilon_{ij}\qquad(i=1,...,I;\quad j=1,...,J)\]

where the \(A_{i}\)'s, \(B_{j}\)'s, and \(\varepsilon_{ij}\)'s are all independent, normally distributed rv's with mean 0 and variances \(\sigma_{A}^{2}\),\(\sigma_{B}^{2}\), and \(\sigma^{2}\), respectively.

The hypotheses of interest are then \(H_{0A}\): \(\sigma_{A}^{2}=0\) (level of factor \(A\) does not contribute to variation in the response) versus \(H_{\rm{aA}}\): \(\sigma_{A}^{2}>0\) and \(H_{0B}\): \(\sigma_{B}^{2}=0\) versus \(H_{\rm{aB}}\): \(\sigma_{B}^{2}>0\). Whereas \(E({\rm{MSE}})=\sigma^{2}\) as before, the expected mean squares for factors \(A\) and \(B\) are now

\[E({\rm{MSA}})=\sigma^{2}+J\sigma_{A}^{2}\quad E({\rm{MSB}})=\sigma^{2}+I\sigma _{B}^{2}\]

Thus when \(H_{0A}\) (H\({}_{\rm{OB}}\)) is true, \(F_{A}(F_{B})\) is still a ratio of two unbiased estimators of \(\sigma^{2}\). It can be shown that a test with significance level \(\alpha\) for \(H_{0A}\) versus \(H_{\rm{aA}}\) still rejects \(H_{0A}\) if \(f_{A}\geq F_{\alpha J-1,(I-1)(J-1)}\), and, similarly, the same procedure as before is used to decide between \(H_{0B}\) and \(H_{\rm{aB}}\).

For the case in which factor \(A\) is fixed and factor \(B\) is random, the mixed model is

\[X_{ij}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+B_{j}+\varepsilon_{ij}\qquad(i=1,...,I;\quad j=1,...,J)\]

where \(\sum\alpha_{i}=0\), and the \(B_{j}\)'s, and \(\varepsilon_{ij}\)'s are all independent, normally distributed rv's with mean 0 and variances \(\sigma_{B}^{2}\) and \(\sigma^{2}\), respectively.

## Chapter Two-Factor ANOVA with \(K_{ij}>1\)

In Section 11.4, we analyzed data from a two-factor experiment in which there was one observation for each of the \(IJ\) combinations of levels of the two factors. To obtain valid test procedures, the \(\mu_{ij}\)'s were assumed to have an additive structure with \(\mu_{ij}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}\), \(\Sigma\alpha_{i}=\Sigma\beta_{j}=0\). Additivity means that the difference in true average responses for any two levels of the factors is the same for each level of the other factor. For example, \(\mu_{ij}-\mu_{rj}=(\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j})-(\mu+\alpha_{i^{\prime}}+\beta_{j })=\alpha_{i}-\alpha_{i^{\prime}}\) independent of the level \(j\) of the second factor. This is shown in Figure 11.7(a), in which the lines connecting true average responses are parallel.

Figure 11.7(b) depicts a set of true average responses that does not have additive structure. The lines connecting these \(\mu_{ij}\)'s are not parallel, which means that the difference in true average responses for different levels of one factor does depend on the level of the other factor. When additivity does not hold, we say that there is **interaction** between the different levels of the factors. The assumption of additivity allowed us in Section 11.4 to obtain an estimator of the random error variance \(\sigma^{2}\) (MSE) that was unbiased whether or not either null hypothesis of interest was true. When \(K_{ij}>1\) for at least one (\(i,j\)) pair, a valid estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\) can be obtained without assuming additivity. In specifying the appropriate model and deriving test procedures, we will focus on the case \(K_{ij}=K\)\(>1\), so the number of observations per "cell" (for each combination of levels) is constant.

### Parameters for the Fixed Effects Model with Interaction

Rather than use the \(\mu_{ij}\)'s themselves as model parameters, it is usual to use an equivalent set that reveals more clearly the role of interaction. Let

\[\mu=\frac{1}{IJ}\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\mu_{ij}\qquad\bar{\mu}_{i\cdot}=\frac{1}{J} \sum_{j}\mu_{ij}\qquad\bar{\mu}_{j}=\frac{1}{I}\sum_{i}\mu_{ij} \tag{11.15}\]

Thus \(\mu\) is the expected response averaged over all levels of both factors (the true grand mean), \(\bar{\mu}_{i\cdot}\) is the expected response averaged over levels of the second factor when the first factor \(A\) is held at level \(i\), and similarly for \(\bar{\mu}_{j\cdot}\). Now define

\[\alpha_{i} =\bar{\mu}_{i\cdot}-\mu=\text{the effect of factor $A$ at level $i$}\] \[\beta_{j} =\bar{\mu}_{j}-\mu=\text{the effect of factor $B$ at level $j$} \tag{11.16}\] \[\gamma_{ij} =\mu_{ij}-(\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j})\] from which \[\mu_{ij}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\gamma_{ij} \tag{11.17}\]The model is additive if and only if all \(\gamma_{ij}\)'s = 0. The \(\gamma_{ij}\)'s are referred to as the **interaction parameters.** The \(\alpha_{i}\)'s are called the **main effects for factor \(A\)**, and the \(\beta_{j}\)'s are the **main effects for factor \(B\)**. Although there are \(I\)\(\alpha_{i}\)'s, \(J\)\(\beta_{j}\)'s, and \(IJ\)\(\gamma_{ij}\)'s in addition to \(\mu\), the conditions \(\Sigma\alpha_{i}=0\), \(\Sigma\beta_{j}=0\), \(\Sigma_{j^{\prime}ij}=0\) for any \(i\), and \(\Sigma_{i^{\prime}ij}=0\) for any \(j\) [all by virtue of (11.15) and (11.16)], imply that only \(IJ\) of these new parameters are independently determined: \(\mu,I-1\) of the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s, \(J-1\) of the \(\beta_{j}\)'s, and \((I-1)(J-1)\) of the \(\gamma_{ij}\)'s.

There are now three sets of hypotheses that will be considered:

\[\begin{array}{lcl}H_{0AB}\colon\gamma_{ij}=0\text{ for all }i,j&\text{versus}&H_{\alpha AB}\colon\text{ at least one }\gamma_{ij}\neq 0\\ H_{0A}\colon\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=\cdots=\alpha_{I}=0&\text{versus}&H_{\alpha A}\colon\text{ at least one }\alpha_{i}\neq 0\\ H_{0B}\colon\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=\cdots=\beta_{J}=0&\text{versus}&H_{\alpha B} \colon\text{ at least one }\beta_{j}\neq 0\\ \hline\end{array}\]

The no-interaction hypothesis \(H_{0AB}\) is usually tested first. If \(H_{0AB}\) is not rejected, then the other two hypotheses can be tested to see whether the main effects are significant. But once \(H_{0AB}\) is rejected, we believe that the effect of factor \(A\) at any particular level depends on the level of \(B\) (and vice versa). It then does not make sense to test \(H_{0A}\) or \(H_{0B}\). In this context a picture similar to that of Figure 11.7(b) is helpful in visualizing the way the factors interact. Here the cell means are used instead of \(x_{ij}\); this type of graph is sometimes called an **interaction plot**.

In case of interaction, it may be appropriate to do a one-way ANOVA to compare levels of \(A\) separately for each level of \(B\). For example, suppose factor \(A\) involves four kinds of glue, factor \(B\) involves three types of material, the response is strength of the glue joint, and the strength rankings of the glues clearly depend on which material is being glued. In this situation with interaction, it makes sense to do three separate one-way ANOVA analyses, one for each material.

### Notation, Model, and Analysis

We now use triple subscripts for both random variables and observed values, with \(X_{ijk}\) and \(x_{ijk}\) referring to the \(k\)th observation (replication) when factor \(A\) is at level \(i\) and factor \(B\) is at level \(j\). The model is then

\[\begin{array}{l}X_{ijk}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\gamma_{ij}+\varepsilon_{ ijk}\\ i=1,...,I;\quad j=1,...,J;\quad k=1,...,K\end{array} \tag{11.18}\]

where the \(\varepsilon_{ijk}\)'s are independent and normally distributed, each with mean 0 and variance \(\sigma^{2}\).

Again a dot in place of a subscript means that we have summed over all values of that subscript, whereas a horizontal bar denotes averaging. Thus \(X_{ij}\): is the total of all \(K\) observations made for factor \(A\) at level \(i\) and factor \(B\) at level \(j\) [all observations in the (\(i,j\))th cell], and \(\overline{X}_{ij}\): is the average of these \(K\) observations.

Three different varieties of tomato (Harvester, Ife No. 1, and Pusa Early Dwarf) and four different plant densities (10, 20, 30, and 40 thousand plants per hectare) are being considered for planting in a particular region. To see whether either variety or plant density affects yield, each combination of variety and plant density is used in three different plots, resulting in the data on yields in Table 11.8 (based on the article "Effects of Plant Density on Tomato Yields in Western Nigeria," _Exper. Agric._, 1976: 43-47).

Here, \(I=3,J=4\), and \(K=3\), for a total of \(IJK=36\) observations

To test the hypotheses of interest, we again define sums of squares and present computing formulas:

\[\begin{split}\text{SST}&=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k} \left(X_{ijk}-\overline{X}_{\ldots}\right)^{2}=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}X_{ijk}^ {2}-\frac{1}{IJK}X_{\ldots}^{2}\quad\text{df}=IJK-1\\ \text{SSE}&=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}\left(X_{ijk}- \overline{X}_{ij}\right)^{2}\\ &=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}X_{ijk}^{2}-\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i}\sum_{j }X_{ij}^{2}\quad\text{df}=IJ(K-1)\\ \text{SSA}&=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}\left(\overline{ X}_{i\ldots}-\overline{X}_{\ldots}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{JK}\sum_{i}X_{i\ldots}^{2}- \frac{1}{IJK}X_{\ldots}^{2}\quad\text{df}=I-1\\ \text{SSB}&=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}\left(\overline {X}_{j\ldots}-\overline{X}_{\ldots}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{IK}\sum_{j}X_{j\ldots} ^{2}-\frac{1}{IJK}X_{\ldots}^{2}\quad\text{df}=J-1\\ \text{SSAB}&=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}\left(X_{ij\ldots}- \overline{X}_{i\ldots}-\overline{X}_{j\ldots}+\overline{X}_{\ldots}\right)^{2} \quad\text{df}=(I-1)(J-1)\end{split}\]

The fundamental identity

\[\text{SST}=\text{SSA}+\text{SSB}+\text{SSAB}+\text{SSE}\]

implies that the **interaction sum of squares** SSAB can be obtained by subtraction.

Total variation is thus partitioned into four pieces: unexplained (SSE--which would be present whether or not any of the three null hypotheses was true) and three pieces that may be explained by the truth or falsity of the three \(H_{0}\)'s. Each of four mean squares is defined by \(\text{MS}=\text{SS}/\text{df}\). The expected mean squares suggest that each set of hypotheses should be tested using the appropriate ratio of mean squares with MSE in the denominator:

\[\text{E}(\text{MSE}) = \sigma^{2}\] \[\text{E}(\text{MSA}) = \sigma^{2}+\frac{JK}{I-1}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\alpha_{i}^{2}\] \[\text{E}(\text{MSB}) = \sigma^{2}+\frac{IK}{J-1}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\beta_{j}^{2}\] \[\text{E}(\text{MSAB}) = \sigma^{2}+\frac{K}{(I-1)(J-1)}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\gamma _{ij}^{2}\]

Each of the three mean square ratios can be shown to have an \(F\) distribution when the associated \(H_{0}\) is true, which yields the following level \(\alpha\) test procedures.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Hypotheses** & **Test Statistic Value** & **Rejection Region** \\ \(H_{0A}\) versus \(H_{aA}\) & \(f_{A}\) & \(=\)\(\dfrac{\text{MSA}}{\text{MSE}}\) & \(f_{A}\geq F_{AJ-1,IJ(K-1)}\) \\ \(H_{0B}\) versus \(H_{aB}\) & \(f_{A}\) & \(=\)\(\dfrac{\text{MSB}}{\text{MSE}}\) & \(f_{B}\geq F_{AJ-1,IJ(K-1)}\) \\ \(H_{0A,B}\) versus \(H_{a,aB}\) & \(f_{AB}\) & \(=\)\(\dfrac{\text{MSAB}}{\text{MSE}}\) & \(f_{AB}\geq F_{\alpha,(I-1)(J-1),IJ(K-1)}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

As before, the results of the analysis are summarized in an ANOVA table.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Example 11.1** & **Example 11.16** & \(\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\sum_{k}x_{ijk}^{2}=\)10.5\({}^{2}+9.2^{2}+\cdots+18.9^{2}+17.2^{2}=7404.80\) \\ \(\sum_{i}x_{i\cdot}^{2}=\)136.0\({}^{2}+146.5^{2}+217.5^{2}=87\),264.50 \\ \end{tabular}

and

\[\sum_{j}x_{\cdot j}^{2}=63\text{,}280.18\]

The cell totals (\(x_{ij\cdot}\)'s) are from which \(\sum_{i}\sum_{j}x_{ij}^{2}=27.6^{2}+\cdots+54.5^{2}=22,\)100.28. Then

\[\text{SST}=7404.80-\frac{1}{36}(250,\!000)=7404.80-6944.44=460.36\]

\[\text{SSA}=\frac{1}{12}(87,\!264.50)-6944.44=327.60\]

\[\text{SSB}=\frac{1}{9}(63,\!280.18)-6944.44=86.69\]

\[\text{SSE}=7404.80-\frac{1}{3}(22,\!100.28)=38.04\]

and

\[\text{SSAB}=460.36-327.60-86.69-38.04=8.03\]

Table 11.9 summarizes the computation.

Since \(F_{.01,6,24}=3.67\) and \(f_{AB}=.84\) is not \(\geq 3.67\), \(H_{0AB}\) cannot be rejected at level.01, so we conclude that the interaction effects are not significant. Now the presence or absence of main effects can be investigated. Since \(F_{.01,2,24}=5.61\) and\(f_{A}=103.02\)\(\geq 5.61\), \(H_{0A}\) is rejected at level.01 in favor of the conclusion that different varieties do affect the true average yields. Similarly, \(f_{B}=18.18\geq 4.72=F_{.01,3,24}\), so we conclude that true average yield also depends on plant density.

Figure 11.11 shows the interaction plot. Notice the nearly parallel lines for the three tomato varieties, in agreement with the \(F\) test showing no significant interaction. The yield for Pusa Early Dwarf appears to be significantly above the yields for the other two varieties, and this is in accord with the highly significant \(F\) for varieties. Furthermore, all three varieties show the same pattern in which yield increases as the density goes up, but decreases beyond 30,000 per hectare. This suggests that planting more seed will increase the yield, but eventually overcrowding causes the yield to drop.

In this example one of the two factors is quantitative, and this is naturally the factor used for the horizontal axis in the interaction plot. In case both of the factors are quantitative, the choice for the horizontal axis would be arbitrary, but a case can be made for two plots to try it both ways. Indeed, MINITAB has an option to allow both plots to be included in the same graph.

To check the normality and constant variance assumptions we can make plots similar to those of Section 11.4. Define the predicted values (fitted values) to be the cell means, \(\hat{x}_{ijk}=\bar{x}_{ij}\), so the residuals, the differences between the observations and predicted values, are \(x_{ijk}-\bar{x}_{ij}\). The normal plot of the residuals is Figure 11.12(a), and the plot of the residuals against the fitted values is Figure 11.12(b). The normal plot is sufficiently straight that there should be no concern about the normality assumption. The plot of residuals against predicted values has a fairly uniform vertical spread, so there is no cause for concern about the constant variance assumption.

## Multiple Comparisons

When the no-interaction hypothesis \(H_{0AB}\) is not rejected and at least one of the two main-effect null hypotheses is rejected, Tukey's method can be used to identify significant differences in levels. To identify differences among the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s when \(H_{0A}\) is rejected:

1. Obtain \(Q_{x,JJU(K-1)}\), where the second subscript \(I\) identifies the number of levels being compared and the third subscript refers to the number of degrees of freedom for error.
2. Compute \(w=Q\sqrt{\text{MSE}/JK}\), where \(JK\) is the number of observations averaged to obtain each of the \(\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\)'s compared in step 3.
3. Order the \(\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\)'s from smallest to largest and, as before, underscore all pairs that differ by less than \(w\). Pairs not underscored correspond to significantly different levels of factor \(A\).

To identify different levels of factor \(B\) when \(H_{0B}\) is rejected, replace the second subscript in \(Q\) by \(J\), replace \(JK\) by \(IK\) in \(w\), and replace \(\bar{x}_{i\cdot}\) by \(\bar{x}_{j\cdot}\).

For factor \(A\) (varieties), \(I=3\), so with \(\alpha=.01\) and \(IJ(K-1)=24\), \(Q_{.01,3,24}=4.55\). Then \(w=4.55\sqrt{1.59/12}=1.66\), so ordering and underscoring gives

\[\begin{array}{ccc}\bar{x}_{1\cdot}&\bar{x}_{2\cdot}&\bar{x}_{3\cdot}\\ 11.33&12.21&18.13\end{array}\]

The Harvester and Ife varieties do not differ significantly from each other in effect on true average yield, but both differ from the Pusa variety.

For factor \(B\) (density), \(J=4\,\text{so}\,Q_{.01,4,24}=4.91\) and \(w=4.91\sqrt{1.59/9}=2.06\)

\[\begin{array}{ccc}\bar{x}_{1\cdot}&\bar{x}_{4\cdot}&\bar{x}_{2\cdot}&\bar{x} _{3\cdot}\\ 11.48&13.91&14.39&15.78\end{array}\]

Thus with experimentwise error rate.01, which is quite conservative, only the lowest density differs significantly from all others. Even with \(\alpha=.05\) (so that \(w=1.64\)), densities 2 and 3 cannot be judged significantly different from each other in their effect on yield. \(\blacksquare\)

## Models with Mixed and Random Effects

In some situations, the levels of either factor may have been chosen from a large population of possible levels, so that the effects contributed by the factor are random rather than fixed. As in Section 11.4, if both factors contribute random effects, the model is referred to as a random effects model, whereas if one factor is fixed and the other is random, a mixed effects model results. We will now consider the analysis for a mixed effects model in which factor \(A\) (rows) is the fixed factor and factor \(B\) (columns) is the random factor. When either factor is random, interaction effects will also be random. The case in which both factors are random is dealt with in Exercise 57. The mixed effects model is

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11877]

For testing \(H_{0A}\) versus \(H_{aA}\) (factors \(A\) fixed, \(B\) random), the test statistic value is \(f_{A}=\) MSA/MSAB, and the rejection region is \(f_{A}\geq F_{\alpha J-1,(I-1)(J-1)}\). The test of \(H_{0B}\) versus \(H_{aB}\) utilizes \(f_{B}=\) MSB/MSAB, and the rejection region is \(f_{B}\geq F_{\alpha J-1,(I-1)(J-1)}\).

A process engineer has identified two potential causes of electric motor vibration, the material used for the motor casing (factor \(A\)) and the supply source of bearings used in the motor (factor \(B\)). The accompanying data on the amount of vibration (microns) resulted from an experiment in which motors with casings made of steel, aluminum, and plastic were constructed using bearings supplied by five randomly selected sources.

Only the three casing materials used in the experiment are under consideration for use in production, so factor \(A\) is fixed. However, the five supply sources were randomly selected from a much larger population, so factor \(B\) is random. The relevant null hypotheses are

\[H_{0A}\text{: }\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=\alpha_{3}=0\qquad H_{0B}\text{: }\sigma_{B}^{2}=0\qquad H_{0G}\text{: }\sigma_{G}^{2}=0\]

**59**. The article "Computer-Assisted Instruction Augmented with Planned Teacher/Student Contacts" (\(J\). _Exper. Ed._, Winter 1980-1981: 120-126) compared five different methods for teaching descriptive statistics. The five methods were traditional lecture and discussion (L/D), programmed textbook instruction (R), programmed text with lectures (R/L), computer instruction (C), and computer instruction with lectures (C/L). Forty-five students were randomly assigned, 9 to each method. After completing the course, the students took a 1-h exam. In addition, a 10-minute retention test was administered 6 weeks later. Summary quantities are given.

The grand mean for the exam was 30.82, and the grand mean for the retention test was 29.30.

**a.**: Does the data suggest that there is a difference among the five teaching methods with respect to true mean exam score? Use \(\alpha=.05\).
**b.**: Using a.05 significance level, test the null hypothesis of no difference among the true mean retention test scores for the five different teaching methods.
**60.**: Numerous factors contribute to the smooth running of an electric motor ("Increasing Market Share Through Improved Product and Process Design: An Experimental Approach," _Qual. Engrg._, 1991: 361-369). In particular, it is desirable to keep motor noise and vibration to a minimum. To study the effect that the brand of bearing has on motor vibration, five different motor bearing brands were examined by installing each type of bearing on different random samples of six motors. The amount of motor vibration (measured in microns) was recorded when each of the 30 motors was running. The data for this study follows. State and test the relevant hypotheses at significance level.05, and then carry out a multiple comparisons analysis if appropriate.

**61.**: An article in the British scientific journal _Nature_ ("Sucrose Induction of Hepatic Hyperplasia in the Rat," August 25, 1972: 461) reports on an experiment in which each of five groups consisting of six rats was put on a diet with a different carbohydrate. At the conclusion of the experiment, the DNA content of the liver of each rat was determined (mg/g liver), with the following results:

\[\begin{array}{l} {\bf Carbohydrate} & {\bar{x}_{i}} \\ \hline {\bf Starch} & 2.58\\ {\bf Sucrose} & 2.63\\ {\bf Fructose} & 2.13\\ {\bf Glucose} & 2.41\\ {\bf Maltose} & 2.49\\ \hline \end{array}\]
**a.**: Assuming also that \(\sum\sum x_{ij}^{2}=183.4\), is the true average DNA content affected by the type of carbohydrate in the diet? Construct an ANOVA table and use a.05 level of significance.
**b.**: Construct a \(t\) CI for the contrast

\[\theta=\mu_{1}-(\mu_{2}+\mu_{3}+\mu_{4}+\mu_{5})/4\]

which measures the difference between the average DNA content for the starch diet and the combined average for the four other diets. Does the resulting interval include zero?
**c.**: What is \(\beta\) for the test when true average DNA content is identical for three of the diets and falls below this common value by 1 standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) for the other two diets?

The critical flicker frequency (cff) is the highest frequency (in cycles/sec) at which a person can detect the flicker in a flickering light source. At frequencies above the cff, the light source appears to be continuous even though it is actually flickering. An investigation carried out to see whether true average cff depends on iris color yielded the following data (based on the article "The Effects of Iris Color on Critical Flicker Frequency," _J. Gen. Psych._, 1973: 91-95): * State and test the relevant hypotheses at significance level.05 by using the \(F\) table to obtain an upper and/or lower bound on the _P_-value. [_Hint_: \(\sum\sum x_{ij}^{2} = 13,659.67\) and \(\text{CF} = 13,598.36\).] * Investigate differences between iris colors with respect to mean cff.
64. Recall from Section 11.2 that if \(c\)1, \(c\)2,..., \(c_{I}\) are numbers satisfying \(\Sigma c_{i} = 0\) then \(\Sigma c_{i}\mu_{i} = c_{1}\mu_{1} + \cdots + c_{i}\mu_{i}\) is called a _contrast_ in the _mi_'s. Notice that with \(c_{1} = 1\), \(c_{2} = - 1\), \(c_{3} = \cdots = c_{I} = 0\), \(\Sigma c_{i}\mu_{i} = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2}\), which implies that every pair-wise difference between _mi_'s is a contrast (so is, e.g., \(\mu_{1} -.5\mu_{2} -.5\mu_{3}\)). A method attributed to Scheffe gives simultaneous CIs with simultaneous confidence level 100(1 - _a_)% for _all_ possible contrasts (an infinite number of them!). The interval for \(\Sigma c_{i}\mu_{i}\) is \(\sum c_{i}\bar{x}_{i}\pm\sqrt{(I-1)F_{aJ-1,n-l}\text{MSE}\sum c_{i}^{2}/J_{i}}\) Using the critical flicker frequency data of Exercise 63, calculate the Scheffe intervals for the contrasts \(\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}\), \(\mu_{1} - \mu_{3}\), \(\mu_{2} - \mu_{3}\), and \(.5\mu_{1} +.5\mu_{2} - \mu_{3}\) (the last contrast compares blue to the average of brown and green). Which contrasts differ significantly from 0, and why?
65. Four types of mortars--ordinary cement mortar (OCM), polymer impregnated mortar (PIM), resin mortar (RM), and polymer cement mortar (PCM)--were subjected to a compression test to measure strength (MPa). Three strength observations for each mortar type are given in the article "Polymer Mortar Composite Matrices for Maintenance-Free Highly Durable Ferrocement" (_J. Ferrocement_, 1984: 337-345) and are reproduced here. Construct an ANOVA table. Using a.05 significance level, determine whether the data suggests that the true mean strength is not the same for all four mortar types. If you determine that the true mean strengths are not all equal, use Tukey's method to identify the significant differences. * In single-factor ANOVA, suppose the _x__ij_'s are "coded" by \(y_{ij} = cx_{ij} + d\). How does the value of the \(F\) statistic computed from the _y__ij_'s compare to the value computed from the _x__ij_'s? Justify your assertion. * In Example 11.10, subtract \(\bar{x}_{i}\) from each observation in the _i_th sample (\(i=1,\ldots,6\)) to obtain a set of 18 residuals. Then construct a normal probability plot and comment on the plausibility of the normality assumption. * The results of a study on the effectiveness of line drying on the smoothness of fabric were summarized in the article "Line-Dried vs. Machine-Dried Fabrics: Comparison of Appearance, Hand, and Consumer Acceptance" (_Home Econ. Res. J._, 1984: 27-35). Smoothness scores were given for nine different types of fabric and five different drying methods: (1) machine dry, (2) line dry, (3) line dry followed by 15-min tumble, (4) line dry with softener, and (5) line dry with air movement. Regarding the different types of fabric as blocks, construct an ANOVA table. * Using a.05 significance level, test to see whether there is a difference in the true mean smoothness score for the drying methods. *. Make a plot like Figure 11.8 with fabric on the horizontal axis. Discuss the result of part (a) in terms of the plot. **c.** Did the two methods involving the dryer yield significantly smoother fabric compared to the other three?
69. The water absorption of two types of mortar used to repair damaged cement was discussed in the article "Polymer Mortar Composite Matrices for Maintenance-Free, Highly Durable Ferrocement" (\(J\). _Ferrocement_, 1984: 337-345). Specimens of ordinary cement mortar (OCM) and polymer cement mortar (PCM) were submerged for varying lengths of time (5, 9, 24, or 48 h), and water absorption (% by weight) was recorded. With mortar type as factor \(A\) (with two levels) and submersion period as factor \(B\) (with four levels), three observations were made for each factor level combination. Data included in the article was used to compute the sums of squares, which were SSA \(=\) 322.667, SSB \(=\) 35.623, SSAB \(=\) 8.557, and SST \(=\) 372.113. Use this information to construct an ANOVA table. Test the appropriate hypotheses at a.05 significance level.

Four plots were available for an experiment to compare clover accumulation for four different saving rates ("Performance of Overdrilled Red Clover with Different Sowing Rates and Initial Grazing Managements," _New Zeal. J. Exper. Agric._, 1984: 71-81). Since the four plots had been grazed differently prior to the experiment and it was thought that this might affect clover accumulation, a randomized block experiment was used with all four sowing rates tried on a section of each plot. Use the given data to test the null hypothesis of no difference in true mean clover accumulation (kg DM/ha) for the different sowing rates. **a.** Test to see if the different sowing rates make a difference in true mean clover accumulation. **b.** Make appropriate plots to go with your analysis in (a): Make a plot like the one in Figure 11.8, make a normal plot of the residuals, and plot the residuals against the predicted values. Explain why, based on the plots, the assumptions do not appear to be satisfied for this data set. **c.** Repeat part (a) replacing the observations with their natural logarithms. **d.** Repeat the plots of (b) for the analysis in (c). Do the logged observations appear to satisfy the assumptions better? **e.** Summarize your conclusions for this experiment. Does mean clover accumulation increase with increasing sowing rate?

Kutner, Michael, Christopher Nachtsheim, John Neter, and William Li, _Applied Linear Statistical Models_ (5th ed.), McGraw-Hill, New York, NY, 2005. The second half of this book contains a well-presentedsurvey of ANOVA; the level is comparable to that of the present text, but the discussion is more comprehensive, making the book an excellent reference Ott, R. Lyman, and Michael Longnecker, _An Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis_ (6th ed.), Cengage, Belmont, CA, 2010. Includes several chapters on ANOVA methodology that can profitably be read by students desiring a nonmathematical exposition; there is a good chapter on various multiple comparison methods

## Chapter 1 Introduction

The general objective of a regression analysis is to determine the relationship between two (or more) variables so that we can gain information about one of them through knowing values of the other(s). Much of mathematics is devoted to studying variables that are _deterministically_ related. Saying that \(x\) and \(y\) are related in this manner means that once we are told the value of \(x\), the value of \(y\) is completely specified. For example, suppose we decide to rent a van for a day and that the rental cost is $25.00 plus $.30 per mile driven. If we let \(x\) = the number of miles driven and \(y\) = the rental charge, then \(y\) = 25 +.3x. If we drive the van 100 miles (_x_ = 100), then \(y\) = 25 +.3(100) = 55. As another example, if the initial velocity of a particle is \(n\)0 and it undergoes constant acceleration \(a\), then distance traveled \(=y+v_{0}x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha x^{2}\), where \(x\) = time.

There are many variables \(x\) and \(y\) that would appear to be related to each other, but not in a deterministic fashion. A familiar example to many students is given by variables \(x\) = high school grade point average (GPA) and \(y\) = college GPA. The value of \(y\) cannot be determined just from knowledge of \(x\), and two different students could have the same \(x\) value but have very different \(y\) values. Yet there is a tendency for those students who have high (low) high school GPAs also to have high (low) college GPAs. Knowledge of a student's high school GPA should be quite helpful in enabling us to predict how that person will do in college.

Other examples of variables related in a nondeterministic fashion include \(x\) = age of a child and \(y\) = size of that child's vocabulary, \(x\) = size of an engine in cubic centimeters and \(y\) = fuel efficiency for an automobile equipped with that engine, and \(x\) = applied tensile force and \(y\) = amount of elongation in a metal strip.

Regression analysis is the part of statistics that deals with investigation of the relationship between two or more variables related in a nondeterministic fashion.

In this chapter, we generalize a deterministic linear relation to obtain a linear probabilistic model for relating two variables \(x\) and \(y\). We then develop procedures for making inferences based on data obtained from the model, and obtain a quantitative measure (the correlation coefficient) of the extent to which the two variables are related. Techniques for assessing the adequacy of any particular regression model are then considered. We next introduce multiple regression analysis as a way of relating \(y\) to two or more variables--for example, relating fuel efficiency of an automobile to weight, engine size, number of cylinders, and transmission type. The last section of the chapter shows how matrix algebra techniques can be used to facilitate a concise and elegant development of regression procedures.

## 12 The Simple Linear and Logistic Regression Models

The key idea in developing a probabilistic relationship between a **dependent** or **response** variable \(y\) and an **independent, explanatory**, or **predictor** variable \(x\) is to realize that once the value of \(x\) has been fixed, there is still uncertainty in what the resulting \(y\) value will be. That is, for a fixed value of \(x\), we now think of the dependent variable as being random. This random variable will be denoted by \(Y\) and its observed value by \(y\). For example, suppose an investigator plans a study to relate \(y\) = yearly energy usage of an industrial building (1000's of BTUs) to \(x\) = the shell area of the building (ft2). If one of the buildings selected for the study has a shell area of 25,000 ft2, the resulting energy usage might be 2,215,000 or it might be 2,348,000 or any one of a number of other possibilities. Since we don't know a priori what the value of energy usage will be (because usage is determined partly by factors other than shell area), usage is regarded as a random variable \(Y\).

We now relate the independent and dependent variables by an **additive model equation**:

\[\begin{array}{l} {Y = \text{some particular deterministic function of }x + \text{a random deviation}} \\ {= f(x) + \varepsilon } \\ \end{array}\]

The symbol \(e\) represents a random deviation or random "error" (random variable) which is assumed to have mean value 0. This rv incorporates all variation in the dependent variable due to factors other than \(x\). Figure 12.1 shows the graph of a particular _f_(_x_). Without the random deviation \(e\), whenever \(x\) is fixed prior to making an observation on the dependent variable, the resulting (_x_, _y_) point would fall exactly on the graph. That is, \(y\) would be entirely determined by \(x\). The role of the random deviation \(e\) is to allow a non-deterministic relationship. Now if the value of \(e\) is positive, the resulting (_x_, _y_) point falls above the graph of _f_(_x_), whereas when \(e\) is negative, the resulting point falls below the graph. The assumption that \(e\) has mean value 0 implies that we _expect_ the point (_x_, _y_) to fall right on the graph, but we virtually never see what we literally expect--the observed point will almost always deviate upward or downward from the graph.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:628]

(histograms or boxplots are alternative options). Here are some things to notice about the data and plot:

* Several observations have identical \(x\) values yet different \(y\) values (e.g., \(x_{8}=x_{9}=.75\), but \(y_{8}=1.80\) and \(y_{9}=1.74\)). Thus the value of \(y\) is _not_ determined solely by \(x\) but also by various other factors.
* There is a strong tendency for \(y\) to increase as \(x\) increases. That is, larger values of OSA tend to be associated with larger values of fissure width--a positive relationship between the variables.
* It appears that the value of \(y\) could be predicted from \(x\) by finding a line that is reasonably close to the points in the plot (the authors of the cited article superimposed such a line on their plot). In other words, there is evidence of a substantial (though not perfect) linear relationship between the two variables.

The horizontal and vertical axes in the scatter plot of Figure 12.2 intersect at the point (0, 0). In many data sets, the values of \(x\) or \(y\) or the values of both variables differ considerably from zero relative to the range(s) of the values. For example, a study of how air conditioner efficiency is related to maximum daily outdoor temperature might involve observations for temperatures ranging from 80\({}^{\circ}\)F to 100\({}^{\circ}\)F. When this is the case, a more informative plot would show the appropriately labeled axes intersecting at some point other than (0, 0).

Forest growth and decline phenomena throughout the world have attracted considerable public and scientific interest. The article "Relationships Among Crown Condition, Growth, and Stand Nutrition in Seven Northern Vermont Sugarbushes" (_Canad. J. Forest Res._, 1995: 386-397) included a scatter plot of \(y=\) mean crown dieback (%), one indicator of growth retardation, and \(x=\) soil pH (higher pH corresponds to more acidic soil), from which the following observations were taken:

\[\begin{array}{l|cccccccccccc}x&3.3&3.4&3.4&3.5&3.6&3.6&3.7&3.7&3.8&3.8\\ y&7.3&10.8&13.1&10.4&5.8&9.3&12.4&14.9&11.2&8.0\\ x&3.9&4.0&4.1&4.2&4.3&4.4&4.5&5.0&5.1\\ \hline y&6.6&10.0&9.2&12.4&2.3&4.3&3.0&1.6&1.0\\ \end{array}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11890]

The random deviation (random variable) \(\varepsilon\) is assumed to be normally distributed with mean value 0 and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), and this mean value and variance are the same regardless of the fixed \(x\) value. The \(n\) observed pairs (\(x_{1}\), \(y_{1}\)), (\(x_{2}\), \(y_{2}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(x_{n}\), \(y_{n}\)) are regarded as having been generated independently of each other from the model equation (first fix \(x=x_{1}\) and observe \(Y_{1}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\varepsilon_{1}\), then fix \(x=x_{2}\) and observe \(Y_{2}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{2}+\varepsilon_{2}\), and so on; assuming that the \(\varepsilon\)'s are independent of each other implies that the \(Y\)'s are also).

The first two model parameters \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) are the coefficients of the **population** or **true regression line**\(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\). The slope parameter \(\beta_{1}\) is now interpreted as the _expected_ or _true average_ increase in \(Y\) associated with a 1-unit increase in \(x\). The variance parameter \(\sigma^{2}\) (or equivalently the standard deviation \(\sigma\)) controls the inherent amount of variability in the data. When \(\sigma^{2}\) is very close to 0, virtually all of the (\(x_{i}\), \(y_{i}\)) pairs in the sample should correspond to points quite close to the population regression line. But if \(\sigma^{2}\) greatly exceeds 0, a number of points in the scatter plot should fall far from the line. So the larger the value of \(\sigma\), the greater will be the tendency for observed points to deviate from the population line by substantial amounts. Roughly speaking, the magnitude of \(\sigma\) is the size of a "typical" deviation from the population line.

The following notation will help clarify implications of the model relationship. Let \(x\)* denote a particular value of the independent variable \(x\), and

\[\mu_{Y,x^{*}} = \text{the expected }(\text{i.e.},\text{ mean})\text{ value of }Y\text{ when }x=x^{*}\] \[\sigma^{2}_{Y,x^{*}} = \text{the variance of }Y\text{ when }x=x^{*}\]

Alternative notation for these quantities is \(E(\mathbb{Y}|x\)*) and \(V(\mathbb{Y}|x\)*). For example, if \(x=\) applied stress (kg/mm\({}^{2}\)) and \(y=\) time to fracture (h), then \(\mu_{Y:20}\) denotes the expected time to fracture when applied stress is 20 kg/mm\({}^{2}\). If we conceptualize an entire population of (\(x\), \(y\)) pairs resulting from applying stress to specimens, then \(\mu_{Y:20}\) is the average of all values of the dependent variable for which \(x=\) 20. The variance \(\sigma^{2}_{Y:20}\) describes the spread in the distribution of all \(y\) values for which applied stress is 20.

Figure 4: Points corresponding to observations from the simple linear regression model

Now consider replacing \(x\) in the model equation by the fixed value \(x\)*. Then the only randomness on the right-hand side is from the random deviation \(\varepsilon\). Recalling that the mean value of a numerical constant is the numerical constant and the variance of a constant is zero, we have that

\[\mu_{Y,x^{*}} =E(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}+\varepsilon)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*} +E(\varepsilon)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\] \[\sigma_{Y,x^{*}}^{2} =V(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}+\varepsilon)=V(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{ *})+V(\varepsilon)=0+\sigma^{2}=\sigma^{2}\]

The first sequence of equalities says that the mean value of \(Y\) when \(x=x\)* is the height of the population regression line above the value \(x\)*. That is, _the population regression line is the line of mean \(Y\) values_--the _mean \(Y\)_ value is a linear function of the independent variable. The second sequence of equalities tells us that the amount of variability in the distribution of \(Y\) is the same at any particular \(x\) value as it is at any other \(x\) value--this is the property of homogeneous variation about the population regression line. If the independent variable is age of a preschool child and the dependent variable is the child's vocabulary size, data suggests that the mean vocabulary size increases linearly with age. However, there is more variability in vocabulary size for 2-year-old children than for 4-year-old children, so there is not constant variation in \(Y\) about the population line and the simple linear regression model is therefore not appropriate. The constant variance property implies that points should spread out about the population regression line to the same extent throughout the range of \(x\) values in the sample, rather than fanning out more as \(x\) increases or as \(x\) decreases.

Also, the sum of a constant and a normally distributed variable is itself normally distributed, and the addition of the constant affects only the mean value and not the variance. So for any fixed value \(x\)*, \(Y\) ( = \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\)* + \(\varepsilon\)) has a normal distribution. The foregoing properties are summarized in Figure 12.5.

Suppose the relationship between applied stress \(x\) and time-to-failure \(y\) is described by the simple linear regression model with true regression line \(y=65-1.2x\) and \(\sigma=8\). Then on average there is a 1.2-h decrease in time to rupture associated with

Figure 12.5: (a) Distribution of \(\varepsilon\), (b) distribution of \(Y\) for different values of \(x\)

an increase of 1 kg/mm\({}^{2}\) in applied stress. For any fixed value of \(x\)* of stress, time to rupture is normally distributed with mean value \(65\ -\ 1.2x\)* and standard deviation 8. Roughly speaking, in the population consisting of all \((x,y)\) points, the magnitude of a typical deviation from the true regression line is about 8. For \(x=20\), \(Y\) has mean value \(\mu_{Y\cdot 20}=65\ -\ 1.2(20)=41\), so

\[P(Y>50\ \text{when}\ x=20)=P\bigg{(}Z>\frac{50-41}{8}\bigg{)}=1-\Phi(1.13)=.1292\]

When applied stress is 25, \(\mu_{Y\cdot 25}=35\), so the probability that time-to-failure exceeds 50 is

\[P(Y>50\ \text{when}\ x=25)=P\bigg{(}Z>\frac{50-35}{8}\bigg{)}=1-\Phi(1.88)=.0301\]

These probabilities are illustrated as the shaded areas in Figure 12.6.

Suppose that \(Y_{1}\) denotes an observation on time-to-failure made with \(x=25\) and \(Y_{2}\) denotes an independent observation made with \(x=24\). Then the difference \(Y_{1}-Y_{2}\) is normally distributed with mean value \(E(Y_{1}-Y_{2})=\beta_{1}=-1.2\), variance \(V(Y_{1}-Y_{2})=\sigma^{2}+\sigma^{2}=128\), and standard deviation \(\sqrt{128}=11.314\). The probability that \(Y_{1}\) exceeds \(Y_{2}\) is

\[P(Y_{1}-Y_{2}>0)=P\bigg{(}Z>\frac{0-(-1.2)}{11.314}\bigg{)}=P(Z>.11)=.4562\]

That is, even though we expected \(Y\) to decrease when \(x\) increases by 1 unit, the probability is fairly high (but less than.5) that the observed \(Y\) at \(x+1\) will be larger than the observed \(Y\) at \(x\). 

## The Logistic Regression Model

The simple linear regression model is appropriate for relating a quantitative response variable \(y\) to a quantitative predictor \(x\). Suppose that \(y\) is a dichotomous variable with possible values 1 and 0 corresponding to success and failure.

Figure 12.6: Probabilities based on the simple linear regression model

Let \(p=P(S)=P(y=1)\). Frequently, the value of \(p\) will depend on the value of some quantitative variable \(x\). For example, the probability that a car needs warranty service of a certain kind might well depend on the car's mileage, or the probability of avoiding an infection of a certain type might depend on the dosage in an inoculation. Instead of using just the symbol \(p\) for the success probability, we now use \(p(x)\) to emphasize the dependence of this probability on the value of \(x\). The simple linear regression equation \(Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x+\varepsilon\) is no longer appropriate, for taking the mean value on each side of the equation gives

\[\mu_{Y\cdot x}=1\cdot p(x)+0\cdot[1-p(x)]=p(x)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\]

Whereas \(p(x)\) is a probability and therefore must be between 0 and 1, \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\) need not be in this range.

Instead of letting the mean value of \(y\) be a linear function of \(x\), we now consider a model in which some function of the mean value of \(y\) is a linear function of \(x\). In other words, we allow \(p(x)\) to be a function of \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\) rather than \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\) itself. A function that has been found quite useful in many applications is the **logit function**

\[p(x)=\frac{e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x}}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x}}\]

Figure 12.7 shows a graph of \(p(x)\) for particular values of \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) with \(\beta_{1}>0\). As \(x\) increases, the probability of success increases. For \(\beta_{1}\) negative, the success probability would be a decreasing function of \(x\).

_Logistic regression_ means assuming that \(p(x)\) is related to \(x\) by the logit function. Straightforward algebra shows that

\[\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}=e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x}\]

The expression on the left-hand side is called the _odds ratio_. If, for example \(p(60)=3/4\), then \(p(60)/[1-p(60)]=\frac{3}{4}/\left[1-\frac{3}{4}\right]=3\) and when \(x=60\) a success

Figure 12.7: A graph of a logit function

is three times as likely as a failure. This is described by saying that the odds are 3 to 1 because the success probability is three times the failure probability. Taking natural logs of both sides, we see that the logarithm of the odds ratio is a linear function of the predictor, \[\ln\left(\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)}\right)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\] In particular, the slope parameter \(\beta_{1}\) is the change in the log odds associated with a 1-unit increase in \(x\). This implies that the odds ratio itself changes by the multiplicative factor \(e^{\beta_{1}}\) when \(x\) increases by 1 unit.

It seems reasonable that the size of a cancerous tumor should be related to the likelihood that the cancer will spread (metastasize) to another site. The article "Molecular Detection of p16 Promoter Methylation in the Serum of Patients with Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma" (_Cancer Res._, 2001: 3135-3138) investigated the spread of esophageal cancer to the lymph nodes. With \(x=\) size of a tumor (cm) and \(Y=1\) if the cancer does spread, consider the logistic regression model with \(\beta_{1}=.5\) and \(\beta_{0}=-2\) (values suggested by data in the article). Then

\[p(x)=\frac{e^{-2+.5x}}{1+e^{-2+.5x}}\] from which \(p(2)=.27\) and \(p(8)=.88\) (tumor sizes for patients in the study ranged from 1.7 to 9.0 cm). Because \(e^{-2+.5(6.77)}\approx 4\), the odds for a 6.77 cm tumor are 4, so that it is four times as likely as not that a tumor of this size will spread to the lymph nodes. \(\blacksquare\)

The efficiency ratio for a steel specimen immersed in a phosphating tank is the weight of the phosphate coating divided by the metal loss (both in mg/ft2).

Consider the scatter plot of \(x =\) racket resonance frequency (Hz) and \(y =\) sum of peak-to-peak acceleration (a characteristic of arm vibration, in m/s/s) for \(n = 23\) different rackets ("Transfer of Tennis Racket Vibrations into the Human Forearm," _Med.

## 12.2 Estimating Model Parameters

We will assume in this and the next several sections that the variables \(x\) and \(y\) are related according to the simple linear regression model. The values of \(b\)0, \(b\)1, and \(s\)2 will almost never be known to an investigator. Instead, sample data consisting of \(n\) observed pairs (_x_1, \(y\)1),..., (_x_m, \(y_{n}\)) will be available, from which the model parameters and the true regression line itself can be estimated. These observationsare assumed to have been obtained independently of each other. That is, \(y_{i}\) is the observed value of an rv \(Y_{i}\), where \(Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}\) and the \(n\) deviations \(\varepsilon_{1}\), \(\varepsilon_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\varepsilon_{n}\) are independent rv's. Independence of \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{n}\) follows from the independence of the \(\varepsilon_{i}\)'s.

According to the model, the observed points will be distributed about the true regression line in a random manner. Figure 12.8 shows a typical plot of observed pairs along with two candidates for the estimated regression line, \(y=a_{0}+a_{1}x\) and \(y=b_{0}+b_{1}x\). Intuitively, the line \(y=a_{0}+a_{1}x\) is not a reasonable estimate of the true line \(y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\) because, if \(y=a_{0}+a_{1}x\) were the true line, the observed points would almost surely have been closer to this line. The line \(y=b_{0}+b_{1}x\) is a more plausible estimate because the observed points are scattered rather closely about this line.

Figure 12.8 and the foregoing discussion suggest that our estimate of \(y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\) should be a line that provides in some sense a best fit to the observed data points. This is what motivates the principle of least squares, which can be traced back to the mathematicians Gauss and Legendre around the year 1800. According to this principle, a line provides a good fit to the data if the vertical distances (deviations) from the observed points to the line are small (see Figure 12.9). The measure of the goodness-of-fit is the sum of the squares of these deviations. The best-fit line is then the one having the smallest possible sum of squared deviations.

Figure 12.8: Two different estimates of the true regression line

Figure 12.9: Deviations of observed data from line \(y=b_{0}+b_{1}x\)

The initial values of \(b_{0}\) and \(b_{1}\) are found by taking partial derivatives of \(f(b_{0},b_{1})\) with respect to both \(b_{0}\) and \(b_{1}\), equating them both to zero [analogously to \(f^{\prime}(b)=0\) in univariate calculus], and solving the equations

\[\frac{\partial f(b_{0},b_{1})}{\partial b_{0}} = \sum 2(y_{i}-b_{0}-b_{1}x_{i})(-1) = 0\] \[\frac{\partial f(b_{0},b_{1})}{\partial b_{1}} = \sum 2(y_{i}-b_{0}-b_{1}x_{i})(-x_{i}) = 0\]

Cancellation of the factor 2 and rearrangement gives the following system of equations, called the **normal equations**:

\[nb_{0}+\left(\sum x_{i}\right)b_{1} = \sum y_{i}\] \[\left(\sum x_{i}\right)b_{0}+\left(\sum x_{i}^{2}\right)b_{1} = \sum x_{i}y_{i}\]

The normal equations are linear in the two unknowns \(b_{0}\) and \(b_{1}\). Provided that at least two of the \(x_{i}\)'s are different, the least squares estimates are the unique solution to this system.

The least squares estimate of the slope coefficient \(\beta_{1}\) of the true regression line is

\[b_{1}=\hat{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)\left(y_{i}- \overline{y}\right)}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}=\frac{S_{xy}}{S _{xx}} \tag{2}\]

Computing formulas for the numerator and denominator of \(b_{1}\) are

\[S_{xy}=\sum x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{\left(\sum x_{i}\right)\left(\sum y_{i}\right)}{ n}\qquad S_{xx}=\sum x_{i}^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum x_{i}\right)^{2}}{n}\](the \(S_{xx}\) formula was derived in Chapter 1 in connection with the sample variance, and the derivation of the \(S_{xy}\) formula is similar).

The least squares estimate of the intercept \(b_{0}\) of the true regression line is

\[b_{0}=\hat{\beta}_{0}=\frac{\sum y_{i}-\hat{\beta}_{1}\sum x_{i}}{n}=\overline{ y}-\hat{\beta}_{1}\overline{x} \tag{12.3}\]

Because of the normality assumption, \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) are also the maximum likelihood estimates (see Exercise 23).

The computational formulas for \(S_{xy}\) and \(S_{xx}\) require only the summary statistics \(\Sigma x_{i}\), \(\Sigma y_{i}\), \(\Sigma x_{i}^{2},\Sigma x_{i}y_{i}\) (\(\Sigma y_{i}^{2}\) will be needed shortly); the \(x\) and \(y\) deviations are then not needed. In computing \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\), use extra digits in \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) because, if \(\overline{x}\) is large in magnitude, rounding may affect the final answer. We emphasize that _before \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) are computed_, _a scatter plot should be examined to see whether a linear probabilistic model is plausible_. If the points do not tend to cluster about a straight line with roughly the same degree of spread for all \(x\), other models should be investigated. In practice, plots and regression calculations are usually done by using a statistical computer package.

Global warming is a major issue, and CO\({}_{2}\) emissions are an important part of the discussion. What is the effect of increased CO\({}_{2}\) levels on the environment? In particular, what is the effect of these higher levels on the growth of plants and trees? The article "Effects of Atmospheric CO\({}_{2}\) Enrichment on Biomass Accumulation and Distribution in Eldarica Pine Trees" (\(J.\)_Exp. Bot._, 1994: 345-349) describes the results of growing pine trees with increasing levels of CO\({}_{2}\) in the air. There were two trees at each of four levels of CO\({}_{2}\) concentration, and the mass of each tree was measured after 11 months of the experiment. Here are the observations with \(x=\) atmospheric concentration of CO\({}_{2}\) in microliters per liter (parts per million) and \(y=\) mass in kilograms, along with \(x^{2}\), \(xy\) and \(y^{2}\). The mass measurements were read from a graph in the article.

Thus \(\overline{x}=4908/8=613.5\), \(\overline{y}=22.7/8=2.838\), and \[\hat{\beta}_{1} =\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}=\frac{15,441.4-(4908)(22.7)/8}{3,190,248-(490 8)^{2}/8}\] \[=\frac{1514.95}{179,190}=.00845443\approx.00845\] \[\hat{\beta}_{0} =2.838-(.00845443)(613.5)=-2.349\] We estimate that the expected change in tree mass associated with a 1-part-per-million increase in CO\({}_{2}\) concentration is.00845. The equation of the estimated regression line (least squares line) is then \(y=-2.35+.00845x\). Figure 12.10, generated by the statistical computer package R, shows that the least squares line provides an excellent summary of the relationship between the two variables.

The estimated regression line can immediately be used for two different purposes. For a fixed \(x\) value \(x^{*}\), \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) (the height of the line above \(x^{*}\)) gives either (1) a point estimate of the expected value of \(Y\) when \(x=x^{*}\) or (2) a point prediction of the \(Y\) value that will result from a single new observation made at \(x=x^{*}\).

The least squares line should not be used to make a prediction for an \(x\) value much beyond the range of the data, such as \(x=250\) or \(x=1000\) in Example 12.5. The **danger of extrapolation** is that the fitted relationship (a line here) may not be valid for such \(x\) values. (In the foregoing example, \(x=250\) gives \(\hat{y}=-.235\), a patently ridiculous value of mass, but extrapolation will not always result in such inconsistencies.)

Refer to the tree-mass-CO\({}_{2}\) data in the previous example. With a little extrapolation, a point estimate for true average mass for all specimens with CO\({}_{2}\) concentration 365 is

\[\hat{\mu}_{Y\cdot 365}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}(365)=-2.35+.00845(36 5)=.73\]

With a little more extrapolation, a point estimate for true average mass for all specimens with CO\({}_{2}\) concentration 315 is

\[\hat{\mu}_{Y\cdot 315}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}(315)=-2.35+.00845(31 5)=.31\]

Figure 12.10: A scatter plot of the data in Example 12.5 with the least squares line superimposed, from R

The values 315 and 365 are chosen based on actual values: the average world atmospheric CO2 concentration rose from 315 to 365 parts per million between 1960 and 2000. Even if the prediction equation is somewhat inaccurate when extrapolated to the left, it is clear that changes in carbon dioxide are making a big difference in the growth of trees. Notice that in Figure 12.10 the tree mass increases by a factor of more than 4 while the CO2 concentration increases by just a factor of 2. 

### Estimating \(\sigma^{2}\) and \(\sigma\)

The parameter \(\sigma^{2}\) determines the amount of variability inherent in the regression model. A large value of \(\sigma^{2}\) will lead to observed (\(x_{i}\), \(y_{i}\))'s that are quite spread out about the true regression line, whereas when \(\sigma^{2}\) is small the observed points will tend to fall very close to the true line (see Figure 12.11). An estimate of \(\sigma^{2}\) will be used in confidence interval (CI) formulas and hypothesis-testing procedures presented in the next two sections. Because the equation of the true line is unknown, the estimate is based on the extent to which the sample observations deviate from the estimated line. Many large deviations (residuals) suggest a large value of \(\sigma^{2}\), whereas if all deviations are small in magnitude it indicates that \(\sigma^{2}\) is small.

In words, the predicted value \(\hat{y}_{i}\) is the value of \(y\) that we would predict or expect when using the estimated regression line with \(x=x_{i}\); \(\hat{y}_{i}\) is the height of the estimated regression line above the value \(x_{i}\) for which the \(i\)th observation was made. The residual \(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\) is the difference between the observed \(y_{i}\) and the predicted \(\hat{y}_{i}\). If the residuals are all small in magnitude, then much of the variability

Figure 12.11: Typical sample for \(\sigma^{2}\): (a) small; (b) large

in observed \(y\) values appears to be due to the linear relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), whereas many large residuals suggest quite a bit of inherent variability in \(y\) relative to the amount due to the linear relation. Assuming that the line in Figure 12.9 is the least squares line, the residuals are identified by the vertical line segments from the observed points to the line. When the estimated regression line is obtained via the principle of least squares, the sum of the residuals should in theory be zero (an immediate consequence of the first normal equation; see Exercise 24). In practice, the sum may deviate a bit from zero due to rounding.

Japan's high population density has resulted in a multitude of resource usage problems. One especially serious difficulty concerns waste removal. The article "Innovative Sludge Handling Through Pelletization Thickening" (_Water Res._, 1999: 3245-3252) reported the development of a new compression machine for processing sewage sludge. An important part of the investigation involved relating the moisture content of compressed pellets (\(y\), in %) to the machine's filtration rate (\(x\), in kg-DS/m/h). The following data was read from a graph in the paper:

\[\begin{array}{l|rrrrrrrrrr}x&125.3&98.2&201.4&147.3&145.9&124.7&112.2&120.2&1 61.2&178.9\\ \hline y&77.9&76.8&81.5&79.8&78.2&78.3&77.5&77.0&80.1&80.2\\ x&159.5&145.8&75.1&151.4&144.2&125.0&198.8&132.5&159.6&110.7\\ \hline y&79.9&79.0&76.7&78.2&79.5&78.1&81.5&77.0&79.0&78.6\\ \end{array}\]

Relevant summary quantities (_summary statistics_) are \(\sum x_{i}=2817.9\), \(\sum y_{i}=1574.8\), \(\sum x_{i}^{2}=415,949.85\), \(\sum x_{i}y_{i}=222,657.88\), and \(\sum y_{i}^{2}=124,039.58\), from which \(\overline{x}=140.895\), \(\overline{y}=78.74\), \(S_{xx}=18,921.8295\), and \(S_{xy}=776.434\). Thus

\[\hat{\beta}_{1}= \frac{776.434}{18,921.8295}=.04103377\approx.041\] \[\hat{\beta}_{0}= 78.74-(.04103377)(140.895)=72.958547\approx 72.96\]

from which the equation of the least squares line is \(\hat{y}=72.96+.041x\). For numerical accuracy, the fitted values are calculated from \(\hat{y}_{i}=72.958547+.04103377x_{i}\):

\[\hat{y}_{1}=72.958547+.04103377(125.3)\approx 78.100\quad y_{1}-\hat{y}_{1} \approx-200,\ \text{etc.}\]

A positive residual corresponds to a point in the scatter plot that lies above the graph of the least squares line, whereas a negative residual results from a point lying below the line. All predicted values (fits) and residuals appear in the accompanying table.

In much the same way that the deviations from the mean in a one-sample situation were combined to obtain the estimate \(s^{2} = \sum\left(x_{i} - \overline{x} \right)^{2}/(n - 1)\), the estimate of \(s^{2}\) in regression analysis is based on squaring and summing the residuals. We will continue to use the symbol \(s^{2}\) for this estimated variance, so don't confuse it with our previous \(s^{2}\).

The **error sum of squares** (equivalently, residual sum of squares), denoted by SSE, is

\[\text{SSE} = \sum\left(y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i} \right)^{2} = \sum\left[ \,y_{i} - (\hat{\theta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i} ) \right]^{2}\]

and the least squares estimate of \(\sigma^{2}\) is

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2} = s^{2} = \frac{\text{SSE}}{n - 2} = \frac{\sum\left(y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i} \right)^{2}}{n - 2}\]

The divisor \(n - 2\) in \(s^{2}\) is the number of degrees of freedom (df) associated with the estimate (or, equivalently, with the error sum of squares). This is because to obtain \(s^{2}\), the two parameters \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) must first be estimated, which results in a loss of 2 df (just as \(\mu\) had to be estimated in one-sample problems, resulting in an estimated variance based on \(n - 1\) df). Replacing each \(y_{i}\) in the formula for \(s^{2}\) by the rv \(Y_{i}\) gives the estimator \(S^{2}\). It can be shown that \(S^{2}\) is an unbiased estimator for \(\sigma^{2}\) (although the estimator \(S\) is biased for \(\sigma\)). The mle of \(\sigma^{2}\) has divisor \(n\) rather than \(n - 2\), so it is biased.

The residuals for the filtration rate-moisture content data were calculated previously. The corresponding error sum of squares is

\[\text{SSE} = \left( -.200 \right)^{2} + \left( -.188 \right)^{2} + \cdots + \left( 1.099 \right)^{2} = 7.968\]

The estimate of \(\sigma^{2}\) is then \(\hat{\sigma}^{2} = s^{2} = 7.968/(20 - 2) =.4427\), and the estimated standard deviation is \(\hat{\sigma} = s = \sqrt{.4427} =.665\). Roughly speaking,.665 is the magnitude of a typical deviation from the estimated regression line.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:645]

the fact that \(x\) and \(y\) are linearly related in combination with variation in \(x\). The points in Figure 12.12b do not fall exactly on a line, but compared to overall \(y\) variability, the deviations from the least squares line are small. It is reasonable to conclude in this case that much of the observed \(y\) variation can be attributed to the approximate linear relationship between the variables postulated by the simple linear regression model. When the scatter plot looks like that of Figure 12.12c, there is substantial variation about the least squares line relative to overall \(y\) variation, so the simple linear regression model fails to explain variation in \(y\) by relating \(y\) to \(x\).

The error sum of squares SSE can be interpreted as a measure of how much variation in \(y\) is left unexplained by the model--that is, how much cannot be attributed to a linear relationship. In Figure 12.12a, SSE = 0, and there is no unexplained variation, whereas unexplained variation is small for the data of Figure 12.12b and much larger in Figure 12.12c. A quantitative measure of the total amount of variation in observed \(y\) values is given by the **total sum of squares**

\[\text{SST}=S_{yy}=\sum{(y_{i}-\overline{y})^{2}}=\sum{y_{i}^{2}}-{(\sum y_{i} )^{2}}/n\]

The total sum of squares is the sum of squared deviations about the sample mean of the observed \(y\) values. Thus the same number \(\overline{y}\) is subtracted from each \(y_{i}\) in SST, whereas SSE involves subtracting each different predicted value \(\hat{y}_{i}\) from the corresponding observed \(y_{i}\). Just as SSE is the sum of squared deviations about the least squares line \(y=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x\), SST is the sum of squared deviations about the horizontal line at height \(\overline{y}\) (since then vertical deviations are \(y_{i}-\overline{y}\)), as pictured in Figure 12.13. Furthermore, because the sum of squared deviations about the least squares line is smaller than the sum of squared deviations about _any_ other line, SSE \(<\) SST unless the horizontal line is the least squares line. The ratio SSE/SST is the proportion of total variation that cannot be explained by the simple linear regression model, and \(1-\) SSE/SST (a number between 0 and 1) is the proportion of observed \(y\) variation explained by the model.

Figure 12: Explaining \(y\) variation: (a) all variation explained; (b) most variation explained; (c) little variation explained

In equivalent words, \(r^{2}\) is the proportion by which the error sum of squares is reduced by the regression line compared to the horizontal line. For example, if \(\text{SST}=20\) and \(\text{SSE}=2\), then \(r^{2}=1-\frac{2}{20}\), so the regression reduces the error sum of squares by \(.90=90\%\).

The higher the value of \(r^{2}\), the more successful is the simple linear regression model in explaining \(y\) variation. When regression analysis is done by a statistical computer package, either \(r^{2}\) or \(100r^{2}\) (the percentage of variation explained by the model) is a prominent part of the output. If \(r^{2}\) is small, an analyst may want to search for an alternative model (either a nonlinear model or a multiple regression model that involves more than a single independent variable) that can more effectively explain \(y\) variation.

The scatter plot of the CO\({}_{2}\) concentration data in Figure 12.10 indicates a fairly high \(r^{2}\) value. With

\[\hat{\beta}_{0}=-2.349293\qquad\hat{\beta}_{1}=.00845443\qquad\Sigma y_{i}=22.7\]

\[\Sigma x_{i}y_{i}=15,441.4\qquad\Sigma y_{i}^{2}=78.93\]

we have

\[\text{SST}= 78.93-\frac{22.7^{2}}{8}=14.519\] \[\text{SSE}= 78.93-(-2.349293)(22.7)-(.00845443)(15,441.4)=1.711\]

Figure 12.13: Sums of squares illustrated: (a) \(\text{SSE}=\text{sum of squared deviations about the least squares line; (b) \text{SST}=\text{sum of squared deviations about the horizontal line}}\)

The coefficient of determination is then

\[r^{2}=1-\frac{1.711}{14.519}=1-.118=.882\]

That is, 88.2% of the observed variation in mass is attributable to (can be explained by) the approximate linear relationship between mass and CO\({}_{2}\) concentration, a fairly impressive result. The \(r^{2}\) can also be interpreted by saying that the error sum of squares using the regression line is 88.2% less than the error sum of squares using a horizontal line. By the way, although it is common to have \(r^{2}\) values of.88 or more in engineering, the physical sciences, and the biological sciences, \(r^{2}\) is likely to be much smaller in social sciences such as psychology and sociology. An \(r^{2}\) as big as.5 would be unusual in predicting one test score from another. In particular, when third grade verbal IQ score is used to predict third-grade written IQ score for the 33 students of Example 1.2, \(r^{2}\) is only.28.

Figure 12.14 shows partial MINITAB output for the CO\({}_{2}\) concentration data of Examples 12.5 and 12.10; the package will also provide the predicted values and residuals upon request, as well as other information. The formats used by other packages differ slightly from that of MINITAB, but the information content is very similar. Quantities such as the standard deviations, \(t\)-ratios, and the details of the ANOVA table are discussed in Section 12.3.

For regression there is an analysis of variance identity like the fundamental identity (11.1), in Section 11.1. Add and subtract \(\hat{y}_{i}\) in the total sum of squares:

\[\text{SST}=\sum\left(y_{i}-\overline{y}\right)^{2}=\sum\left[\left(y_{i}-\hat {y}_{i}\right)+\left(\hat{y}_{i}-\overline{y}\right)\right]^{2}=\sum\left(y_{ i}-\hat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}+\sum\left(\hat{y}_{i}-\overline{y}\right)^{2}\]

Notice that the middle (cross-product) term is missing on the right, but see Exercise 24 for the justification. Of the two sums on the right, the first is \(\text{SSE}=\sum\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}\)

Figure 12.14: MINITAB output for the regression of Examples 12.5 and 12.10

and the second is something new, the **regression sum of squares**, \(\text{SSR}=\sum\left(\hat{y}_{i}-\overline{y}\right)^{2}\). Interpret the regression sum of squares as the amount of total variation that _is_ explained by the model. The analysis of variance identity for regression is

\[\text{SST}=\text{SSE}+\text{SSR} \tag{12.4}\]

The coefficient of determination in Example 12.10 can now be written in a slightly different way:

\[r^{2}=1-\frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}}=\frac{\text{SST}-\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}} =\frac{\text{SSR}}{\text{SST}}\]

the ratio of explained variation to total variation. The ANOVA table in Figure 12.14 shows that \(\text{SSR}=12.808\), from which \(r^{2}=12.808/14.519=.882\).

### Terminology and Scope of Regression Analysis

The term _regression analysis_ was first used by Francis Galton in the late nineteenth century in connection with his work on the relationship between father's height \(x\) and son's height \(y\). After collecting a number of pairs \((x_{i},y_{i})\), Galton used the principle of least squares to obtain the equation of the estimated regression line with the objective of using it to predict son's height from father's height. In using the derived line, Galton found that if a father was above average in height, the son would also be expected to be above average in height, _but not by as much as the father was_. Similarly, the son of a shorter-than-average father would also be expected to be shorter than average, but not by as much as the father. Thus the predicted height of a son was "pulled back in" toward the mean; because _regression_ can be defined as moving backward, Galton adopted the terminology _regression line_. This phenomenon of being pulled back in toward the mean has been observed in many other situations (e.g., batting averages from year to year in baseball) and is called the **regression effect** or **regression to the mean**. See also Section 5.3 for a discussion of this topic in the context of the bivariate normal distribution.

Because of the regression effect, care must be exercised in experiments that involve selecting individuals based on below average scores. For example, if students are selected because of below average performance on a test, and they are then given special instruction, then the regression effect predicts improvement even if the instruction is useless. A similar warning applies in studies of under-performing businesses or hospital patients.

Our discussion thus far has presumed that the independent variable is under the control of the investigator, so that only the dependent variable \(Y\) is random. This was not, however, the case with Galton's experiment; fathers' heights were not preselected, but instead both \(X\) and \(Y\) were random. Methods and conclusions of regression analysis can be applied both when the values of the independent variable are fixed in advance and when they are random, but because the derivations and interpretations are more straightforward in the former case, we will continue to work explicitly with it. For more commentary, see the excellent book by Michael Kutner et al. listed in the chapter bibliography.

The data, for ten streets with bike lanes, follows: \[x \text{, }12.8\text{, }12.9\text{, }12.9\text{, }13.6\text{, }14.5\] \[y \text{, }5.5\text{, }6.2\text{, }6.3\text{, }7.0\text{, }7.8\text{, }\sum y_{i}^{2} = 675.16\text{, }\] \[x \text{, }14.6\text{, }15.1\text{, }17.5\text{, }19.5\text{, }20.8\text{. }\] \[y \text{, }8.3\text{, }7.1\text{, }10.0\text{, }10.8\text{, }11.0\text{. }\] 1. Verify that \(\sum x_{i} = 154.20\text{, }\sum y_{i} = 80\text{, }\sum x_{i}^{2} = 2452.18\text{, }\)\(\sum x_{i}y_{i} = 1282.74\text{, }\) and \(\sum y_{i}^{2} = 675.16\text{. }\) 2. Derive the equation of the estimated regression line. 3. What separation distance would you predict for another street that has 15.0 as its available travel space value? 4. What would be the estimate of expected separation distance for all streets having available travel space value 15.0?
22. For the past decade rubber powder has been used in asphalt cement to improve performance. The article "Experimental Study of Recycled Rubber-Filled High-Strength Concrete" (_Mag. Concrete Res._, 2009: 549-556) included on a regression of \(y = \mathit{axial}\)\(\mathit{strength}\) (MPa) on \(x = \mathit{cube}\)\(\mathit{strength}\) (MPa) based on the following sample data: \[x \text{, }99.2\text{, }95.8\text{, }103.5\text{, }89.0\text{, }86.7\text{. }\] \[y \text{, }73.3\text{, }68.0\text{, }59.3\text{, }57.8\text{, }48.5\text{. }\] 1.

23. Show that the mle's of \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) are indeed the least squares estimates. [_Hint_: The pdf of \(Y_{i}\) is normal with mean \(\mu_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i}\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\); the likelihood is the product of the \(n\) pdf's.]
24. Denote the residuals by \(e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}\)\((e_{i} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})\) 1. Show that \(\sum e_{i} = 0\) and \(\sum x_{i}e_{i} = 0\). [_Hint_: Examine the two normal equations.] 2. Show that \(\hat{y}_{i} - \overline{y} = \hat{\beta}_{1}(x_{i} - \overline{x})\). 3. Use (a) and (b) to derive the analysis of variance identity for regression, Equation (12.4), by showing that the cross-product term is 0. 4.

25. A regression analysis is carried out with \(y = \) temperature, expressed in \({}^{\circ}\)C. How do the resulting values of \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) relate to those obtained if \(y\) is reexpressed in \({}^{\circ}\)F? Justify your assertion. [_Hint_: new \(y_{i} = y_{i}^{\prime} = 1.8y_{i} + 32.\)]

27. Show that the "point of averages" \((\overline{x},\overline{y})\) lies on the estimated regression line.
28. Suppose an investigator has data on the amount of shelf space \(x\) devoted to display of a particular product and sales revenue \(y\) for that product. The investigator may wish to fit a model for which the true regression line passes through (0, 0). The appropriate model is \(Y = \beta_{1}x + \varepsilon\). Assume that (\(x_{1}\), \(y_{1}\)),..., (\(x_{n}\), \(y_{n}\)) are observed pairs generated from this model, and derive the least squares estimator of \(\beta_{1}\). [_Hint_: Write the sum of squared deviations as a function of \(b_{1}\), a trial value, and use calculus to find the minimizing value of \(b_{1}\).]29. **a.**: Consider the data in Exercise 20. Suppose that instead of the least squares line passing through the points (\(x_{1}\), \(y_{1}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(x_{n}\), \(y_{n}\)), we wish the least squares line passing through \((x_{1}-\overline{x}\), \(y_{1}),\ldots,(x_{n}-\overline{x}\), \(y_{n}\)). Construct a scatter plot of the (\(x_{i}\), \(y_{i}\)) points and then of the (\(x_{i}-\overline{x}\), \(y_{i}\)) points. Use the plots to explain intuitively how the two least squares lines are related to each other. **b.**: Suppose that instead of the model \(Y_{i}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}+\varepsilon_{i}\quad(i=1,\ldots,n)\), we wish to fit a model of the form \(Y_{i}=\beta_{0}^{*}+\beta_{1}^{*}(x_{i}-\overline{x})+\varepsilon_{i}\quad(i= 1,\ldots,n)\). What are the least squares estimators of \(\beta_{0}^{*}\) and \(\beta_{1}^{*}\), and how do they relate to \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)?
30. Consider the following three data sets, in which the variables of interest are \(x=\) commuting distance and \(y=\) commuting time. Based on a scatter plot and the values of \(s\) and \(r^{2}\), in which situation would simple linear regression be most (least) effective, and why? 

In virtually all of our inferential work thus far, the notion of sampling variability has been pervasive. In particular, properties of sampling distributions of various statistics have been the basis for developing confidence interval formulas and hypothesis-testing methods. The key idea here is that the value of virtually any quantity calculated from sample data--the value of virtually any statistic--is going to vary from one sample to another.

Reconsider the global warming data on \(x=\) CO\({}_{2}\) and \(y=\) tree growth mass from Example 12.5 in the previous section. There are 8 observations, 2 at each of the \(x\) values 408, 554, 680, and 812. Suppose that the slope and intercept of the true regression line are \(\beta_{1}=.0085\) and \(\beta_{0}=-2.35\), with \(\sigma=.5\) (consistent with the values \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=.00845,\hat{\beta}_{0}=-2.349\), \(s=0.534\), computed in Example 12.10). Using R, we proceeded to generate a sample of random deviations \(\tilde{z}_{1},\ldots,\tilde{z}_{8}\) from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation.5, and then added \(\tilde{z}_{i}\) to \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i}\) to obtain 8 corresponding \(y\) values. Regression calculations were then carried out to obtain the estimated slope, intercept, and standard deviation. This process was repeated a total of 20 times, resulting in the values given in Table 12.1.

There is clearly variation in values of the estimated slope and estimated intercept, as well as the estimated standard deviation. The equation of the least squares line thus varies from one sample to the next. Figure 12.15 shows graphs of the true regression line and the 20 sample regression lines.

\end{table}
Table 11: Simulation results for Example 11The slope \(\beta_{1}\) of the population regression line is the true average change in the dependent variable \(y\) associated with a 1-unit increase in the independent variable \(x\). The slope of the least squares line,\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\), gives a point estimate of \(\beta_{1}\). In the same way that a confidence interval for \(\mu\) and procedures for testing hypotheses about \(\mu\) were based on properties of the sampling distribution of \(\overline{X}\), further inferences about \(\beta_{1}\) are based on thinking of\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) as a statistic and investigating its sampling distribution.

The values of the \(x_{i}\)'s are assumed to be chosen before the experiment is performed, so only the \(Y_{i}\)'s are random. The estimators (statistics, and thus random variables) for \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) are obtained by replacing \(y_{i}\) by \(Y_{i}\) in (12.2) and (12.3):

\[\hat{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})(Y_{i}-\overline{Y})}}{\sum{(x_ {i}-\overline{x})}^{2}},\quad\hat{\beta}_{0}=\frac{\sum{Y_{i}-\hat{\beta}_{1} \sum{x_{i}}}}{n}\]

Similarly, the estimator for \(\sigma^{2}\) results from replacing each \(y_{i}\) in the formula for \(s^{2}\) by the rv \(Y_{i}\):

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2}=S^{2}=\frac{\sum{Y_{i}^{2}-\hat{\beta}_{0}\sum{Y_{i}-\hat{ \beta}_{1}\sum{x_{i}Y_{i}}}}}{n-2}\]

The denominator of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\), \(S_{xx}=\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})}^{2}\), depends only on the \(x_{i}\)'s and not on the \(Y_{i}\)'s, so it is a constant. Then because \(\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})\overline{Y}=\overline{Y}\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})}}= \overline{Y}\cdot 0=0\), the slope estimator can be written as

\[\hat{\beta}_{1}=\frac{\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})Y_{i}}}{S_{xx}}=\sum{c_{i}Y_{i} }\quad\text{where }c_{i}={(x_{i}-\overline{x})}/{S_{xx}}\]

That is, \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is a linear function of the independent rv's \(Y_{1}\), \(Y_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(Y_{n}\), each of which is normally distributed. Invoking properties of a linear function of random variables discussed in Section 6.3 leads to the following results (Exercise 40).

1. The mean value of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is \(E(\hat{\beta}_{1})=\mu_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}=\beta_{1}\), so \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\beta_{1}\) (the distribution of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is always centered at the value of \(\beta_{1}\)).
2. The variance and standard deviation of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) are \[V(\hat{\beta}_{1})=\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}^{2}=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{S_{xx}} \qquad\quad\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}\] (12.5) where \(S_{xx}=\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})}^{2}=\sum{x_{i}^{2}-(\sum{x_{i}})}^{2}/n\). Replacing \(\sigma\) by its estimate \(s\) gives an estimate for \(\sigma_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}\) (the estimated standard deviation, i.e., estimated standard error, of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)): \[\hat{y}_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}=\frac{s}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}\] (This estimate can also be denoted by \(\hat{\sigma}_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}\).)
3. The estimator\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) has a normal distribution (because it is a linear function of independent normal rv's).

According to (12.5), the variance of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) equals the variance \(\sigma^{2}\) of the random error term--or, equivalently, of any \(Y_{i}\)--divided by \(\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\). Because \(\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\) is a measure of how spread out the \(x_{i}\)'s are about \(\overline{x}\), we conclude that making observations at \(x_{i}\) values that are quite spread out results in a more precise estimator of the slope parameter (smaller variance of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)), whereas values of \(x_{i}\) all close to each other imply a highly variable estimator. Of course, if the \(x_{i}\)'s are spread out too far, a linear model may not be appropriate throughout the range of observation.

Many inferential procedures discussed previously were based on standardizing an estimator by first subtracting its mean value and then dividing by its estimated standard deviation. In particular, test procedures and a CI for the mean \(\mu\) of a normal population utilized the fact that the standardized variable \((\overline{X}-\mu)/(S/\sqrt{n})\)--that is, \((\overline{X}-\mu)/S_{\hat{\mu}}\)--had a \(t\) distribution with \(n-1\) df. A similar result here provides the key to further inferences concerning \(\beta_{1}\).

The assumptions of the simple linear regression model imply that the standardized variable

\[T=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1}}{S/\sqrt{S_{xx}}}=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}- \beta_{1}}{S_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}}\]

has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-2\) df.

The \(T\) ratio can be written as

\[T=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1}}{S/\sqrt{S_{xx}}}=\frac{\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1 }-\beta_{1}}{\sigma/\sqrt{S_{xx}}}}{\sqrt{\frac{(n-2)S^{2}/\sigma^{2}}{(n-2)}}}\]

The theorem is a consequence of the following facts: \((\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1})/(\sigma/\sqrt{S_{xx}})\sim N(0,1)\), \((n-2)S^{2}/\sigma^{2}\sim\chi_{n-2}^{2}\), and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is independent of \(S^{2}\). That is, \(T\) is a standard normal rv divided by the square root of an independent chi-squared rv over its df, so \(T\) has the specified \(t\) distribution.

### A Confidence Interval for \(\beta_{1}\)

As in the derivation of previous CIs, we begin with a probability statement:

\[P\left(-t_{\alpha/2,n-2}<\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1}}{S_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}} \,<t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\right)=1-\alpha\]

Manipulation of the inequalities inside the parentheses to isolate \(\beta_{1}\) and substitution of estimates in place of the estimators gives the CI formula.

A 100(1 - _a_)% **CI for the slope \(b\)1** of the true regression line is

\[\hat{\beta}_{1}\pm t_{\nicefrac{{a}}{{2}},\pi - 2}\cdot\hat{y}_{{}_{1}}\]

This interval has the same general form as did many of our previous intervals. It is centered at the point estimate of the parameter, and the amount it extends out to each side of the estimate depends on the desired confidence level (through the \(t\) critical value) and on the amount of variability in the estimator \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) (through \(\hat{y}_{{}_{1}}\), which will tend to be small when there is little variability in the distribution of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) and large otherwise).

Is it possible to predict graduation rates from freshman test scores? Based on the average SAT score of entering freshmen at a university, can we predict the percentage of those freshmen who will get a degree there within 6 years? We use a random sample of 20 universities from the 248 national universities listed in the 2005 edition of _America's Best Colleges_, published by _U.S.News & World Report_.

The SAT scores were actually given in the form of first and third quartiles, so the average of those two numbers is used here. Notice that some of the SAT scores are not integers. Those values were computed from ACT scores using the NCAA formula \(\text{SAT}=-55.556\) + 44.444ACT, which is equivalent to saying that there is a linear relationship with 17 on the ACT corresponding to 700 on the SAT, and 26 on the ACT corresponding to 1100 on the SAT.

The scatter plot of the data in Figure 12.16 suggests the appropriateness of the linear regression model; graduation rate increases approximately linearly with SAT.

The values of the summary statistics required for calculation of the least squares estimates are

\[\sum x_{i} = 21,600.97\quad\quad\sum y_{i} = 1189\quad\sum x_{i}^{2} = 24,034,220.545\] \[\sum x_{i}y_{i} = 1,346,524.53\quad\sum y_{i}^{2} = 78,113\]

from which \(S_{xy}=62,346.86,\quad S_{xx}=704,125.298,\quad\hat{\beta}_{1}=.08854513,\quad \hat{\beta}_{0}=-36.1830309,\quad\mbox{SST}=7426.95,\quad\mbox{SSE}=1906.439, \quad r^{2}=1-1906.439/7426.95=.7433.\) Roughly 74% of the observed variation in graduation rate can be attributed to the simple linear regression model relationship between graduation rate and SAT. Error df is \(20-2=18\), giving \(s^{2}=1906.439/18=105.9\) and \(s=10.29\).

The estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is

\[\hat{\gamma}_{\hat{\beta}_{1}}=\frac{s}{\sqrt{S_{xx}}}=\frac{10.29}{\sqrt{704,125.298}}=.01226\]

The \(t\) critical value for a confidence level of 95% is \(t_{.025,18}=2.101\). The confidence interval is

\[.0885\pm(2.101)(.01226)=.0885\pm.0258=(.063,.114)\]

With a high degree of confidence, we estimate that an average increase in percentage graduation rate of between.063 and.114 is associated with a 1 point increase in SAT. Multiplying by 100 gives the change in graduation percentage corresponding to a 100 point increase in SAT, \(8.85\pm 2.58\), between 6.3 and 11.4. This shows that a substantial increase in graduation rate accompanies an increase of 100 SAT points. Is this a causal relationship, so a university president can count on an increased graduation rate if the admissions process becomes more selective in terms of entrance exam scores? One can imagine contrary scenarios, such as that more serious students attend more prestigious colleges, with higher entrance requirements and higher graduation rates, and that prestige would not be affected by an increase in entrance requirements. However, it seems more likely that

Figure 12: Scatter plot of the data from Example 12

prestige would benefit from higher test scores, so this scenario is not a very good argument against causality. In any case, there is at least one university president who claimed that increasing test scores resulted in a higher graduation rate.

Looking at the SAS output of Figure 12.17, we find the value of \(\hat{s}_{\hat{p}_{1}}\) under Parameter Estimates as the second number in the Standard Error column. All of the widely used statistical packages include this estimated standard error in output. There is also an estimated standard error for the statistic\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\). Confidence intervals for \(\beta_{1}\) and \(\beta_{0}\) appear on the output. For all of the statistics, compare the values on the SAS output with the values that we calculated.

The output shows the values of graduation rate, predicted values, and residuals. Matching the rows in Figure 12.17 with the corresponding rows in the original listing of the data, it is possible to see that the residuals for the private universities are mostly positive. However, it is much easier to see this in Figure 12.18, where the private

Figure 12.17: SAS output for the data of Example 12.12

universities are labeled "P" and the public universities are labeled "S." Of the seven private universities, five are above their predictions (positive residual) and one is barely below. Private universities mostly seem to achieve a higher graduation rate for a given entrance exam score (for more on this issue, see the rest of the story in Sections 12.6 and 12.7). It is interesting to speculate about why this might occur. Is there a more nurturing atmosphere with more individual attention at private schools? On the other hand, private universities might attract students who are more likely to graduate regardless of the campus atmosphere. \(\blacksquare\)

## Hypothesis-Testing Procedures

As before, the null hypothesis in a test about \(\beta_{1}\) will be an equality statement. The null value (value of \(\beta_{1}\) claimed true by the null hypothesis) will be denoted by \(\beta_{10}\) (read "beta one nought," _not_ "beta ten"). The test statistic results from replacing \(\beta_{1}\) in the standardized variable \(T\) by the null value \(\beta_{10}\)--that is, from standardizing the estimator of \(\beta_{1}\) under the assumption that \(H_{0}\) is true. The test statistic thus has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-2\) df when \(H_{0}\) is true, so the type I error probability is controlled at the desired level \(\alpha\) by using an appropriate \(t\) critical value.

The most commonly encountered pair of hypotheses about \(\beta_{1}\) is \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\). When this null hypothesis is true, \(\mu_{Y\cdot x}=\beta_{0}\) independent of \(x\), so knowledge of \(x\) gives no information about the value of the dependent variable. A test of these two hypotheses is often referred to as the _model utility test_ in simple linear regression. Unless \(n\) is quite small, \(H_{0}\) will be rejected and the utility of the model confirmed precisely when \(r^{2}\) is reasonably large. The simple linear regression model should not be used for further inferences (estimates of mean value or predictions of future values) unless the model utility test results in rejection of \(H_{0}\) for a suitably small \(\alpha\).

Figure 12.18: Comparing private and state universities

The parameter of interest is \(\beta_{1}\), the expected change in graduation rate associated with an increase of 1 in SAT score. The null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) will be rejected in favor of the alternative \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\) if the \(t\) ratio \(t=\hat{\beta}_{1}/\hat{\beta}_{\text{i}_{1}}\) satisfies either \(t\geq t_{\alpha/2,n-2}=t_{025,18}=2.101\) or \(t\leq-2.101\).

From Figure 12.19,\(\hat{\beta}_{1}=.08855\), \(\hat{\beta}_{\text{i}_{1}}=.01226\), and

\[t=\frac{.08855}{.01226}=7.22\quad\text{(also on output)}\]

Figure 12.19: MINITAB output for Example 12.13

Clearly, \(7.22\geq 2.101\), so \(H_{0}\) is resoundingly rejected. Alternatively, the \(P\)-value is twice the area captured under the 18 df \(t\) curve to the right of \(7.22\). MINITAB gives \(P\)-value \(=.000\), so \(H_{0}\) should be rejected at any reasonable \(\alpha\). This confirmation of the utility of the simple linear regression model gives us license to calculate various estimates and predictions as described in Section 12.4.

Notice that, in contrast, SAS in Figure 12.17 gives a \(P\)-value of \(<.0001\). This is better than the MINITAB \(P\)-value of \(.000\) because the MINITAB value could be incorrectly read as \(0\). Of course the actual value is positive, approximately \(.0000010\). When rounded to three decimals this gives the value \(.000\) printed by MINITAB.

Given the confidence interval of Example 12.12, the result of the hypothesis test should be no surprise. It should be clear, in the two-tailed test for \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) at level \(\alpha\), that \(H_{0}\) is rejected if and only if the \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) confidence interval fails to include \(0\). In the present instance, the \(95\%\) confidence interval did not include \(0\), so we should have known that the two-tailed test at level \(.05\) would reject \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\). 

## Regression and ANOVA

The splitting of the total sum of squares \(\sum{(y_{i}-\overline{y})}^{2}\) into a part SSE, which measures unexplained variation, and a part SSR, which measures variation explained by the linear relationship, is strongly reminiscent of one-way ANOVA. In fact, the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) can be tested against \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\) by constructing an ANOVA table (Table 12.2) and rejecting \(H_{0}\) if \(f\geq F_{\alpha,1,n-2}\).

The \(F\) test gives exactly the same result as the model utility \(t\) test because \(t^{2}=f\) and \(t_{\alpha/2,n-2}^{2}=F_{\alpha,1,n-2}\). Virtually all computer packages that have regression options include such an ANOVA table in the output. For example, Figure 12.17 shows SAS output for the university data of Example 12.12. The ANOVA table at the top of the output has \(f=52.12\) with a \(P\)-value of \(<.0001\) (the actual value is about \(.0000010\)) for the model utility test. The table of parameter estimates gives \(t=7.22\), again with \(P=<.0001\) (the actual value is about \(.0000010\)) and \(t^{2}=(7.22)^{2}=52.12=f\).

### Fitting the Logistic Regression Model

Recall from Section 12.1 that in the logistic regression model, the dependent variable \(Y\) is 1 if the observation is a success and 0 otherwise. The probability of success is related to a quantitative predictor \(x\) by the logit function \(p(x)=e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x}/(1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x})\). Fitting the model to sample data requires that the parameters \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) be estimated. The standard way of doing this is by the method of maximum likelihood. Suppose, for example, that \(n=5\) and that the observations made at \(x_{2}\), \(x_{4}\), and \(x_{5}\) are successes whereas the other two observations are failures. Then the likelihood function is

\[[1-p(x_{1})][p(x_{2})][1-p(x_{3})][p(x_{4})][p(x_{5})]\] \[=\left[\frac{1}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}}}\right]\left[ \frac{e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{2}}}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{2}}}\right] \left[\frac{1}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{3}}}\right]\left[\frac{e^{\beta_{0}+ \beta_{1}x_{4}}}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{4}}}\right]\left[\frac{e^{\beta_{0 }+\beta_{1}x_{5}}}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{5}}}\right]\]

Unfortunately it is not at all straightforward to maximize this likelihood, and there are no nice formulas for the mle's \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) The maximization process must be carried out using iterative numerical methods. The details are involved, but fortunately the most popular statistical software packages will do this on request and provide quantitative and graphical indications of how well the model fits.

In particular, the mle \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)is provided along with its estimated standard deviation \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\). For large \(n\), the estimator has approximately a normal distribution and the standardized variable \((\hat{\beta}_{1}-\beta_{1})/\hat{\beta}_{1}\) has approximately a standard normal distribution. This allows for calculation of a confidence interval for \(\beta_{1}\) as well as for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\), according to which the value of \(x\) has no impact on the likelihood of success. Some software packages report the value of the chi-squared statistic \(z^{2}\) rather than \(z\) itself, along with the corresponding \(P\)-value for a two-tailed test.

Here is data on launch temperature and the incidence of failure for O-rings in 23 space shuttle launches prior to the _Challenger_ disaster of January 1986.

Figure 12.20 shows JMP output for a logistic regression analysis. We have chosen to let \(p\) denote the probability of failure. Failures tended to occur at lower temperatures and successes at higher temperatures, so the graph of \(\hat{p}\) decreases as temperature increases. The estimate of \(\beta_{1}\) is \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=-.2322\), and the estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) is \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=.1082\). The value of \(z\) for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\), which asserts that temperature does not affect the likelihood of O-ring failure, is \(\hat{\beta}_{1}/\hat{\beta}_{1}=-.2322/.1082=-2.15\). The \(P\)-value is.032 (twice the area under thecurve to the left of \(-2.15\)). JMP reports the value of a chi-squared statistic, which is just \(z^{2}\), and the chi-squared \(P\)-value differs from that for \(z\) only because of rounding. For each 1-degree increase in temperature, we estimate that the odds of failure decrease by a factor of \(\hat{\varrho}_{1}=e^{-2322}\approx.79\). The launch temperature for the _Challenger_ mission was only \(31^{\circ}\)F. Because this value is much smaller than any temperature in our sample, it is dangerous to extrapolate the estimated relationship. Nevertheless, it appears that for a temperature this small, O-ring failure is almost a sure thing. The logistic regression gives the estimated probability at \(x=31\) as

\[p(31)=\frac{e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(31)}}{1+e^{\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(31)}}=\frac{ e^{15.0423-23215(31)}}{1+e^{15.0423-23215(31)}}=.99961\]

and the odds associated with this probability are \(.99961/(1-.99961)\approx 2563\). Thus, if the logistic regression can be extrapolated down to 31, the probability of failure is \(.99961\), the probability of success is \(.00039\), and the predicted odds are \(2563\) to \(1\) against success. Too bad this calculation was not done before launch!

## 12 References Concerning \(\mu_{Y.X^{*}}\) and the Prediction of Future \(Y\) Values

Let \(x^{*}\) denote a specified value of the independent variable \(x\). Once the estimates \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) have been calculated,\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) + \(\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) can be regarded either as a point estimate of \(\mu_{Y.x^{*}}\) (the expected or true average value of \(Y\) when \(x=x^{*}\)) or as a prediction of the \(Y\) value that will result from a single observation made when \(x=x^{*}\). The point estimate or prediction by itself gives no information concerning how precisely \(\mu_{Y.x^{*}}\) has been estimated or \(Y\) has been predicted. This can be remedied by developing a CI for \(\mu_{Y.x^{*}}\) and a prediction interval (PI) for a single \(Y\) value.

Before we obtain sample data, both \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) are subject to sampling variability--that is, they are both statistics whose values will vary from sample to sample. This variability was shown in Example 12.11 at the beginning of Section 12.3. Suppose, for example, that \(\hat{\beta}_{0}=50\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=2\). Then a first sample of \((x,y)\) pairs might give \(\hat{\beta}_{0}=52.35\), \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=1.895\), a second sample might result in \(\hat{\beta}_{0}=46.52\), \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=2.056\), and so on. It follows that \(\hat{Y}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) itself varies in value from sample to sample, so it is a statistic. If the intercept and slope of the population line are the aforementioned values 50 and 2, respectively, and \(x^{*}=10\), then this statistic is trying to estimate the value \(50+2(10)=70\). The estimate from a first sample might be \(52.35+1.895(10)=71.30\), from a second sample might be \(46.52+2.056(10)=67.08\), and so on. In the same way that a confidence interval for \(\beta_{1}\) was based on properties of the sampling distribution of \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\), a confidence interval for a mean \(y\) value in regression is based on properties of the sampling distribution of the statistic \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\).

Substitution of the expressions for \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) into \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) followed by some algebraic manipulation leads to the representation of\(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) as a linear function of the \(Y_{i}\)'s:

\[\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[\frac{1}{n}+\frac{(x ^{*}-\overline{x})(x_{i}-\overline{x})}{\sum{(x_{j}-\overline{x})}^{2}} \right]Y_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}d_{i}Y_{i}\]The coefficients \(d_{1}\), \(d_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(d_{n}\) in this linear function involve the \(x_{i}\)'s and \(x\)*, all of which are fixed. Application of the rules of Section 6.3 to this linear function gives the following properties. (Exercise 55 requests a derivation of Property 2.)

Let \(\hat{Y}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\), where \(x\)* is some fixed value of \(x\). Then

1. The mean value of \(\hat{Y}\) is \[E(\hat{Y})=E(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})=\mu_{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{ \beta}_{1}x^{*}}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\] Thus \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) is an unbiased estimator for \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\)* (i.e., for \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\)).
2. The variance of \(\hat{Y}\) is \[V(\hat{Y})=\sigma_{\hat{Y}}^{2}=\sigma^{2}\left[\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left(x^{*} -\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{\sum x_{i}^{2}-\left(\sum x_{i}\right)^{2}/n} \right]=\sigma^{2}\left[\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left(x^{*}-\overline{x}\right)^{2} }{S_{xx}}\right]\] and the standard deviation \(\sigma_{\hat{Y}}\) is the square root of this expression. The estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\), denoted by \(s_{\hat{Y}}\) or \(s_{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}}\), results from replacing \(\sigma\) by its estimate \(s\): \[s_{\hat{Y}}=s_{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}}=s\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{ \left(x^{*}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{S_{xx}}}\]
3. \(\hat{Y}\) has a normal distribution (because the \(Y_{i}\)'s are normally distributed and independent).

The variance of \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) is smallest when \(x^{*}=\overline{x}\) and increases as \(x\)* moves away from \(\overline{x}\) in either direction. Thus the estimator of \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\) is more precise when \(x\)* is near the center of the \(x_{i}\)'s than when it is far from the \(x\) values where observations have been made. This implies that both the CI and PI are narrower for an \(x\)* near \(\overline{x}\) than for an \(x\)* far from \(\overline{x}\). Most statistical computer packages provide both\(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) and \(s_{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}}\) for any specified \(x\)* upon request.

### Inferences Concerning \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\)

Just as inferential procedures for \(\beta_{1}\) were based on the \(t\) variable obtained by standardizing \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\), a \(t\) variable obtained by standardizing \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\) leads to a CI and test procedures here.

The variable \[T=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}-\left(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*} \right)}{S_{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}}}=\frac{\hat{Y}-\left(\beta_{ 0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\right)}{S_{\hat{Y}}}\] has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-2\) df.

As for \(\beta_{1}\) in the previous section, a probability statement involving this standardized variable can be manipulated to yield a confidence interval for \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\).

A 100(1 - \(\alpha\))% CI for \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\), the expected value of \(Y\) when \(x=x^{*}\), is

\[\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\cdot\hat{\gamma}_{ \hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}}=\hat{y}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\cdot s_{\hat{ Y}} \tag{12.7}\]

This CI is centered at the point estimate for \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\) and extends out to each side by an amount that depends on the confidence level and on the extent of variability in the estimator on which the point estimate is based.

Recall the university data of Example 12.12, where the dependent variable was graduation rate and the predictor was the average SAT for entering freshmen. Results from Example 12.12 include \(\sum x_{i}\)\(=21,\)600.97, \(S_{xx}=704,\)125.298, \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=.088545,\)\(\hat{\beta}_{0}=-36.18\), \(s=10.29\), and therefore \(\overline{x}=21,\)600.97/20 = 1080. Let's now calculate a confidence interval, using a 95% confidence level, for the mean graduation rate for all universities having an average freshman SAT of 1200--that is, a confidence interval for \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(1200)\). The interval is centered at

\[\hat{y}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}(1200)=-36.18+.0885(1200)=70.07\]

The estimated standard deviation of the statistic \(\hat{Y}\) is

\[s_{\hat{Y}}=s\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left(x^{*}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{S_{ xx}}}=10.29\sqrt{\frac{1}{20}+\frac{\left(1200-1080\right)^{2}}{704,125}}=2.731\]

The 18 df \(t\) critical value for a 95% confidence level is 2.101, from which we determine the desired interval to be

\[70.07\pm(2.101)(2.731)=70.07\pm 5.74=(64.33,75.81)\]

This rather wide CI suggests that we don't have terribly precise information about the mean value being estimated. Remember that if we recalculated this interval for sample after sample, in the long run about 95% of the calculated intervals would include \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(1200)\). We can only hope that this mean value lies in the single interval that we have calculated.

Figure 12.21 shows MINITAB output resulting from a request to calculate confidence intervals for the mean graduation rate when the SAT is 1100 and 1200. Because this optional output was requested, the confidence intervals (Figure 12.21) were appended to the bottom of the regression output given in Figure 12.19. Note that the first interval is narrower than the second, because 1100 is much closer to \(\overline{x}\) than is 1200. Figure 12.22 shows curves corresponding to the confidence limits for each different \(x\) value. Notice how the curves get farther and farther apart as \(x\) moves away from \(\overline{x}\). The output labeled PI in Figure 12.21 and the curves labeled PI in Figure 12.22 refer to prediction intervals, to be discussed shortly.

In some situations, a CI is desired not just for a single \(x\) value but for two or more \(x\) values. Suppose an investigator wishes a CI both for \(\mu_{Y\cdot v}\) and for \(\mu_{Y\cdot w}\) where \(v\) and \(w\) are two different values of the independent variable. It is tempting to compute the interval (12.7) first for \(x=v\) and then for \(x=w\). Suppose we use \(\alpha=.05\) in each computation to get two 95% intervals. Then if the variables involved in computing the two intervals were independent of each other, the joint confidence coefficient would be (.95) \(\bullet\) (.95) \(\approx.90\).

Unfortunately, the intervals are not independent because the same \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\),\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\), and \(S\) are used in each. We therefore cannot assert that the joint confidence level for the two intervals is exactly 90%. However, Exercise 79 of Chapter 8 derives the Bonferroni inequality showing that, if the 100(1 - \(\alpha\))% CI (12.7) is computed both for \(x=v\) and for \(x=w\) to obtain joint CIs for \(\mu_{Y\cdot v}\) and \(\mu_{Y\cdot w}\), then _the joint confidence level on the resulting pair of intervals is at least_ 100(1 - 2\(\alpha\))%. In particular, using \(\alpha=.05\) results in a joint confidence level of _at least_ 90%, whereas using \(\alpha=.01\) results in at least 98% confidence. For example, in Example 12.15 a 95% CI for \(\mu_{Y\cdot 1100}\) was (56.35, 66.08) and a 95% CI for \(\mu_{Y\cdot 1200}\) was (64.33, 75.81). The simultaneous or joint confidence level for the two statements \(56.35<\mu_{Y\cdot 1100}<66.08\) and \(64.33<\mu_{Y\cdot 1200}<75.81\) is at least 90%.

Figure 12.22: MINITAB scatter plot with confidence intervals and prediction intervals for the data of Example 12.15

Figure 12.23: MINITAB regression output for the data of Example 12.15

The joint CIs are referred to as _Bonferroni intervals_. The method is easily generalized to yield joint intervals for \(k\) different \(\mu_{Y,x}\)'s. _Using the interval_ (12.7) _separately first for \(x=x_{1}^{*}\) then for \(x=x_{2}^{*},\ldots,\) and finally for \(x=x_{k}^{*}\) yields a set of \(k\) CIs for which the joint or simultaneous confidence level is guaranteed to be at least \(100(1-k\alpha)\%\)._

Tests of hypotheses about \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\) are based on the test statistic \(T\) obtained by replacing \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\) in the numerator of (12.6) by the null value \(\mu_{0}\). For example, the assertion \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}(1200)=75\) in Example 12.15 says that when the average SAT is 1200, expected (i.e., true average) graduation rate is 75%. The test statistic value is then \(t=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}(1200)-75]/\hat{\gamma}_{\hat{\beta}_{0}\hat{ \mu}_{1}(1200)}\), and the test is upper-, lower-, or two-tailed according to the inequality in \(H_{\text{a}}\).

## Appendix A Prediction Interval for a Future Value of \(Y\)

Analogous to the CI (12.7) for \(\mu_{Y,x^{*}}\), one frequently wishes to obtain an interval of plausible values for the value of \(Y\) associated with some future observation when the independent variable has value \(x^{*}\). In the scenario of Example 12.5, the CI (12.7) can be used to provide an interval estimate of true average tree mass for all trees exposed to CO\({}_{2}\) concentration \(x=600\). Alternatively, we might wish an interval of plausible values for the mass of a single such tree.

A CI refers to a parameter, or population characteristic, whose value is fixed but unknown to us. In contrast, a future value of \(Y\) is not a parameter but instead a random variable; for this reason we refer to an interval of plausible values for a future \(Y\) as a **prediction interval** rather than a confidence interval. For the confidence interval we use the error of estimation, \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}-(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})\), a difference between a fixed (but unknown) quantity and a random variable. The error of prediction is \(Y-(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}+\varepsilon-( \hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})\), a difference between two random variables. With the additional random \(\varepsilon\) term, there is more uncertainty in prediction than in estimation, so a PI will be wider than a CI. Because the future value \(Y\) is independent of the observed \(Y_{i}\)'s,

\[V[Y-(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})] =\text{ variance of prediction error}\] \[=V(Y)+V(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})\] \[=\sigma^{2}+\sigma^{2}\Bigg{[}\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left(x^{*}- \overline{x}\right)^{2}}{S_{xx}}\Bigg{]}\] \[=\sigma^{2}\Bigg{[}1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\left(x^{*}-\overline{x} \right)^{2}}{S_{xx}}\Bigg{]}\]

Furthermore, because \(E(Y)=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\) and \(E(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\), the expected value of the prediction error is \(E[Y-(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*})]=0\). It can then be shown that the standardized variable

\[T=\frac{Y-(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})}{S\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{ \left(x^{*}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{S_{xx}}}}\]has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-2\) df. Substituting this \(T\) into the probability statement \(P(-t_{\alpha/2,n-2}<T<t_{\alpha/2,n-2})=1-\alpha\) and manipulating to isolate \(Y\) between the two inequalities yields the following interval.

A \(100(1-\alpha)\%\)**PI for a future \(Y\) observation to be made when \(x=x^{\Phi}\)** is

\[\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\cdot s\sqrt{1+\frac{1 }{n}+\frac{\left(x^{*}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}{S_{xx}}}\] \[= \hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\cdot \sqrt{s^{2}+\frac{s_{\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}}}{\left.\kern-1.2pt \vphantom{\beta}\right.}}\] \[= \hat{y}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\cdot\sqrt{s^{2}+s_{\hat{Y}}^{2}} \tag{12.8}\]

The interpretation of the prediction level \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) is identical to that of previous confidence levels--if (12.8) is used repeatedly, in the long run the resulting intervals will actually contain the observed \(y\) values \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) of the time. Notice that the 1 underneath the initial square root symbol makes the PI (12.8) wider than the CI (12.7), although the intervals are both centered at \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*}\). Also, as \(n\to\infty\) the width of the CI approaches 0, whereas the width of the PI approaches \(2z_{\alpha/2}\sigma\) (because even with perfect knowledge of \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\), there will still be uncertainty in prediction).

Let's return to the university data of Example 12.15 and calculate a 95% prediction interval for a graduation rate that would result from selecting a single university whose average SAT is 1200. Relevant quantities from that example are

\[\hat{y}=70.07\quad s_{\hat{Y}}=2.731\quad s=10.29\]

For a prediction level of 95% based on \(n-2=18\) df, the \(t\) critical value is 2.101, exactly what we previously used for a 95% confidence level. The prediction interval is then

\[70.07\pm(2.101)\sqrt{10.29^{2}+2.731^{2}} = 70.07\pm(2.101)(10.646)\] \[= 70.07\pm 22.37=(47.70,92.44)\]

Plausible values for a single observation on graduation rate when SAT is 1200 are (at the 95% prediction level) between 47.70% and 92.44%. The 95% confidence interval for graduation rate when SAT is 120 was (64.33, 75.81). The prediction interval is much wider than this because of the extra \(10.29^{2}\) under the square root. Figure 12.22, the MINITAB output for Example 12.15, shows this interval as well as the confidence interval.

The Bonferroni technique can be employed as in the case of confidence intervals. If a PI with prediction level \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) is calculated for each of \(k\) different values of \(x\), the simultaneous or joint prediction level for all \(k\) intervals is at least \(100(1-k\alpha)\%\).

The article "Cotton Square Damage by the Plant Bug, _Lysgus hesperus_, and Abscission Rates" (\(J.\ Econ.\ Entomol.\), 1988: 1328-1337) reports data on \(x=\) age of a cotton plant (days) and \(y=\) % damaged squares. Consider the accompanying \(n=12\) observations (read from a scatter plot in the article). 

## 25 Correlation

In many situations the objective in studying the joint behavior of two variables is to see whether they are related, rather than to use one to predict the value of the other. In this section, we first develop the sample correlation coefficient \(r\) as a measure of how strongly related two variables \(x\) and \(y\) are in a sample and then relate \(r\) to the correlation coefficient \(\rho\) defined in Chapter 5.

### The Sample Correlation Coefficient \(r\)

Given \(n\) pairs of observations \((x_{1},y_{1})\), \((x_{2},y_{2})\), \(\ldots\), \((x_{n},y_{n})\), it is natural to speak of \(x\) and \(y\) having a positive relationship if large \(x\)'s are paired with large \(y\)'s and small \(x\)'s with small \(y\)'s. Similarly, if large \(x\)'s are paired with small \(y\)'s and small \(x\)'s with large \(y\)'s, then a negative relationship between the variables is implied. Consider the quantity

\[S_{xy}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} {x_{i}y_{i}-\frac{\left(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)\left(\sum\limits_{ i=1}^{n}{y_{i}}\right)}{n}}\]

Then if the relationship is strongly positive, an \(x_{i}\) above the mean \(\overline{x}\) will tend to be paired with a \(y_{i}\) above the mean \(\overline{y}\), so that \((x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})>0\), and this product will also be positive whenever both \(x_{i}\) and \(y_{i}\) are below their respective means. Thus a positive relationship implies that \(S_{xy}\) will be positive. An analogous argument shows that when the relationship is negative, \(S_{xy}\) will be negative, since most of the products \((x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})\) will be negative. This is illustrated in Figure 23.

Although \(S_{xy}\) seems a plausible measure of the strength of a relationship, we do not yet have any idea of how positive or negative it can be. Unfortunately, \(S_{xy}\) has a serious defect: By changing the unit of measurement for either \(x\) or \(y\), \(S_{xy}\) can be made either arbitrarily large in magnitude or arbitrarily close to zero. For example, if \(S_{xy}=25\) when \(x\) is measured in meters, then \(S_{xy}=25000\) when \(x\) is measured in millimeters and.025 when \(x\) is expressed in kilometers. A reasonable condition to impose on any measure of how strongly \(x\) and \(y\) are related is that the calculated measure should not depend on the particular unit used to measure them. This condition is achieved by modifying \(S_{xy}\) to obtain the sample correlation coefficient.

An accurate assessment of soil productivity is critical to rational land-use planning. Unfortunately, as the author of the article "Productivity Ratings Based on Soil Series" (_Prof. Geographer_, 1980: 158-163) argues, an acceptable soil productivity index is not so easy to come by. One difficulty is that productivity is determined partly by which crop is planted, and the relationship between yield of two different crops planted in the same soil may not be very strong. To illustrate, the article presents the accompanying data on corn yield \(x\) and peanut yield \(y\) (mT/ha) for eight different types of soil.

\[\begin{array}{l|cccccccc}x&2.4&3.4&4.6&3.7&2.2&3.3&4.0&2.1\\ \hline y&1.33&2.12&1.80&1.65&2.00&1.76&2.11&1.63\\ \end{array}\]

With \(\sum x_{i}=25.7\), \(\sum y_{i}=14.40\), \(\sum x_{i}^{2}=88.31\), \(\sum x_{i}y_{i}=46.856\), \(\sum y_{i}^{2}=26.4324\),

\[\begin{array}{l}S_{xx}=88.31-\frac{25.7^{2}}{8}=88.31-82.56=5.75\\ S_{yy}=26.4324-\frac{14.40^{2}}{8}=.5124\\ S_{xy}=46.856-\frac{(25.7)(14.40)}{8}=.5960\end{array}\]from which

\[r=\frac{.5960}{\sqrt{5.75}\sqrt{.5124}}=.347\]

### Properties of \(r\)

The most important properties of \(r\) are as follows:

1. The value of \(r\) does not depend on which of the two variables is labeled \(x\) and which is labeled \(y\).
2. The value of \(r\) is independent of the units in which \(x\) and \(y\) are measured.
3. \(-1\leq r\leq 1\)
4. \(r=1\) if and only if (iff) all (\(x_{i}\), \(y_{i}\)) pairs lie on a straight line with positive slope, and \(r=-1\) iff all (\(x_{i}\), \(y_{i}\)) pairs lie on a straight line with negative slope.
5. The square of the sample correlation coefficient gives the value of the coefficient of determination that would result from fitting the simple linear regression model--in symbols, \((r)^{2}=r^{2}\).

Property 1 should be evident. Exercise 66 asks you to verify Property 2. To derive Property 5, recall the regression analysis of variance identity (12.4), \([\text{SST}=\text{SSE}+\text{SSR}=\text{SSE}+\sum\left(\hat{y}_{i}-\overline{y }\right)^{2}]\). It is easily shown [Exercise 24(b)] that \(\hat{y}_{i}-\overline{y}=\hat{\beta}_{1}(x_{i}-\overline{x})\), and therefore

\[\sum\left(\hat{y}_{i}-\overline{y}\right)^{2}= \hat{\beta}_{1}^{2}\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2} =\left[\frac{\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)\left(y_{i}- \overline{y}\right)}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\right]^{2}\sum \left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\] \[=\frac{\left[\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)\left(y_{i}- \overline{y}\right)\right]^{2}}{\sum\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}\sum \left(y_{i}-\overline{y}\right)^{2}}\sum\left(y_{i}-\overline{y}\right)^{2}= \left(r\right)^{2}\text{SST}\]

Here \(\left(r\right)^{2}\) is the square of the correlation coefficient. Substituting this result into the identity (12.4) gives \(\text{SST}=\text{SSE}+\left(r\right)^{2}\text{SST}\), so \((r)^{2}=(\text{SST}-\text{SSE})/\text{SST}\), completing the derivation of Property 5.

Because \((r)^{2}=(\text{SST}-\text{SSE})/\text{SST}\), and the numerator cannot be bigger than the denominator, Property 3 follows immediately. Furthermore, because the ratio can be 1 if and only if \(\text{SSE}=0\), we conclude that \(r^{2}=1\) if and only if all the points fall on a straight line. If the correlation is positive this will be a line with positive slope, and if the correlation is negative it will be a line with negative slope, so we have verified Property 4.

Property 1 stands in marked contrast to what happens in regression analysis, where virtually all quantities of interest (the estimated slope, estimated \(y\)-intercept, \(s^{2}\), etc.) depend on which of the two variables is treated as the dependent variable. However, Property 5 shows that the proportion of variation in the dependent variable explained by fitting the simple linear regression model does not depend on which variable plays this role.

Property 2 is equivalent to saying that \(r\) is unchanged if each \(x_{i}\) is replaced by \(cx_{i}\) and if each \(y_{i}\) is replaced by \(dy_{i}\) (where \(c\) and \(d\) are positive, giving a change in the scale of measurement), as well as if each \(x_{i}\) is replaced by \(x_{i}-a\) and \(y_{i}\) by \(y_{i}-b\)(which changes the location of zero on the measurement axis). This implies, for example, that \(r\) is the same whether temperature is measured in \({}^{\circ}\)F or \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Property 3 tells us that the maximum value of \(r\), corresponding to the largest possible degree of positive relationship, is \(r=1\), whereas the most negative relationship is identified with \(r=-1\). According to Property 4, the largest positive and largest negative correlations are achieved only when all points lie along a straight line. Any other configuration of points, even if the configuration suggests a deterministic relationship between variables, will yield an \(r\) value less than 1 in absolute magnitude. Thus \(r\)_measures the degree of linear relationship_ among variables. A value of \(r\) near 0 is not evidence of the lack of a strong relationship, but only the absence of a linear relation, so that such a value of \(r\) must be interpreted with caution. Figure 12.24 illustrates several configurations of points associated with different values of \(r\).

A frequently asked question is, "When can it be said that there is a strong correlation between the variables, and when is the correlation weak?" A reasonable rule of thumb is to say that the correlation is weak if \(0\leq|r|\leq.5\), strong if \(.8\leq|r|\leq 1\), and moderate otherwise. It may surprise you that \(r=.5\) is considered weak, but \(r^{2}=.25\) implies that in a regression of \(y\) on \(x\), only 25% of observed \(y\) variation would be explained by the model. In Example 12.17, the correlation between corn yield and peanut yield would be described as weak.

### The Population Correlation Coefficient \(\rho\) and Inferences About Correlation

The correlation coefficient \(r\) is a measure of how strongly related \(x\) and \(y\) are in the observed sample. We can think of the pairs \((x_{i},y_{i})\) as having been drawn from a bivariate population of pairs, with \((X_{i},Y_{i})\) having joint probability distribution \(f(x,y)\). In Chapter 5, we defined the correlation coefficient \(\rho(X,Y)\) by

Figure 12.24: Data plots for different values of \(r\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:679]

The small-sample intervals and test procedures presented in Chapters 8-10 were based on an assumption of population normality. To test hypotheses about \(\rho\), we must make an analogous assumption about the distribution of pairs of \((x,y)\) values in the population. We are now assuming that _both_\(X\) and \(Y\) are random, with joint distribution given by the bivariate normal pdf introduced in Section 5.3.

If \(X=x\), recall that the (conditional) distribution of \(Y\) is normal with mean \(\mu_{Y,x}=\mu_{2}+(\rho\sigma_{2}/\sigma_{1})(x-\mu_{1})\) and variance \((1-\rho^{2})\sigma_{2}^{2}\). This is exactly the model used in simple linear regression with \(\beta_{0}=\mu_{2}-\rho\mu_{1}\sigma_{2}/\sigma_{1},\beta_{1}=\rho\sigma_{2}/ \sigma_{1}\), and \(\sigma^{2}=(1-\rho^{2})\sigma_{2}^{2}\) independent of \(x\). The implication is that _if the observed pairs_ (\(x_{i},y_{i}\)) _are actually drawn from a bivariate normal distribution_, _then the simple linear regression model is an appropriate way of studying the behavior of \(Y\) for fixed \(x\)._ If \(\rho=0\), then \(\mu_{Y,x}=\mu_{2}\) independent of \(x\);_ in fact, when \(\rho=0\) the joint probability density function \(f(x,y)\) can be factored into a part involving \(x\) only and a part involving \(y\) only, which implies that \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent variables.

As discussed in Section 5.3, contours of the bivariate normal distribution are elliptical, and this suggests that a scatter plot of observed \((x,y)\) pairs from such a joint distribution should have a roughly elliptical shape. The accompanying scatter plot of \(y=\) visceral fat (cm\({}^{2}\)) by the CT method versus \(x=\) visceral fat (cm\({}^{2}\)) by the US method for a sample of \(n=100\) obese women appeared in the paper "Methods of Estimation of Visceral Fat: Advantages of Ultrasonography" (_Obes. Res._, 2003: 1488-1494). Computerized tomography is considered the most accurate technique for body fat measurement, but is costly, time consuming, and involves exposure to ionizing radiation; the US method is noninvasive and less expensive.

The pattern in the scatter plot seems consistent with an assumption of bivariate normality. Here \(r=.71\), which is not all that impressive (\(r^{2}=.50\)), but the investigators reported that a test of \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) (to be introduced shortly) gives \(P\)-value \(<.001\). Of course we would want values from the two methods to be very highly correlated before regarding one as an adequate substitute for the other.

Figure 12.25: Scatter Plot for Example 12.19

Assuming that the pairs are drawn from a bivariate normal distribution allows us to test hypotheses about \(\rho\) and to construct a CI. There is no completely satisfactory way to check the plausibility of the bivariate normality assumption. A partial check involves constructing two separate normal probability plots, one for the sample \(x_{i}\)'s and another for the sample \(y_{i}\)'s, since bivariate normality implies that the marginal distributions of both \(X\) and \(Y\) are normal. If either plot deviates substantially from a straight-line pattern, the following inferential procedures should not be used when the sample size \(n\) is small. Also, as discussed in Example 12.19, the scatter plot should show a roughly elliptical shape.

Neurotoxic effects of manganese are well known and are usually caused by high occupational exposure over long periods of time. In the fields of occupational hygiene and environmental hygiene, the relationship between lipid peroxidation, which is responsible for deterioration of foods and damage to live tissue, and occupational exposure had not been previously reported. The article "Lipid Peroxidation in Workers Exposed to Manganese" (_Scand_. \(J\). _Work Environ. Health_, 1996: 381-386) gave data on \(x=\) manganese concentration in blood (ppb) and \(y=\) concentration (\(\mu\)mol/L) of malondialdehyde, which is a stable product of lipid peroxidation, both for a sample of 22 workers exposed to manganese and for a control sample of 45 individuals. The value of \(r\) for the control sample was.29, from which

\[t=\frac{(.29)\sqrt{45-2}}{\sqrt{1-.29^{2}}}\approx 2.0\]

The corresponding \(P\)-value for a two-tailed \(t\) test based on 43 df is roughly.052 (the cited article reported only that the \(P\)-value \(>\).05). We would not want to reject the assertion that \(\rho=0\) at either significance level.01 or.05. For the sample of exposed workers, \(r=\).83 and \(t=\) 6.7, clear evidence that there is a positive relationship in the entire population of exposed workers from which the sample was selected. Although in general correlation does not necessarily imply causation, it is plausible here that higher levels of manganese cause higher levels of peroxidation.

Because \(\rho\) measures the extent to which there is a linear relationship between the two variables in the population, the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) states that there is no such population relationship. In Section 12.3, we used the \(t\) ratio\(\hat{\beta}_{1}/\hat{y}_{1}\) to test for a linear relationship between the two variables in the context of regression analysis. It turns out that the two test procedures are completely equivalent because \(r\sqrt{n-2}/\sqrt{1-r^{2}}=\hat{\beta}_{1}/\hat{y}_{1}\) (Exercise 65). When interest lies only in assessing the strength of any linear relationship rather than in fitting a model and using it to estimate or predict, the test statistic formula just presented requires fewer computations than does the \(t\) ratio.

### Other Inferences Concerning \(\rho\)

The procedure for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=\rho_{0}\) when \(\rho_{0}\neq 0\) is not equivalent to any procedure from regression analysis. The test statistic is based on a transformation of \(R\) called the Fisher transformation.

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & When (\(X_{1}\), \(Y_{1}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(X_{n}\), \(Y_{n}\)) is a sample from a bivariate normal distribution, the rv \\  & \\ \(V=\frac{1}{2}\,\ln\left(\frac{1+R}{1-R}\right)\) & \\ has approximately a normal distribution with mean and variance \\  & \\ \(\mu_{V}=\frac{1}{2}\,\ln\left(\frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}\right)\) & \(\sigma_{V}^{2}=\frac{1}{n-3}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The rationale for the transformation is to obtain a function of \(R\) that has a variance independent of \(r\); this would not be the case with \(R\) itself. Also, the approximation will not be valid if \(n\) is quite small.

\begin{tabular}{c c} Alternative Hypothesis & Rejection Region for Level \(\alpha\) Test \\ \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\rho>\rho_{0}\) & \(z\geq z_{\rm a}\) \\ \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\rho<\rho_{0}\) & \(z\leq-z_{\rm a}\) \\ \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\rho\neq\rho_{0}\) & either \(z\geq z_{\rm a/2}\) or \(z\leq-z_{\rm a/2}\) \\ \end{tabular}

A \(P\)-value can be calculated in the same manner as for previous \(z\) tests.

As far back as Leonardo da Vinci, it was known that height and wingspan (measured fingertip to fingertip between outstretched hands) are closely related. For these measurements (in inches) from 16 students in a statistics class notice how close the two values are.

\[\begin{array}{l} {\mathit{Student}:}\quad 1\quad 2\quad 3\quad 4\quad 5\quad 6\quad 7\quad 8\\ {\mathit{Height}:}\quad 63.0\quad 63.0\quad 65.0\quad 64.0\quad 68.0\quad 69.0\quad 71.0\quad 68.0\\ {\mathit{Wingspan}:}\quad 62.0\quad 62.0\quad 64.0\quad 64.5\quad 67.0\quad 69.0\quad 70.0\quad 72.0\\ {\mathit{Student}:}\quad 9\quad 10\quad 11\quad 12\quad 13\quad 14\quad 15\quad 16\\ {\mathit{Height}:}\quad 68.0\quad 72.0\quad 73.0\quad 73.5\quad 70.0\quad 70.0\quad 72.0\quad 74.0\\ {\mathit{Wingspan}:}\quad 70.0\quad 72.0\quad 73.0\quad 75.0\quad 71.0\quad 70.0\quad 76.0\quad 76.5\\ \end{array}\]

The scatter plot in Figure 12.26 shows an approximately linear shape, and the point cloud is roughly elliptical. Also, the normal plots for the individual variables are roughly linear, so the bivariate normal distribution can reasonably be assumed.

The correlation is computed to be.9422. Can it be conclude that wingspan and height are highly correlated, in the sense that \(\rho>.8?\) To carry out a test of \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=.8\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\rho>.8\), we Fisher transform.9422 and.8:

\[\frac{1}{2}\ln\!\left(\frac{1+.9422}{1-.9422}\right)=1.757\qquad\frac{1}{2}\ln \!\left(\frac{1+.8}{1-.8}\right)=1.099\]

The calculation is easily done on a calculator with hyperbolic functions, because the inverse hyperbolic tangent is equivalent to the Fisher transformation. That is, \(\tanh^{-1}(.9422)=1.757\quad\text{and}\quad\tanh^{-1}(.8)=1.099\). Compute \(z=(1.757-1.099)/(1/\sqrt{16-3})=2.37\). Since \(2.37\geq 1.645\), at level.05 we can reject \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=.8\) in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\rho\geq.8\). Indeed, because \(2.37\geq 2.33\), it is also true that we can reject \(H_{0}\) in this one-tailed test at the.01 level, and conclude that wingspan is highly correlated with height.

Figure 12.26: Wingspan plotted against height

To obtain a CI for \(\rho\), we first derive an interval for \(\mu_{V}=\frac{1}{2}\,\ln[(1+\rho)/(1-\rho)]\). Standardizing \(V\), writing a probability statement, and manipulating the resulting inequalities yields

\[\left(v-\frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{\sqrt{n-3}},v+\frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{\sqrt{n-3}}\right) \tag{12.11}\]

as a \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) interval for \(\mu_{V}\), where \(v=\frac{1}{2}\,\ln[(1+r)/(1-r)]\). This interval can then be manipulated to yield a CI for \(\rho\).

A \(100(1-\alpha)\%\) confidence interval for \(\rho\) is

\[\left(\frac{e^{2c_{1}}-1}{e^{2c_{1}}+1},\frac{e^{2c_{2}}-1}{e^{2c_{2}}+1}\right)\]

where \(c_{1}\) and \(c_{2}\) are the left and right endpoints, respectively, of the interval (12.11).

The sample correlation coefficient between wingspan and height was \(r=.9422\), giving \(v=1.757\). With \(n=16\), a \(95\%\) confidence interval for \(\mu_{v}\) is \(1.757\pm 1.96/\sqrt{16-3}=(1.213,2.301)=(c_{1},c_{2})\).

The \(95\%\) interval for \(\rho\) is

\[\left[\frac{e^{2(1.213)}-1}{e^{2(1.213)}+1},\frac{e^{2(2.301)}-1}{e^{2(2.301)} +1}\right]=(.838,\,.980)\]

As before, this calculation can be done more easily using the hyperbolic tangent, which is the inverse of the Fisher transformation. This gives (tanh(1.213), tanh(2.301)) = (.838,.980). Notice that this interval excludes.8, and that our hypothesis test in Example 12.21 would have rejected \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=.8\) in favor of the alternative \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\rho>.8\) at the.025 level.

Absent the assumption of bivariate normality, a bootstrap procedure can be used to obtain a CI for \(\rho\) or test hypotheses.

In Chapter 5, we cautioned that a large value of the correlation coefficient (near 1 or \(-1\)) implies only association and not causation. This applies to both \(\rho\) and \(r\). It is easy to find strong but weird correlations in which neither variable is casually related to the other. For example, since prohibition ended in the 1930s, beer consumption and church attendance have correlated very highly. Of course, the reason is that both variables have increased in accord with population growth.

Endocrinol._, 1978: 219-226) reports data on the effects of the drug tamoxifen on change in the level of cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) of patients during treatment. With age \(=x\) and \(\Delta\)CBG \(=y\), summary values are \(n=26\), \(\sum x_{i}=1613\), \(\sum(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}=3756.96\), \(\sum y_{i}=281.9\), \(\sum(y_{i}-\overline{y})^{2}=465.34\), and \(\sum x_{i}y_{i}=16,731\) * Compute a 90% CI for the true correlation coefficient \(\rho\). * Test \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=-.5\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\rho<-.5\) at level.05. * In a regression analysis of \(y\) on \(x\), what proportion of variation in change of cortisol-binding globulin level could be explained by variation in patient age within the sample? * If you decide to perform a regression analysis with age as the dependent variable, what proportion of variation in age is explainable by variation in \(\Delta\)CBG?
63. A sample of \(n=500\) (\(x,y\)) pairs was collected and a test of \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\rho\neq 0\) was carried out. The resulting \(P\)-value was computed to be.00032. * What conclusion would be appropriate at level of significance.001? * Does this small \(P\)-value indicate that there is a very strong relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) (a value of \(\rho\) that differs considerably from 0)? Explain. * Now suppose a sample of \(n=10,000\) (\(x,y\)) pairs resulted in \(r=.022\). Test \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\rho\neq 0\) at level.05. Is the result statistically significant? Comment on the practical significance of your analysis.
64. Let \(x\) be number of hours per week of studying and \(y\) be grade point average. Suppose we have one sample of (\(x\), \(y\)) pairs for females and another for males. Then we might like to test the hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\rho_{1}-\rho_{2}=0\) against the alternative that the two population correlation coefficients are different. * Use properties of the transformed variable \(V=.5\)ln[(1 + _R_)/(1 - _R_)] to propose an appropriate test statistic and rejection region (let \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) denote the two sample correlation coefficients). * The paper "Relational Bonds and Customer's Trust and Commitment: A Study on the Moderating Effects of Web Site Usage" (_Serv. Ind. J._, 2003: 103-124) reported that \(n_{1}=261\), \(r_{1}=.59\), \(n_{2}=557\), \(r_{2}=.50\), where the first sample consisted of corporate website users and the second of non-users; here \(r\) is the correlation between an assessment of the strength of economic bonds and performance. Carry out the test for this data (as did the authors of the cited paper).
65. Verify that the \(t\) ratio for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) in Section 12.3 is identical to \(t\) for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\).
66. Verify Property 2 of the correlation coefficient: the value of \(r\) is independent of the units in which \(x\) and \(y\) are measured; that is, if \(x_{i}^{\prime}=ax_{i}+c\) and \(y_{i}^{\prime}=by_{i}+d\), \(a>0\), \(b>0\), then \(r\) for the (\(x_{i}^{\prime},y_{i}^{\prime}\)) pairs is the same as \(r\) for the (\(x_{i},y_{i}\)) pairs.

67. Consider a time series--that is, a sequence of observations \(X_{1},X_{2},\ldots\) on some response variable (e.g., concentration of a pollutant) over time--with observed values \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) over \(n\) time periods. Then the _lag_\(1\)_autocorrelation coefficient_ is defined as \[r_{1}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n-1}\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)\left(x_{i+1} -\overline{x}\right)}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}-\overline{x}\right)^{2}}\] Autocorrelation coefficients \(r_{2}\), \(r_{3}\), \(\ldots\) for lags 2, 3, \(\ldots\) are defined analogously. **a.**: Calculate the values of \(r_{1}\), \(r_{2}\), and \(r_{3}\) for the temperature data from Exercise 79 of Chapter 1. **b.**: Consider the \(n-1\) pairs (\(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\)), (\(x_{2}\), \(x_{3}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(x_{n-1}\), \(x_{n}\)). What is the difference between the formula for the sample correlation coefficient \(r\) applied to these pairs and the formula for \(r_{1}\)? What if \(n\), the length of the series, is large? What about \(r_{2}\) compared to \(r\) for the \(n-2\) pairs (\(x_{1}\), \(x_{3}\)), (\(x_{2}\), \(x_{4}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(x_{n-2}\), \(x_{n}\))? **c.**: Analogous to the population correlation coefficient \(\rho\), let \(\rho_{i}\) (\(i=1\), 2, 3, \(\ldots\) ) denote the theoretical or long-run autocorrelation coefficients at the various lags. If all these \(\rho\)'s are zero, there is no (linear) relationship between observations in the series at _any_ lag. In this case, if \(n\) is large, each \(R_{i}\) has approximately a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation \(1/\sqrt{n}\) and different \(R_{i}\)'s are almost independent. Thus \(H_{0}\): \(\rho_{i}=0\) can be rejected at a significance level of approximately.05 if either \(r_{i}\geqslant 2/\sqrt{n}\) or \(r_{i}\leqslant-2/\sqrt{n}\). If \(n=100\) and \(r_{1}=.16\), \(r_{2}=-.09\), \(r_{3}=-.15\), is there evidence of theoretical autocorrelation at any of the first three lags? **d.**: If you are testing the null hypothesis in (c) for more than one lag, why might you want to increase the cutoff constant 2 in the rejection region? [_Hint_: What about the probability of committing at least one type I error?]

### 12.6 Assessing Model Adequacy

A plot of the observed pairs (\(x_{i}\), \(y_{i}\)) is a necessary first step in deciding on the form of a mathematical relationship between \(x\) and \(y\). It is possible to fit many functions other than a linear one (\(y=b_{0}+b_{1}x\)) to the data, using either the principle of least squares or another fitting method. Once a function of the chosen form has been fitted, it is important to check the fit of the model to see whether it is in fact appropriate. One way to study the fit is to superimpose a graph of the best-fit function on the scatter plot of the data. However, any tilt or curvature of the best-fit function may obscure some aspects of the fit that should be investigated. Furthermore, the scale on the vertical axis may make it difficult to assess the extent to which observed values deviate from the best-fit functions.

### 12.7 Residuals and Standardized Residuals

A more effective approach to assessment of model adequacy is to compute the fitted or predicted values \(\hat{y}_{i}\) and the residuals \(e_{i}=y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\) and then plot various functions of these computed quantities. We then examine the plots either to confirm our choice of model or for indications that the model is not appropriate. Suppose the simple linear regression model is correct, and let \(y=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x\) be the equation of the estimated regression line. Then the \(i\)th residual is \(e_{i}=y_{i}-(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i})\). To derive properties of the residuals, let \(e_{i}=Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i}\) represent the \(i\)th residual as a random variable (rv) (before observations are actually made). Then

\[E(Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i})=E(Y_{i})-E(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i})=\beta_{0} +\beta_{1}x_{i}-(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{i})=0 \tag{12.12}\]

Because \(\hat{Y}_{i}(=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i})\) is a linear function of the \(Y_{j}\)'s, so is \(Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i}\) (the coefficients depend on the \(x_{j}\)'s). Thus the normality of the \(Y_{j}\)'s implies that each residual is normally distributed. It can also be shown (Exercise 76) that \[V(Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i})=\sigma^{2}\left[1-\frac{1}{n}-\frac{(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}} {S_{xx}}\right] \tag{12.13}\]

Replacing \(\sigma^{2}\) by \(s^{2}\) and taking the square root of Equation (12.13) gives the estimated standard deviation of a residual.

Let's now standardize each residual by subtracting the mean value (zero) and then dividing by the estimated standard deviation.

The **standardized residuals** are given by

\[e_{i}^{*}=\frac{y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}}{s\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{n}-\frac{(x_{i}-\overline {x})^{2}}{S_{xx}}}}\hskip 28.452756pti=1,\ldots,n \tag{12.14}\]

Notice that the variances of the residuals differ from one another. If \(n\) is reasonably large, though, the bracketed term in (12.13) will be approximately 1, so some sources use \(e_{i}\)/\(s\) as the standardized residual. Computation of the \(e_{i}\)*'s can be tedious, but the most widely used statistical computer packages automatically provide these values and (upon request) can construct various plots involving them.

Example 12.12 presented data on \(x=\) average SAT for entering freshmen and \(y=\) six-year percentage graduation rate. Here we reproduce the data along with the fitted values and their estimated standard deviations, residuals and their estimated standard deviations, and standardized residuals. The estimated regression line is \(y=-36.18+.08855x\), and \(r^{2}=.729\). Notice that estimated standard deviations of the residuals (in the \(s_{e}\) column) differ somewhat, so \(e\)* \(\neq\)\(e\)/\(s\). The standard deviations of the residuals are higher near \(\overline{x}\), in contrast to the standard deviations of the predicted values, which are lower near \(\overline{x}\).

### Diagnostic Plots

The basic plots that many statisticians recommend for an assessment of model validity and usefulness are the following:

1. \(y_{i}\) on the vertical axis versus \(x_{i}\) on the horizontal axis
2. \(y_{i}\) on the vertical axis versus \(\hat{y}_{i}\) on the horizontal axis
3. \(e_{i}\)* (or \(e_{i}\)) on the vertical axis versus \(x_{i}\) on the horizontal axis
4. \(e_{i}\)* (or \(e_{i}\)) on the vertical axis versus \(\hat{y}_{i}\) on the horizontal axis
5. A normal probability plot of the standardized residuals (or residuals)

Plots 3 and 4 are called **residual plots** against the independent variable and fitted (predicted) values, respectively.

If Plot 2 yields points close to the 45\({}^{\circ}\) line [slope +1 through (0, 0)], then the estimated regression function gives accurate predictions of the values actually observed. Thus Plot 2 provides a visual assessment of model effectiveness in making predictions. Provided that the model is correct, neither residual plot should exhibit distinct patterns. The residuals should be randomly distributed about 0 according to a normal distribution, so all but a very few standardized residuals should lie between \(-2\) and +2 (i.e., all but a few residuals within 2 standard deviations of their expected value 0). The plot of standardized residuals versus \(\hat{y}\) is really a combination of the two other plots, showing implicitly both how residuals vary with \(x\) and how fitted values compare with observed values. This latter plot is the single one most often recommended for multiple regression analysis. Plot 5 allows the analyst to assess the plausibility of the assumption that \(\varepsilon\) has a normal distribution.

Figure 12.27 presents the five plots just recommended along with a sixth plot. The plot of \(y\) versus \(\hat{y}\) confirms the impression given by \(r^{2}\) that \(x\) is fairly effective in predicting \(y\). The residual plots show no unusual pattern or discrepant values. The normal probability plot of the standardized residuals is quite straight. In summary, the first five plots leave us with no qualms about either the appropriateness of a simple linear relationship or the fit to the given data.

Notice that plotting against \(x\) yields the same shape as a plot against the predicted values. Is this surprising? The predicted value is a linear function of \(x\), so the plots will have the same appearance. Given that the plots look the same, why include both? This is preparation for the next section, where more than one predictor is allowed, and plotting against \(x\) is not the same as plotting against the predicted values.

The sixth plot in Figure 12.27 is in accord with what was found graphically in Example 12.12. In that example, Figure 12.18 showed that private universities might tend to have better graduation rates than state universities. For another graphical view of this, we show in the last plot of Figure 12.27 the standardized residuals plotted against a variable that is 0 for state universities and 1 for private universities. In this graph the private universities do seem to have an advantage, but we will need to wait until the next section for a hypothesis test, which requires including this new variable as a second predictor in the model.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11950]

Figure 12.28 presents residual plots corresponding to items 1-3, 5, and 6. In Chapter 4, we discussed patterns in normal probability plots that cast doubt on the assumption of an underlying normal distribution. Notice that the residuals from the data in Figure 12.28d with the circled point included would not by themselves necessarily suggest further analysis, yet when a new line is fit with that point deleted, the new line differs considerably from the original line. This type of behavior is more difficult to identify in multiple regression. It is most likely to arise when there is a single (or very few) data point(s) with independent variable value(s) far removed from the remainder of the data.

We now indicate briefly what remedies are available for the types of difficulties. For a more comprehensive discussion, one or more of the references on regression analysis should be consulted. If the residual plot looks something like that of Figure 12.28a, exhibiting a curved pattern, then a nonlinear function of \(x\) may be fit.

The residual plot of Figure 12.28b suggests that, although a straight-line relationship may be reasonable, the assumption that \(V(Y_{i})=\sigma^{2}\) for each \(i\) is of doubtful validity. When the error term \(\varepsilon\) satisfies the independence and constant variance assumptions (normality is not needed) for the simple linear regression

Figure 12.28: Plots that indicate abnormality in data: (a) nonlinear relationship; (b) non-constant variance; (c) discrepant observation; (d) observation with large influence; (e) dependence in errors; (f) variable omitted

model of Section 12.1, it can be shown that among all unbiased estimators of \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\), the ordinary least squares estimators have minimum variance. These estimators give equal weight to each \((x_{i},Y_{i})\). If the variance of \(Y\) increases with \(x\), then \(Y_{i}\)'s for large \(x_{i}\) should be given less weight than those with small \(x_{i}\). This suggests that \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) should be estimated by minimizing \[f_{w}(b_{0},b_{1})=\sum w_{i}[y_{i}-(b_{0}+b_{1}x_{i})]^{2}\] where the \(w_{i}\)'s are weights that decrease with increasing \(x_{i}\). Minimization of Expression (12.15) yields **weighted least squares** estimates. For example, if the standard deviation of \(Y\) is proportional to \(x\) (for \(x>0\))--that is, \(V(Y)=kx^{2}\)--then it can be shown that the weights \(w_{i}=1/x_{i}^{2}\) yield minimum variance estimators of \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\). The books by Michael Kutner et al. and by S. Chatterjee et al. contain more detail (see the chapter bibliography). Weighted least squares is used quite frequently by econometricians (economists who use statistical methods) to estimate parameters.

When plots or other evidence suggest that the data set contains outliers or points having large influence on the resulting fit, one possible approach is to omit these outlying points and recompute the estimated regression equation. This would certainly be correct if it were found that the outliers resulted from errors in recording data values or experimental errors. If no assignable cause can be found for the outliers, it is still desirable to report the estimated equation both with and without outliers. Yet another approach is to retain possible outliers but to use an estimation principle that puts relatively less weight on outlying values than does the principle of least squares. One such principle is MAD (minimize absolute deviations), which selects \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) to minimize \(\sum|y_{i}-(b_{0}+b_{1}x_{i})|\). Unlike the estimates of least squares, there are no nice formulas for the MAD estimates; their values must be found by using an iterative computational procedure. Such procedures are also used when it is suspected that the \(\varepsilon_{i}\)'s have a distribution that is not normal but instead has "heavy tails" (making it much more likely than for the normal distribution that discrepant values will enter the sample); robust regression procedures are those that produce reliable estimates for a wide variety of underlying error distributions. Least squares estimators are not robust in the same way that the sample mean \(\overline{X}\) is not a robust estimator for \(\mu\).

When a plot suggests time dependence in the error terms, an appropriate analysis may involve a transformation of the \(y\)'s or else a model explicitly including a time variable. Lastly, a plot such as that of Figure 12.28f, which shows a pattern in the residuals when plotted against an omitted variable, suggests considering a model that includes the omitted variable. We have already seen an illustration of this in Example 12.24.

The accompanying data was read from a graph in the paper.

The summary statistics provide no way of distinguishing among the four data sets. Based on a scatter plot and a residual plot for each set, comment on the appropriateness or inappropriateness of fitting a straight-line model; include in your comments any specific suggestions for how a "straight-line analysis" might be modified or qualified.

Then use rules of variance to verify that \(V(Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i})\) is given by Expression (12.13). **b.**: As \(x_{i}\) moves farther away from \(\overline{x}\), what happens to \(V(\hat{Y}_{i})\) and to \(V(Y_{i}-\hat{Y}_{i})\)?

\(H_{\text{a}}\): \(H_{0}\) is not true (the true regression function is not linear)

Suppose observations are made at \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{c}\). Let \(Y_{11},Y_{12},\ldots,Y_{1n_{1}}\) denote the \(n_{1}\) observations when \(x=x_{1}\); \(\ldots\); \(Y_{c1},Y_{c2},\ldots,Y_{cn_{k}}\) denote the \(n_{c}\) observations when \(x=x_{c}\). With \(n=\Sigma n_{i}\) (the total number of observations), SSE has \(n-2\) df. We break SSE into two pieces, SSPE (pure error) and SSLF (lack of fit), as follows:

\[\text{SSPE} = \sum_{i}\sum_{j}\left(Y_{ij}-\overline{Y}_{i}\right)^{2}\] \[= \sum_{i}\sum_{j}Y_{ij}^{2}-\sum_{i}n_{i}(\overline{Y}_{i})^{2}\] \[\text{SSLF} = \text{SSE}-\text{SSPE}\]

The \(n_{i}\) observations at \(x_{i}\) contribute \(n_{i}-1\) df to SSPE, so the number of degrees of freedom for SSPE is \(\Sigma_{i}(n_{i}-1)=n-c\) and the degrees of freedom for SSLF is \(n-2-(n-c)=c-2\). Let \(\text{MSPE}=\text{SSPE}/(n-c)\), \(\text{MSLF}=\text{SSLF}/(c-2)\). Then it can be shown that whereas \(E(\text{MSPE})=\sigma^{2}\) whether or not \(H_{0}\) is true, \(E(\text{MSLF})=\sigma^{2}\) if \(H_{0}\) is true and \(E(\text{MSLF})>\sigma^{2}\) if \(H_{0}\) is false.

### 2.7 Multiple Regression Analysis

In multiple regression, the objective is to build a probabilistic model that relates a dependent variable \(y\) to more than one independent or predictor variable. Let \(k\) represent the number of predictor variables (\(k\geq 2\)) and denote these predictors by \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{k}\). For example, in attempting to predict the selling price of a house, we might have \(k=3\) with \(x_{1}=\) size (ft2), \(x_{2}=\) age (years), and \(x_{3}=\) number of rooms.

\(\begin{array}{ll}\mbox{DEFINITION}&\mbox{The {general additive multiple regression model equation} is}\\ &Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+\beta_{k}x_{k}+ \varepsilon\end{array}\) (12.16)

where \(E(\varepsilon)=0\) and \(V(\varepsilon)=\sigma^{2}\). In addition, for purposes of testing hypotheses and calculating CIs or PIs, it is assumed that \(\varepsilon\) is normally distributed and also that the \(\varepsilon\)'s associated with various observations, and thus the \(Y_{i}\)'s themselves, are independent of one another.

Let \(x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}\) be particular values of \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{k}\). Then (12.16) implies that

\[\mu_{Y\cdot x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}^{*} +\cdots+\beta_{k}x_{k}^{*} \tag{12.17}\]

Thus, just as \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x\) describes the mean \(Y\) value as a function of \(x\) in simple linear regression, the **true** (or **population**) **regression function**\(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\cdots+\beta_{k}x_{k}\) gives the expected value of \(Y\) as a function of \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{k}\). The \(\beta_{i}\)'s are the **true** (or **population**) **regression coefficients**. The regression coefficient \(\beta_{1}\) is interpreted as the expected change in \(Y\) associated with a 1-unit increase in \(x_{1}\)_while_\(x_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{k}\)_are held fixed_. Analogous interpretations hold for \(\beta_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\beta_{k}\).

### 2.8 Estimating Parameters

The data in simple linear regression consists of \(n\) pairs \((x_{1},y_{1})\), \(\ldots\), \((x_{n},y_{n})\). Suppose that a multiple regression model contains two predictor variables, \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\). Then each observation will consist of three numbers (a triple): a value of \(x_{1}\), a value of \(x_{2}\), and a value of \(y\). More generally, with \(k\) independent or predictor variables, each observation will consist of \(k+1\) numbers (a "\(k+1\) tuple"). The values of the predictors in the individual observations are denoted using double-subscripting:

\[x_{ij} = \text{the value of the }j\text{th predictor }x_{j}\text{ in the }i\text{th observation}\] \[(i=1,\ \ldots,\ n;\ j=1,\ \ldots\,\ k).\]

Thus the first subscript is the observation number and the second subscript is the predictor number. For example, \(x_{83}\) is the value of the 3rd predictor in the 8th observation (to avoid confusion, a comma can be inserted between the two subscripts, e.g. \(x_{12,3}\)). The first observation in our data set is then (\(x_{11},x_{12},\ldots,x_{1k},y_{1}\)), the second is (\(x_{21},x_{22},\ldots,x_{2k},y_{2}\)), and so on.

Consider candidates \(b_{0}\), \(b_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(b_{k}\) for estimates of the \(\beta_{i}\)'s and the corresponding candidate regression function \(b_{0}+b_{1}x_{1}+\cdots+b_{k}x_{k}\). Substituting the predictor values for any individual observation into this candidate function gives a prediction for the \(y\) value that would be observed, and subtracting this prediction from the actual observed \(y\) value gives the prediction error. The **principle of least squares** says we should square these prediction errors, sum, and then take as the least squares estimates \(\hat{\beta}_{0},\hat{\beta}_{1},\ldots,\hat{\beta}_{k}\), the values of the \(b_{j}\)'s that minimize the sum of squared prediction errors. To carry out this program, form the criterion function (sum of squared prediction errors)

\[g(b_{0},b_{1},\ldots,b_{k})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[y_{i}-(b_{0}+b_{1}x_{i1}+ \cdots+b_{k}x_{ik})\right]^{2}\]

and then take the partial derivative of \(g(\cdot)\) with respect to each \(b_{j}\) (\(j=0,\,1,\ldots,k\)), and equate these \(k+1\) partial derivatives to \(0\). The result is a system of \(k+1\) equations, the **normal equations**, in the \(k+1\) unknowns (the \(b_{j}\)'s). It is very important here that the normal equations are linear in the unknowns because the criterion function is quadratic.

\[nb_{0}+\left(\sum x_{i1}\right)b_{1}+\left(\sum x_{i2}\right)b_{2}+\cdots+ \left(\sum x_{ik}\right)b_{k}=\sum y_{i}\] \[\left(\sum x_{i1}\right)b_{0}+\left(\sum x_{i1}^{2}\right)b_{1}+ \left(\sum x_{i1}x_{i2}\right)b_{2}+\cdots+\left(\sum x_{i1}x_{ik}\right)b_{k }=\sum x_{i1}y_{i}\] \[\vdots\] \[\left(\sum x_{ik}\right)b_{0}+\left(\sum x_{i1}x_{ik}\right)b_{1} +\cdots+\left(\sum x_{i,k-1}x_{ik}\right)b_{k-1}+\left(\sum x_{ik}^{2}\right) b_{k}=\sum x_{ik}y_{i}\]

We will assume that the system has a unique solution, the least squares estimates \(\hat{\beta}_{0},\,\hat{\beta}_{1},\,\hat{\beta}_{2},\ \ldots,\hat{\beta}_{k}\). The next section uses matrix algebra to deal with the system of equations and develop inferential procedures for multiple regression. For the moment, though, we shall take advantage of the fact that all of the commonly used statistical software packages are programmed to solve the equations and provide the results needed for inference.

Sometimes interest in the individual regression coefficients is the main reason for doing the regression. The article "Autoregressive Modeling of Baseball Performance and Salary Data," _Proceedings of the Statistical Graphics Section, American Statistical Association_, 1988, 132-137, describes a multiple regression of runs scored as a function of singles, doubles, triples, home runs, and walks (combined with hit-by-pitcher). The estimated regression equation is \[\text{runs} = -2.49 +.47\text{ singles} +.76\text{ doubles} + 1.14\text{ triples} + 1.54\text{ home runs} +.39\text{ walks}\]

This is very similar to the popular slugging percentage statistic, which gives weight 1 to singles, 2 to doubles, 3 to triples, and 4 to home runs. However, the slugging percentage gives no weight to walks, whereas the regression puts weight.39 on walks, more than 80% of the weight it assigns to singles. The importance of walks is well-known among statisticians who follow baseball, and it is interesting that there are now some statistically savvy people in major league baseball management who are emphasizing walks in choosing players.

The article "Factors Affecting Achievement in the First Course in Calculus" (_J. Exper. Educ._, 1984: 136-140) discussed the ability of several variables to predict \(y=\) freshman calculus grade (on a scale of 0-100). The variables included \(x_{1}=\) an algebra placement test given in the first week of class, \(x_{2}=\) ACT math score, \(x_{3}=\) ACT natural science score, and \(x_{4}=\) high school percentile rank. Here are the scores for the first five and the last five of the 80 students (the data set is available from the website for this book):

\[\hat{\beta}_{0}=36.12\quad\hat{\beta}_{1}=.9610\quad\hat{\beta}_{2}=.2718 \quad\hat{\beta}_{3}=.2161\quad\hat{\beta}_{4}=.1353\]

Thus we estimate that.9610 is the average increase in final grade associated with a 1-point increase in the algebra placement score when the other three predictors are held fixed. Another way to interpret this is to say that a 10-point increase in the algebra pretest score, with the other scores held fixed, corresponds to a 9.6 point increase in the final grade, an increase of approximately one letter grade if \(\text{A}=90\)s, \(\text{B}=80\)s, etc. The other estimated coefficients are interpreted in a similar manner.

The estimated regression equation is

\[y=36.12+.9610x_{1}+.2718x_{2}+.2161x_{3}+.1353x_{4}.\]

A point prediction of final grade for a single student with an algebra test score of 25, ACTM score of 28, ACTNS score of 26, and a high school percentile rank of 90 is

\[\hat{y}=36.12+.9610(25)+.2718(28)+.2161(26)+.1353(90)=85.55\]a middle B. This is also a point estimate of the mean for the population of all students with an algebra test score of 25, ACTM score of 28, ACTNS score of 26, and a high school percentile rank of 90 \(\blacksquare\)

### \(\hat{\sigma}^{2}\) and the Coefficient of Multiple Determination

Substituting the values of the predictors from the successive observations into the equation for an estimated regression function gives the **predicted** or **fitted values**\(\hat{y}_{1},\hat{y}_{2},\ldots,\hat{y}_{n}\). For example, since the values of the four predictors for the last observation in Example 12.25 are 21, 28, 30, and 99, respectively, the corresponding predicted value is \(\hat{y}_{80}=83.79\). The **residuals** are the differences \(y_{1}-\hat{y}_{1},\ldots,y_{n}-\hat{y}_{n}\). In simple linear regression, they were the vertical deviations from the least squares line, but in general there is no geometric interpretation in multiple regression (the exception is the case \(k=2\), where the estimated regression function specifies a plane in three dimensions and the residuals are the vertical deviations from the plane). The last residual in Example 12.25 is \(85-83.79=1.21\). The closer the residuals are to 0, the better the job our estimated equation is doing in predicting the \(y\) values actually observed.

The residuals are sometimes important not just for judging the quality of a regression. Several enterprising students developed a multiple regression model using age, size in square feet, etc. to predict the price of four-unit apartment buildings. They found that one building had a strongly negative residual, meaning that the price was much lower than predicted. As it turned out, the reason was that the owner had "cash-flow" problems, and needed to sell quickly, so the students got an unusually good deal.

As in simple linear regression, the estimate of the variance parameter \(\sigma^{2}\) is based on the sum of squared residuals (or sum of squared errors) SSE = \(\Sigma(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i})^{2}\). Previously, we divided SSE by \(n-2\) to obtain the estimate. The explanation was that the two parameters \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) had to be estimated, entailing a loss of two degrees of freedom. For each parameter there is a normal equation that can be expressed as a constraint on the residuals, with a loss of 1 df. In multiple regression with \(k\) predictors, \(k+1\) df are lost in estimating the \(\hat{\beta}_{i}\)'s (don't forget the constant term \(\beta_{0}\)). Here are the normal equations rewritten as constraints on the residuals:

\[\sum\left[y_{i}-(b_{0}+x_{i1}b_{1}+x_{i2}b_{2}+\cdots+x_{ik}b_{k})\right] = 0\] \[\sum x_{i1}[y_{i}-(b_{0}+x_{i1}b_{1}+x_{i2}b_{2}+\cdots+x_{ik}b_{k })] = 0\] \[\vdots\] \[\sum x_{ik}[y_{i}-(b_{0}+x_{i1}b_{1}+x_{i2}b_{2}+\cdots+x_{ik}b_{k })] = 0\]

The first equation says that the sum of the residuals is 0, the second equation says that the first predictor times the residual sums to 0, etc. These \(k+1\) constraints allow any \(k+1\) residuals to be determined from the others. This implies that SSE is based on \(n-(k+1)\) df and this is the divisor in the estimate of \(\sigma^{2}\):

\[\hat{\sigma}^{2}=s^{2}=\frac{\text{SSE}}{n-(k+1)}=\text{MSE},\quad\hat{\sigma} =s=\sqrt{s^{2}}\]SSE can once again be regarded as a measure of unexplained variation in the data--the extent to which observed variation in \(y\) cannot be attributed to the model relationship. Total sum of squares SST, defined as \(\sum{(y_{i}-\overline{y})}^{2}\) as in simple linear regression, is a measure of total variation in the observed \(y\) values. Taking the ratio of these sums of squares and subtracting from one gives the **coefficient of multiple determination**

\[R^{2}=1-\frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}}\]

Sometimes called just the **coefficient of determination** or the **squared multiple correlation**, \(R^{2}\) is interpreted as the proportion of observed variation that can be attributed to, or equivalently, explained by, the model relationship. Thinking of SST as the error sum of squares using just the constant model (with \(\beta_{0}\) as the only term in the model) having \(\overline{y}\) as the predictor, \(R^{2}\) is the proportion by which the model reduces the error sum of squares. For example, if SST = 20 and SSE = 5, then the model reduces the error sum of squares by 75%, so \(R^{2}=.75\). The closer \(R^{2}\) is to 1, the greater the proportion of observed variation that can be explained by the fitted model.

Unfortunately, there is a potential problem with \(R^{2}\): its value can be inflated by including predictors in the model that are relatively unimportant or even frivolous. For example, suppose we plan to obtain a sample of 20 recently sold houses in order to relate sale price to various characteristics of a house. Natural predictors include interior size, lot size, age, number of bedrooms, and distance to the nearest school. Suppose we also include in the model the diameter of the doorknob on the door of the master bedroom, the height of the toilet bowl in the master bath, and so on until we have 19 predictors. Then unless we are extremely unlucky in our choice of predictors, the value of \(R^{2}\) will be 1 (because 20 coefficients are estimated from 20 observations)! Rather than seeking a model that has the highest possible \(R^{2}\) value, which can be achieved just by "packing" our model with predictors, what is desired is a relatively simple model based on just a few important predictors whose \(R^{2}\) value is high.

It is therefore desirable to adjust \(R^{2}\) to take account of the fact that its value may be quite high just because many predictors were used relative to the amount of data. The **adjusted coefficient of multiple determination** is defined by

\[R_{\text{a}}^{2}=1-\frac{\text{MSE}}{\text{MST}}=1-\frac{\text{SSE}/[n-(k+1)] }{\text{SST}/(n-1)}=1-\frac{n-1}{n-(k+1)}\frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}}\]

The ratio multiplying SSE/SST in adjusted \(R^{2}\) exceeds 1 (the denominator is smaller than the numerator), so adjusted \(R^{2}\) is smaller than \(R^{2}\) itself, and in fact will be much smaller when \(k\) is large relative to \(n\). A value of \(R_{\text{a}}^{2}\) much smaller than \(R^{2}\) is a warning flag that the chosen model has too many predictors relative to the amount of data.

Continuing with the previous example in which a model with four predictors was fit to the calculus data consisting of 80 observations, the JMP software package gave \(\text{SSE}=7346.05\) and SST = 10,332.20, from which \(s=9.90\), \(R^{2}=.289\), and \(R_{\text{a}}^{2}=.251\). The estimated standard deviation \(s\) is very close to 10, which corresponds to one letter grade on the usual A = 90s, B = 80s, \(\ldots\), scale. About 29% of observed variation in grade can be attributed to the chosen model. The difference between \(R^{2}\) and \(R_{\rm a}^{\rm 2}\) is not very dramatic, a reflection of the fact that \(k=4\) is much smaller than \(n=80\). \(\blacksquare\)

### A Model Utility Test

In multiple regression, is there a single indicator that can be used to judge whether a particular model will be useful? The value of \(R^{2}\) certainly communicates a preliminary message, but this value is sometimes deceptive because it can be greatly inflated by using a large number of predictors (large \(k\)) relative to the sample size \(n\) (this is the rationale behind adjusting \(R^{2}\)).

The model utility test in simple linear regression involved the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\), according to which there is no useful relation between \(y\) and the single predictor \(x\). Here we consider the assertion that \(\beta_{1}=0\), \(\beta_{2}=0\),..., \(\beta_{k}=0\), which says that there is no useful relationship between \(y\) and \(any\) of the \(k\) predictors. If at least one of these \(\beta\)'s is not 0, the corresponding predictor(s) is (are) useful. The test is based on a statistic that has a particular \(F\) distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true (see Sections 10.5 and 11.1 for more about \(F\) tests).

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=\cdots=\beta_{k}=0\) \\ Alternative hypothesis: \(H_{\rm a}\): at least one \(\beta_{i}\neq 0\) (\(i=1,\ldots,k\)) \\ Test statistic value: \\ \(f=\frac{R^{2}/k}{(1-R^{2})/[n-(k+1)]}=\frac{\text{SSR}/k}{\text{SSE}/[n-(k+1)]} =\frac{\text{MSR}}{\text{MSE}}\) \\ where \(\text{SSR}=\text{regression sum of squares }=\text{SST}-\text{SSE}\) \\ Rejection region for a level \(\alpha\) test: \(f\geq F_{\alpha,k,n-(k+1)}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

See the next section for an explanation of why the ratio MSR/MSE has an \(F\) distribution under the null hypothesis.

Except for a constant multiple, the test statistic here is \(R^{2}/(1-R^{2})\), the ratio of explained to unexplained variation. If the proportion of explained variation is high relative to unexplained, we would naturally want to reject \(H_{0}\) and confirm the utility of the model. However, the factor \([n-(k+1)]/k\) decreases as \(k\) increases, and if \(k\) is large relative to \(n\), it will reduce \(f\) considerably.

Returning to the calculus data of Example 12.25, a model with \(k=4\) predictors was fitted, so the relevant hypotheses are

\(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=\beta_{2}=\beta_{3}=\beta_{4}=0\) \\ \(H_{\rm a}\): at least one of these four \(\beta\)'s is not 0 \\ \end{tabular}

Figure 12.29 shows output from the JMP statistical package. The values of \(s\) (Root Mean Square Error), \(R^{2}\), and adjusted \(R^{2}\) certainly suggest a useful model. The value of the model utility \(F\) ratio is

\[f=\frac{R^{2}/k}{(1-R^{2})/[n-(k+1)]}=\frac{.289/4}{.711/(80-5)}=7.62\]This value also appears in the F Ratio column of the ANOVA table in Figure 12.29. Since \(f=7.62\geq F.01.4,75\approx 3.6\), \(H_{0}\) should be rejected at significance level.01. In fact, the ANOVA table in the JMP output shows that \(P\)-value \(<.0001\). The null hypothesis should therefore be rejected at any reasonable significance level. We conclude that there _is_ a useful linear relationship between \(y\) and _at least one_ of the four predictors in the model. This does not mean that all four predictors are useful; we will say more about this subsequently.

### 12.27 Inferences in Multiple Regression

Before testing hypotheses, constructing CIs, and making predictions, one should first examine diagnostic plots to see whether the model needs modification or whether there are outliers in the data. The recommended plots are (standardized) residuals versus each independent variable, residuals versus \(\hat{y}\), \(y\) versus \(\hat{y}\), and a normal probability plot of the standardized residuals. Potential problems are suggested by the same patterns discussed in Section 12.6. Of particular importance is the identification of observations that have a large influence on the fit.

Because each \(\hat{\beta}_{i}\) is a linear function of the \(y_{i}\)'s, the standard deviation of each \(\hat{\beta}_{i}\) is the product of \(\sigma\) and a function of the \(x_{ij}\)'s, so an estimate \(\hat{y}_{i}\) is obtained by substituting \(s\) for \(\sigma\). A formula for \(\hat{y}_{i,i}\) is given in the next section, and the result is part of the output from all standard regression computer packages. Inferences concerning a single \(\hat{\beta}_{i}\) are based on the standardized variable

\[T=\frac{\hat{\beta}_{i}-\beta_{i}}{\hat{S}_{\hat{y}_{i}}}\]

which, assuming the model is correct, has a \(t\) distribution with \(n-(k+1)\) df.

The point estimate of \(\mu_{Y\cdot x_{1}^{*},\ldots,x_{s}^{*}}\), the expected value of \(Y\) when \(x_{1}=x_{1}^{*},\ \ldots,x_{k}=x_{k}^{*}\), is \(\hat{\mu}_{Y\cdot x_{1}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x _{1}^{*}+\cdots+\hat{\beta}_{k}x_{k}^{*}\). The estimated standard deviation of the corresponding estimator is a complicated expression involving the

Figure 12.29: Multiple regression output from JMP for the data of Example 12.27

sample \(x_{ij}\)'s, but a simple matrix formula is given in the next section. The better statistical computer packages will calculate it on request. Inferences about \(\mu_{Y:x_{1}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}}\) are based on standardizing its estimator to obtain a \(t\) variable having \(n-(k+1)\)df.

1. A \(100(1-\alpha)\)% CI for \(\beta_{i}\), the coefficient of \(x_{i}\) in the regression function, is \[\hat{\beta}_{i}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-(k+1)}\cdot\widehat{\mathfrak{F}}_{i}\]
2. A test for \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{i}=\beta_{i0}\) uses the test statistic value \(t=(\hat{\beta}_{i}-\beta_{i0})/_{\widehat{\mathfrak{F}}_{i}}\) based on \(n-(k+1)\)df. The test is upper-, lower-, or two-tailed according to whether \(H_{\text{a}}\) contains the inequality \(>\), \(<\), or \(\neq\).
3. A \(100(1-\alpha)\)% CI for \(\mu_{Y:x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}}\) is \[\hat{\mu}_{Y:x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-(k+1)} \cdot(\text{estimated SD of }\hat{\mu}_{Y:x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}})= \hat{y}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-(k+1)}\cdot s\hat{y}\] where \(\hat{Y}\) is the statistic \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x_{1}^{*}+\cdots+\hat{\beta}_{k}x_{k}^{*}\) and \(\hat{y}\) is the calculated value of \(\hat{Y}\).
4. A \(100(1-\alpha)\)% PI for a future \(y\) value is \[\hat{\mu}_{Y:x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-(k+1)}\cdot[s^{2}+(\text{estimated SD of }\hat{\mu}_{Y:x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*},\ldots,x_{k}^{*}})^{2}]^{1/2}\] \[=\hat{y}\pm t_{\alpha/2,n-(k+1)}\cdot\sqrt{s^{2}+s_{\hat{Y}}^{2}}\] Simultaneous intervals for which the simultaneous confidence or prediction level is controlled can be obtained by applying the Bonferroni technique.

The JMP output for the calculus data includes 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients. Let's verify the interval for \(\beta_{1}\), the coefficient for algebra placement score:

\[\hat{\beta}_{1}\pm t_{.025,80-5}s_{\widehat{\mathfrak{F}}_{1}}=.961\pm 1.992(.264)=.961\pm.526=(.435,1.487)\]

which agrees with the interval given in Figure 29. Thus if ACTM score, ACTNS score, and percentile rank are fixed, we estimate an increase between.435 and 1.487 in grade is associated with a one-point increase in algebra score.

We found in Example 12.25 that, if a student has an algebra test score of 25, ACTM score of 28, ACTNS score of 26, and high school percentile rank of 90, then the predicted value is 85.55. The estimated standard deviation for this predicted value can be obtained from JMP, with the result \(s_{\hat{Y}}=1.882\), so a 95% confidence interval for the expected grade is

\[\hat{\mu}_{Y:25,28,26,90}\pm t_{.025,80-5}s_{\hat{Y}} =85.55\pm 1.992(1.882)\] \[=85.55\pm 3.75=(81.8,\ 89.3)\]

which can also be obtained from JMP. This interval is for the mean score of all students with the predictor values 25, 28, 26, and 90. Regarding scores in the 80's as B's, we can say with 95% confidence that the expected grade is a B. Nowconsider the estimated standard deviation for the error in predicting the final grade of a single student with the predictor values 25, 28, 26, and 90. This is

\[\sqrt{s^{2}+s_{\hat{Y}}^{2}}=\sqrt{9.897^{2}+1.882^{2}}=10.074\]

Therefore, a 95% prediction interval for the final grade of a single student with predictor scores 25, 28, 26, and 90 is

\[\hat{\mu}_{Y\cdot 25,28,26,90}\pm t_{.025,80-5}(10.074) =85.55\pm 1.992(10.074)=85.55\pm 20.07\] \[=(65.5,105.6)\]

Of course, this PI is much wider than the corresponding CI. Although we are highly confident that the expected score is a B, the score for a single student could be as low as a D or as high as an A. Notice that the upper end of the interval exceeds the maximum score of 100, so it would be appropriate to truncate the interval to (65.5, 100) 

Frequently, the hypothesis of interest has the form \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{i}=0\) for a particular \(i\). For example, after fitting the four-predictor model in Example 12.25, the investigator might wish to test \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{2}=0\). According to \(H_{0}\), as long as the predictors \(x_{1}\), \(x_{3}\), and \(x_{4}\) remain in the model, \(x_{2}\) contains no useful information about \(y\). The test statistic value is the **_t_-**ratio**\(\hat{\beta}_{i}/\hat{s}_{\hat{y}_{i}}\). Many statistical computer packages report the _t_-ratio and corresponding _P_-value for each predictor included in the model. For example, Figure 29 shows that as long as algebra pretest score, ACT natural science, and high school percentile rank are retained in the model, the predictor \(x_{2}=\) ACT math score can be deleted. The _P_-value for \(x_{2}\) is.55, much too large to reject the null hypothesis.

It is interesting to look at the correlations between the predictors and the response variable in Example 12.25. Here are the correlations and the corresponding _P_-values (in parentheses):

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}&\text{algplc}&\text{ACTmath}&\text{ACTns}&\text{rank}\\ \text{calcgrade}&0.491&0.353&0.259&0.324\\ &(0.000)&(0.0013)&(0.020)&(0.003)\end{array}\]

Do these values seem inconsistent with the multiple regression results? There is a highly significant correlation between calculus grade and ACT math score, but in the multiple regression the ACT math score is redundant, not needed in the model. The idea is that ACT math score also has highly significant correlations with the other predictors, so much of its predictive ability is retained in the model when this variable is deleted. In order to be a statistically significant predictor in the multiple regression model, a variable must provide additional predictive ability beyond what is offered by the other predictors.

The \(R^{2}\) value for the calculus data is disappointing. Given the importance placed on predictors such as ACT scores and high school rank in college admissions and NCAA eligibility, we might expect that these scores would give better predictions.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11964]

Figure 12.31: Standardized residuals versus predictors for the calculus data

Figure 12.32: Diagnostic plots for the calculus data: (a) \(y\) versus \(\hat{y}\) (b) standardized residual versus \(\hat{y}\)

The corresponding population regression function \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x+\beta_{2}x^{2}\) is quadratic rather than linear, and gives the mean or expected value of \(Y\) for any particular \(x\).

So what does this have to do with multiple regression? Let's rewrite the quadratic model equation as follows:

\[Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\varepsilon\quad\text{where $x_{1}=x$ and $x_{2}=x^{2}$}\]

Now this looks exactly like a multiple regression equation with two predictors. You may object on the grounds that one of the predictors is a mathematical function of the other one. Appeal denied! It is not only legitimate for a predictor in a multiple regression model to be a function of one or more other predictors but often desirable in the sense that a model with such a predictor may be judged much more useful than the model without such a predictor. The message at the moment is that _quadratic regression is a special case of multiple regression_. Thus any software package capable of carrying out a multiple regression analysis can fit the quadratic regression model. The same is true of cubic regression and even higher-order polynomial models, although in practice very rarely are such higher-order predictors needed.

The interpretation of \(\beta_{i}\) given previously for the general multiple regression model is not legitimate in quadratic regression. This is because \(x_{2}=x^{2}\), so the value of \(x_{2}\) cannot be increased while \(x_{1}=x\) is held fixed. More generally, the interpretation of regression coefficients requires extra care when some predictor variables are mathematical functions of others.

### Models with Interaction

Suppose that an industrial chemist is interested in the relationship between product yield (y) from a certain reaction and two independent variables, \(x_{1}=\) reaction temperature and \(x_{2}=\) pressure at which the reaction is carried out. The chemist initially proposes the relationship

\[Y=1200+15x_{1}-35x_{2}+\varepsilon\]

for temperature values between 80 and 100 in combination with pressure values ranging from 50 to 70. The population regression function \(1200+15x_{1}-35x_{2}\) gives the mean \(y\) value for any particular values of the predictors. Consider this mean \(y\) value for three different particular temperature values:

\[x_{1} = 90:\text{mean $y$ value}=1200+15(90)-35x_{2}=2550-35x_{2}\] \[x_{1} = 95:\text{mean $y$ value}=2625-35x_{2}\] \[x_{1} = 100:\text{mean $y$ value}=2700-35x_{2}\]

Graphs of these three mean \(y\) value functions are shown in Figure 12.33a. Each graph is a straight line, and the three lines are parallel, each with a slope of \(-35\). Thus irrespective of the fixed value of temperature, the average change in yield associated with a 1-unit increase in pressure is \(-35\).

When pressure \(x_{2}\) increases, the decline in average yield should be more rapid for a high temperature than for a low temperature, so the chemist has reason to doubt the appropriateness of the proposed model. Rather than the lines being parallel, the line for a temperature of 100 should be steeper than the line for a temperature of 95, and that line in turn should be steeper than the line for \(x_{1}=90\)A model that has this property includes, in addition to predictors \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\), a third predictor variable, \(x_{3}=x_{1}x_{2}\). One such model is

\[Y=-4500+75x_{1}+60x_{2}-x_{1}x_{2}+\varepsilon\]

for which the population regression function is \(-4500\) + \(75x_{1}\) + \(60x_{2}-x_{1}x_{2}\). This gives

\[\begin{array}{ll}(\text{mean }y\text{ value when temperature is }100)=&-4500+(75)(100)+60x_{2}-100x_{2}\\ &=3000-40x_{2}\\ (\text{mean value when temperature is }95)=&2625-35x_{2}\\ (\text{mean value when temperature is }90)=&2250-30x_{2}\end{array}\]

These are graphed in Figure 12.33b, where it is clear that the three slopes are different. Now each different value of \(x_{1}\) yields a line with a different slope, so the average change in yield associated with a l-unit increase in \(x_{2}\) depends on the value of \(x_{1}\). When this is the case, the two variables are said to _interact_.

The general equation for a multiple regression model based on two independent variables \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) and also including an interaction predictor is

\[Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{3}+\varepsilon\quad \text{where }x_{3}=x_{1}x_{2}.\]

When \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) do interact, this model will usually give a much better fit to resulting data than would the no-interaction model. Failure to consider a model

Figure 12.33: Graphs of the mean \(y\) value for two different models: (a) 1200 + 15x\({}_{1}-35x_{2}\); (b) \(-4500\) + \(75x_{1}\) + \(60x_{2}-x_{1}x_{2}\)

with interaction too often leads an investigator to conclude incorrectly that the relationship between \(y\) and a set of independent variables is not very substantial.

In applied work, quadratic predictors \(x_{1}^{2}\) and \(x_{2}^{2}\) are often included to model a curved relationship. This leads to the **full quadratic** or **complete second-order model**

\[Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{1}x_{2}+\beta_{4}x_{1}^{2 }+\beta_{5}x_{2}^{2}+\varepsilon\]

This model replaces the straight lines of Figure 12.33 with parabolas (each one is the graph of the population regression function as \(x_{2}\) varies when \(x_{1}\) has a particular value).

Investigators carried out a study to see how various characteristics of concrete are influenced by \(x_{1}=\%\) limestone powder and \(x_{2}=\) water-cement ratio, resulting in the accompanying data ("Durability of Concrete with Addition of Limestone Powder," \(Mag.\ Concrete\ Res.\), 1996: 131-137).

Consider first compressive strength as the dependent variable \(y\). Fitting the first-order model results in

\[y=84.82+.1643x_{1}-79.67x_{2}\qquad\qquad\text{SSE}=72.25\ (\text{df}=6)\]

\[R^{2}=.741\quad R_{\text{a}}^{2}=.654\]

whereas including an interaction predictor gives

\[y=6.22+5.779x_{1}+51.33x_{2}-9.357x_{1}x_{2}\]

\[\text{SSE}=29.35\ (\text{df}=5)\quad R^{2}=.895\quad R_{\text{a}}^{2}=.831\]

Based on this latter fit, a prediction for compressive strength when % limestone \(=\) 14 and water-cement ratio \(=.60\) is

\[\hat{y}=6.22+5.779(14)+51.33(.60)-9.357(8.4)=39.32\]

Fitting the full quadratic relationship results in virtually no change in the \(R^{2}\) value. However, when the dependent variable is adsorbability, the following results are obtained: \(R^{2}=.747\) when just two predictors are used,.802 when the interaction predictor is added, and.889 when the five predictors for the full quadratic relationship are used.

### Models with Predictors for Categorical Variables

Thus far we have explicitly considered the inclusion of only quantitative (numerical) predictor variables in a multiple regression model. Using simple numerical coding, qualitative (categorical) variables, such as type of college (private or state) or type of wood (pine, oak, or walnut), can also be incorporated into a model. Let's first focus on the case of a dichotomous variable, one with just two possible categories--male or female, U.S. or foreign manufacture, and so on. With any such variable, we associate a **dummy** or **indicator variable**_x_ whose possible values 0 and 1 indicate which category is relevant for any particular observation.

Recall the graduation rate data introduced in Example 12.12 and plotted in Example 12.24. There it appeared that private universities might do better for a given SAT score. To test this we will use a model with \(y=\text{graduation rate},x_{2}=\text{average freshman SAT score}\), and \(x_{1}=\text{a variable defined to indicate private or public status}\). Define

\[x_{1}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1&\text{if the university is private}\\ 0&\text{if the university is public}\end{array}\right.\]

and consider the multiple regression model

\[Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\varepsilon.\]

The mean graduation rate depends on whether the university is public or private:

\[\text{mean graduation rate} = \beta_{0}+\beta_{2}x_{2}\] when

\[x_{1}=0\]

\[(\text{public})\] mean graduation rate

\[= \beta_{0}+\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}\] when

\[x_{1}=1\]

\[(\text{private})\]

Thus there are two parallel lines with vertical separation \(\beta_{1}\). as shown in Figure 12.34a. The coefficient \(\beta_{1}\) is the difference in mean graduation rates between private and public universities with SAT held fixed. If \(\beta_{1}>0\), then on average, for a given SAT, private universities will have a higher graduation rate.

Figure 12.34: Regression functions for models with one dummy variable (\(x_{1}\)) and one quantitative variable (\(x_{2}\)): (a) no interaction; (b) interactionA second possibility is a model with a product (interaction) term:

\[Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{1}x_{2}+\varepsilon.\]

Now the mean graduation rates for the two types of university are

\[\begin{array}{llll}\text{mean graduation rate}&=&\beta_{0}+\beta_{2}x_{2}& \text{when }x_{1}=0\ (\text{public})\\ \text{mean graduation rate}&=&\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}+(\beta_{2}+\beta_{3})x_{2}& \text{when }x_{1}=1\ (\text{private})\end{array}\]

Thus we have two lines where \(\beta_{1}\) is the difference in intercepts and \(\beta_{3}\) is the difference in slopes, as shown in Figure 12.34b. Unless \(\beta_{3}=0\), the lines will not be parallel and there will be interaction, which means that the separation between public and private universities depends on SAT.

The usual procedure is to test the interaction hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{3}=0\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\beta_{3}\neq 0\) first. If we do not reject \(H_{0}\) (no interaction) then we can use the parallel model to see if there is a separation (\(\beta_{1}\)) between lines. Of course, it does not make sense to estimate the difference between lines if the difference depends on \(x_{2}\), which is the case when there is interaction.

Figure 12.35 shows SAS output for these two tests. The coefficient for interaction has a \(P\)-value of 0.9062, so there is no reason to reject the null

Figure 12.35: SAS output for interaction model and parallel model

hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{3}=0\). Since we do not reject the hypothesis of no interaction, let's look at the results for the difference \(\beta_{1}\) in the model with two parallel lines. The variable Priv1_St0 is \(x_{2}\), the dummy variable with value 1 for private and 0 for state universities. The \(P\)-value for its coefficient is.0231, so we can reject the hypothesis that it is 0 at the.05 level. The value of the coefficient is 13.17, which means that a private university is estimated to have a graduation rate about 13 percentage points higher than a state university with the same freshman SAT. This is pretty large, especially in comparison with the coefficient for SAT, which is.06869. Dividing.06869 into\(\hat{\beta}_{1}=13.17\) gives 192, which means that it takes 192 points in SAT to make up the difference between private and public universities. To put it another way, a private university with freshman SAT of 1000 is estimated to have the same graduation rate as a state university with SAT of 1192.

You might think that the way to handle a three-category situation is to define a single numerical variable with coded values such as 0, 1, and 2 corresponding to the three categories. This is incorrect, because it imposes an ordering on the categories that is not necessarily implied by the problem context. The correct way to incorporate three categories is to define _two_ different dummy variables. Suppose, for example, that \(y\) is a score on a posttest taken after instruction, \(x_{1}\) is the score on an ability pretest taken before instruction, and that there are three methods of instruction in a mathematics unit (1) with symbols, (2) without symbols, and (3) a mixture with and without symbols. Then let

\[x_{2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1&\text{instruction method 1}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\qquad x_{3}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}1& \text{instruction method 2}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

For an individual taught with method 1, \(x_{2}=1\) and \(x_{3}=0\), whereas for an individual taught with method 2, \(x_{2}=0\) and \(x_{3}=1\). For an individual taught with method 3, \(x_{2}=x_{3}=0\), and it is not possible that \(x_{2}=x_{3}=1\) because an individual cannot be taught simultaneously by both methods 1 and 2. The no-interaction model would have only the predictors \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\), and \(x_{3}\). The following interaction model allows the mean change in lifetime associated with a 1-unit increase in pretest to depend on the method of instruction:

\[Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\beta_{3}x_{3}+\beta_{4}x_{1}x_{2}+ \beta_{5}x_{1}x_{3}+\varepsilon\]

Construction of a picture like Figure 12.34 with a graph for each of the three possible (\(x_{2}\), \(x_{3}\)) pairs gives three nonparallel lines (unless \(\beta_{4}=\beta_{5}=0\)). How would we interpret statistically significant interaction? Suppose that it occurs to the extent that the lines for methods 1 and 2 cross. In particular, if the line for method 1 is higher on the right and lower on the left, it means that symbols work well for high ability students but not as well for low ability students.

More generally, incorporating a categorical variable with \(c\) possible categories into a multiple regression model requires the use of \(c-1\) indicator variables (e.g., five methods of instruction would necessitate using four indicator variables). Thus even one categorical variable can add many predictors to a model.

Indicator variables can be used for categorical variables without any other variables in the model. For example, consider Example 11.3, which compared three different compounds in their ability to prevent fabric soiling. Using a regression

* Given that mole contents and calcination temperature remain in the model, does the interaction predictor \(x_{3}\) provide useful information about \(y\)? State and test the appropriate hypotheses using a significance level of.01.
* The estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{Y}\) when mole contents is 2.0 and calcination temperature is 500 is \(s_{\hat{Y}}=4.69\). Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean value of surface area under these circumstances.

## 12.6 Regression with Matrices

In Section 12.7 we used an additive model equation to relate a dependent variable \(y\) to independent variables \(x\)1,..., \(x_{k}\). That is, we used the model

\[Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{1} + \beta_{2}x_{2} + \cdots + \beta_{k}x_{k} + \varepsilon,\]

where \(e\) is a random deviation or error term that is normally distributed with mean 0, variance \(s\)2, and the various _e_'s are independent of one another. Simple linear regression is the special case in which \(k\) = 1.

## The Normal Equations

Suppose that we have \(n\) observations, each consisting of a \(y\) value and values of the \(k\) predictors (so each observation consists of \(k\) + 1 numbers). We have then

\[\begin{bmatrix}y_{1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{n} \\ \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{11} + \beta_{2}x_{12} + \cdots + \beta_{k}x_{1k} + \varepsilon_{1} \\ \vdots \\ \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{n1} + \beta_{2}x_{n2} + \cdots + \beta_{k}x_{nk} + \varepsilon_{n} \\ \end{bmatrix}\]

For example, if there are \(n\) = 6 cars, where \(y\) is horsepower, \(x\)1 is engine size (liters), and \(x\)2 indicates fuel type (regular or premium), then we are trying to predict horsepower as a linear function of the \(k\) = 2 predictors engine size and fuel type. The equations can be written much more compactly using vectors and matrices. To do this, form a column vector of observations on \(y\), a column vector of regression coefficients, and a vector of random deviations:

\[\boldsymbol{y} = \begin{bmatrix}y_{1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{n} \\ \end{bmatrix}\quad\boldsymbol{\beta} = \begin{bmatrix} \beta_{0} \\ \beta_{1} \\ \vdots \\ \beta_{k} \\ \end{bmatrix}\quad\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \begin{bmatrix} \varepsilon_{1} \\ \vdots \\ \varepsilon_{n} \\ \end{bmatrix}\]Also form an \(n\times(k+1)\) matrix in which the first column consists of 1's (corresponding to the constant term in the model), the second column consists of the values of the first predictor \(x_{1}\) (i.e., of \(x_{11},x_{21},\ldots,x_{n1}\)), the third column has the values of \(x_{2}\), and so on.

\[\boldsymbol{X}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1&x_{11}&\ldots&x_{1k}\\ \vdots&\vdots&&\vdots\\ 1&x_{n1}&\ldots&x_{nk}\end{array}\right]\]

The \(\boldsymbol{X}\) matrix has a row for each observation, consisting of 1 and then the values of the \(k\) predictors. The equations relating the observed \(y\)'s to the \(x_{i}\)'s can then be written very concisely as

\[\left[\begin{array}{c}y_{1}\\ \vdots\\ y_{n}\end{array}\right]=\boldsymbol{y}=\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}+ \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}1&x_{11}&\ldots&x_{1k}\\ \vdots&\vdots&&\vdots\\ 1&x_{n1}&\ldots&x_{nk}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}\beta_{0}\\ \beta_{1}\\ \vdots\\ \beta_{k}\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}\varepsilon_{1}\\ \vdots\\ \varepsilon_{n}\end{array}\right]\]

We now estimate \(\beta_{0}\), \(\beta_{1}\), \(\beta_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(\beta_{k}\) using the principle of least squares: Find \(b_{0}\), \(b_{1}\), \(b_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(b_{k}\) to minimize

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[y_{i}-(b_{0}+b_{1}x_{i1}+b_{2}x_{i2}+\cdots+b_{k}x_{ik}) \right]^{2}=(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{b})^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{ y}-\boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{b})=\left\|\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{b}\right\|^{2}\]

where \(\boldsymbol{b}\) is the column vector with entries \(b_{0}\), \(b_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(b_{k}\), and \(\left\|\boldsymbol{u}\right\|\) is the length of \(\boldsymbol{u}\).

If we equate to zero the partial derivative with respect to each of the coefficients, then it leads to the normal equations:

\[b_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}1+b_{1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}+\cdots+b_{k}\sum _{i=1}^{n}x_{ik} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\] \[b_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}+b_{1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}x_{i1}+\cdots +b_{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}x_{ik} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}y_{i}\] \[\vdots\] \[b_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}+b_{1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}x_{i1}+\cdots +b_{k}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}x_{ik} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}y_{i}\]

In matrix form this is

\[\left[\begin{array}{cccc}\sum_{i=1}^{n}1&\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}&\ldots&\sum_{i =1}^{n}x_{ik}\\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}&\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}x_{i1}&\ldots&\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}x_ {ik}\\ \vdots&&\\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}&\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}x_{i1}&\ldots&\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}x_ {ik}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}b_{0}\\ b_{1}\\ \vdots\\ b_{k}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i1}y_{i}\\ \vdots\\ \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{ik}y_{i}\end{array}\right]\]The matrix on the left is just \(\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}\) and the matrix on the right is \(\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{y}\), where \(\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\) indicates \(\mathbf{X}\)-transpose, so the normal equations become \(\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{y}\). We will assume throughout this section that \(\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}\) has an inverse, so the vector of estimated coefficients is \(\hat{\mathbf{\rho}}=\mathbf{b}=\left[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}\right]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime} \mathbf{y}\).

Based on six cars, we try to predict horsepower (hp) using engine size (liters) and fuel type. Here is the data set:

\[\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2.0&0\\ 1&2.0&1\\ 1&2.5&0\\ 1&2.5&1\\ 1&3.0&0\\ 1&3.0&1\end{bmatrix}\quad\mathbf{y}=\begin{bmatrix}132\\ 167\\ 170\\ 204\\ 230\\ 260\end{bmatrix}\quad\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}=\begin{bmatrix}6&15&3\\ 15&38.5&7.5\\ 3&7.5&3\end{bmatrix}\quad\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{y}=\begin{bmatrix}1163\\ 3003\\ 631\end{bmatrix}\]

Therefore,

\[\hat{\mathbf{\rho}}=\left[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}\right]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{y}= \begin{bmatrix}79/12&-5/2&-1/3\\ -5/2&1&0\\ -1/3&0&2/3\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1163\\ 3003\\ 631\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}-61.417\\ 95.5\\ 33\end{bmatrix}\]

The coefficient 95.5 for engine size means that, if the fuel type is held constant, then we estimate that horsepower will increase on average by 95.5 when the engine size increases by one liter. Similarly, the coefficient 33 for fuel means that, if the engine size is held constant, then we estimate that horsepower will increase on average by 33 when the fuel type increases by 1. However, increasing fuel type by 1 unit means switching from regular fuel to premium fuel, so the difference in horsepower corresponding to the difference in fuels is 33. Notice that this is the difference between the average for the three premium-fuel cars and the average for the three regular-fuel cars. \(\blacksquare\)

### Residuals, ANOVA, \(\mathbf{F}\), and \(\mathbf{R}\)-Squared

The estimated regression coefficients can be used to obtain the predicted values. Recall that \(\hat{y}_{i}=\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i1}+\hat{\beta}_{2}x_{i2}+\cdots +\hat{\beta}_{k}x_{ik}\). The expression for \(\hat{y}_{i}\) is the product of the \(i\)th row of \(\mathbf{X}\) and the \(\hat{\mathbf{\rho}}\) vector. The vector of predicted values is then \[\begin{bmatrix}\hat{y}_{1}\\ \vdots\\ \hat{y}_{n}\end{bmatrix}=\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=\boldsymbol{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta }}=\boldsymbol{X}[\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{X}]^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^{ \prime}\boldsymbol{y}\] Because \(\boldsymbol{y}\)**-hat** is the product of \(\boldsymbol{H}=\boldsymbol{X}[\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{X}]^{-1} \boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}\) and \(\boldsymbol{y}\), the matrix \(\boldsymbol{H}\) is called the **hat matrix**. A residual is \(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\), so the vector of \(n\) residuals is \[\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{H}\boldsymbol{y }=(\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{H})\boldsymbol{y}.\] The error sum of squares SSE is the sum of the \(n\) squared residuals, \[\text{SSE}=(\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}})^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{ \boldsymbol{y}})=\left\|\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}\right\|^{2}\] An unbiased estimator of \(\sigma^{2}\) is \(\text{MSE}=\text{S}^{2}=\text{SSE}/[n-(k+1)]\). Notice that the estimated variance is the average [with \(n-(k+1)\) in place of \(n\)] squared residual. The divisor \(n-(k+1)\) is used because SSE is proportional to a chi-square rv with \(n-(k+1)\) degrees of freedom under the assumptions given at the beginning of this section, including the assumption that \(\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{X}\) be invertible.

We can rewrite the normal equations in the form

\[\boldsymbol{\theta}=\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X}^{ \prime}\boldsymbol{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime}( \boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})=\boldsymbol{X}^{\prime} (\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}). \tag{12.19}\]

Because the transpose of \(\boldsymbol{X}\) times the residual vector is zero, each of the columns of \(\boldsymbol{X}\), including the column of 1's, is perpendicular to the residual vector \(\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}\). In particular, because the dot product of the column of 1's with the residual vector is zero, the sum of the residuals is zero. There are \(k+1\) columns of \(\boldsymbol{X}\), and the dot product of each column with the residual vector is zero, so there are \(k+1\) conditions satisfied by the residual vector. This helps to explain intuitively why there are only \(n-(k+1)\) degrees of freedom for SSE.

Letting \(\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\) be the vector with \(n\) identical components \(\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\), the total sum of squares SST is the sum of the squared deviations from \(\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\), \(\text{SST}=\left\|\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\right\|^{2}\). Similarly, the regression sum of squares SSR is defined to be the sum of the squared deviations of the predicted values from \(\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\), \(\text{SSR}=\left\|\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}-\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\right\|^{2}\). As before the ANOVA relationship is

\[\text{SST}=\text{SSE}+\text{SSR} \tag{12.20}\]

This can be obtained by subtracting and adding \(\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}\):

\[\text{SST} =\left\|\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\right\|^{2}=\left[ (\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{\hat{y}})+(\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}-\boldsymbol{\bar{ y}})\right]^{\prime}[(\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{\hat{y}})+(\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}- \boldsymbol{\bar{y}})]\] \[=\left\|\boldsymbol{y}-\boldsymbol{\hat{y}}\right\|^{2}+\left\| \boldsymbol{\hat{y}}-\boldsymbol{\bar{y}}\right\|^{2}=\text{SSE}+\text{SSR}.\]

The cross-terms in the matrix product are zero because of Equation (12.19) (see Exercise 102).

Recall that the null hypothesis in the model utility test is \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=\cdots=\beta_{k}=0\), in which case the model consists of just \(\beta_{0}\). That is, under \(H_{0}\) the observations all have the same mean \(\mu=\beta_{0}\). For a normal random sample with mean \(\mu\) and standard deviation \(\sigma\), a proposition in Section 6.4 shows that SST/\(\sigma^{2}\) has the chi-squared distribution with \(n-1\) df. Dividing Equation (12.20) by \(\sigma^{2}\) gives

\[\frac{\text{SST}}{\sigma^{2}}=\frac{\text{SSE}}{\sigma^{2}}+\frac{\text{SSR}}{ \sigma^{2}}\]

It can be shown that SSE and SSR are independent of each other. We know that \(\text{SST}/\sigma^{2}\sim\chi_{n-1}^{2}\) under the null hypothesis and \(\text{SSE}/\sigma^{2}\sim\chi_{n-k-1}^{2}\). Then, by a proposition in Section 6.4, SSR/\(\sigma^{2}\) is distributed as chi-squared with degrees of freedom \([n-1]-[n-(k+1)]=k\). Recall from Section 6.4 that the \(F\) distribution is the ratio of two independent chi-squares that have been divided by their degrees of freedom. Applying this to SSR/\(\sigma^{2}\) and SSE/\(\sigma^{2}\) leads to the \(F\) ratio

\[\frac{\frac{\text{SSR}}{\sigma^{2}k}}{\frac{\text{SSE}}{\sigma^{2}[n-(k+1)]}} =\frac{\frac{\text{SSR}}{k}}{\frac{\text{SSE}}{n-(k+1)}}=\frac{\text{MSR}}{ \text{MSE}}\sim F_{k,n-(k+1)} \tag{12.21}\]

Here \(\text{MSR}=\text{SSR}/k\) and MSE was previously defined as SSE/[\(n-(k+1)\)]. The \(F\) ratio MSR/MSE is a standard part of regression output for statistical computer packages. It tests the null hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=\dots=\beta_{k}=0\), the hypothesis of a constant mean model. This is the model utility test, and it tests the hypothesis that the explanatory variables are useless for predicting \(y\). Rejection of \(H_{0}\) occurs for large values of the \(F\) ratio. This should be intuitively reasonable, because if the prediction quality is good, then SSE should be small and SSR should be large, and therefore the \(F\) ratio should be large. The dividing line between large and small is set using the upper tail of the \(F\) distribution. In particular, \(H_{0}\) is typically rejected if the \(F\) ratio exceeds \(F_{.05,k,n-(k+1)}\).

Another measure of the relationship between \(y\) and the predictors is the \(R^{2}\) statistic, the coefficient of multiple determination, which is the fraction SSR/SST:

\[R^{2}=\frac{\text{SSR}}{\text{SST}}=\frac{\text{SST}-\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}} =1-\frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}} \tag{12.22}\]

By the analysis of variance, Equation (12.20), this is always between 0 and 1. The \(R^{2}\) statistic is also called the squared multiple correlation. For example, suppose \(\text{SST}=200\), \(\text{SSR}=120\), and therefore \(\text{SSE}=80\). Then \(R^{2}=1-(\text{SSE}/\text{SST})=1-80/200=.60\), so the error sum of squares is 60% less than the total sum of squares. This is sometimes interpreted by saying that the regression explains 60% of the variability of \(y\), which means that the regression has reduced the error sum of squares by 60% from what it would be (SST) with just a constant model and no predictors.

The \(F\) ratio and \(R^{2}\) are equivalent statistics in the sense that one can be obtained from the other. For example, dividing numerator and denominator through by SST in Equation (12.21) and using Equation (12.22), we find that the \(F\) ratio is [see Equation (12.18)]

\[F=\frac{R^{2}/k}{(1-R^{2})/[n-(k+1)]}\]In the special case of just one predictor, \(k=1\), \(F=(n-2)R^{2}/(1-R^{2})\), and the multiple correlation is just the absolute value of the ordinary correlation coefficient. This \(F\) is the square of the statistic \(T=\sqrt{n-2}\,R/\sqrt{1-R^{2}}\) given in Section 12.5.

The predicted values and residuals are easily obtained:

\[\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=\boldsymbol{X}\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}=\begin{bmatrix}1&2&0 \\ 1&2&1\\ 1&2.5&0\\ 1&2.5&1\\ 1&3&0\\ 1&3&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}-61.417\\ 95.50\\ 33\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}129.583\\ 162.583\\ 177.333\\ 210.333\\ 225.083\end{bmatrix}\]

\[\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=\begin{bmatrix}132\\ 167\\ 170\\ 204\\ 230\\ 260\end{bmatrix}-\begin{bmatrix}129.583\\ 162.583\\ 177.333\\ 210.333\\ 225.083\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}2.417\\ 4.417\\ -7.333\\ -6.333\\ 4.917\\ 1.917\end{bmatrix}\]

Therefore, the error sum of squares is \(SSE=\|\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}\|^{2}=2.417^{2}+\cdots+1.917^{2}=147.083\) and \(\text{MSE}=s^{2}=\text{SSE}/[n-(k+1)]=147.083/[6-(2+1)]=49.028\). The square root of this yields the estimated standard deviation \(s=7.002\), which is a form of average for the magnitude of the residuals. However, notice that only one of the six residuals exceeds \(s\) in magnitude. The total sum of squares is \(\text{SST}=||\boldsymbol{y}-\overline{\boldsymbol{y}}||^{2}=\sum\left(y_{i}-1 93.83\right)^{2}=10\),900.83. The regression sum of squares can be obtained by subtraction using the analysis of variance, \(\text{SSR}=\text{SST}-\text{SSE}=10\),900.83 \(-147.083=10\),753.75. The sums of squares and the computation of the \(F\) test and \(R^{2}\) are often done through an analysis of variance table, as copied in Figure 12.36 from SAS output.

The regression sum of squares is called the model sum of squares here. The mean square is the sum of squares divided by the degrees of freedom, and the \(F\) value is the ratio of mean squares. Because the \(P\)-value is less than.05, we reject the null hypothesis (that both the _engine size_ and _fuel_ population coefficients are 0) at the.05 level. The coefficient of multiple determination is \(R^{2}=\text{SSR}/\text{SST}=10\),753.75/ 10,900.83 \(=.9865\). We say that the two predictors account for 98.65% of the variance of horsepower because the error sum of squares is reduced by 98.65% compared to the total sum of squares.

## Covariance Matrices

In order to develop hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for the regression coefficients, the standard deviations of the estimated coefficients are needed. These can be obtained from a certain _covariance matrix_, a matrix with the variances on the diagonal and the covariances in the off-diagonal elements. If \(\mathbf{U}\) is a column vector of random variables \(U_{1},\ldots\), \(U_{n}\) with means \(\mu_{1}=E(U_{1}),\ldots,\mu_{n}=E(U_{n})\), let \(\mathbf{\mu}\) be the vector of these \(n\) means and define

\[\text{Cov}(\mathbf{U}) = \begin{bmatrix}\text{Cov}(U_{1},U_{1})&\cdots&\text{Cov}(U_{1},U_ {n})\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \text{Cov}(U_{n},U_{1})&\cdots&\text{Cov}(U_{n},U_{n})\end{bmatrix}\] \[= \begin{bmatrix}E[(U_{1}-\mu_{1})(U_{1}-\mu_{1})]&\cdots&E[(U_{1}- \mu_{1})(U_{n}-\mu_{n})]\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ E[(U_{n}-\mu_{n})(U_{1}-\mu_{1})]&\cdots&E[(U_{n}-\mu_{n})(U_{n}-\mu_{n})]\end{bmatrix}\] \[= E\left\{\begin{bmatrix}U_{1}-\mu_{1}\\ \vdots\\ U_{n}-\mu_{n}\end{bmatrix}[U_{1}-\mu_{1},\ \cdots\,U_{n}-\mu_{n}]\right\} = E\{[\mathbf{U}-\mathbf{\mu}][\mathbf{U}-\mathbf{\mu}]^{\prime}\}\]

When \(n=1\) this reduces to just the ordinary variance. The key to finding the needed covariance matrix is this proposition:

\[\text{PROPOSITION}\]

If \(A\) is a matrix with constant entries and \(\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{U}\), then \(\text{Cov}(\mathbf{V})=\mathbf{A}\text{Cov}(\mathbf{U})\mathbf{A}^{\prime}\).

ProofBy the linearity of the expectation operator, \(E(\mathbf{V})=E(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{U})=\mathbf{A}E(\mathbf{U})\). Then

\[\text{Cov}(\mathbf{V}) = E\big{\{}[\mathbf{A}\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{U})][\mathbf{A}\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{ U})]^{\prime}\big{\}}=E\{\mathbf{A}[\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{U})](\mathbf{A}[\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{U})])^{ \prime}\}\] \[= E\big{\{}\mathbf{A}[\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{U})][\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{U})]^{\prime}\mathbf{ A}^{\prime}\big{\}}\] \[= AE\big{\{}[\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{U})][\mathbf{U}-E(\mathbf{U})]^{\prime}\big{\}} \mathbf{A}^{\prime}=\mathbf{A}\text{Cov}(\mathbf{U})\mathbf{A}^{\prime}\]

Let's apply the proposition to find the covariance matrix of \(\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}\). Because \(\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}=[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{Y}\), we use \(\mathbf{A}=[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\) and \(\mathbf{U}=\mathbf{Y}\). The transpose of \(\mathbf{A}\) is \(\mathbf{A}^{\prime}=\{[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\}^{\prime}=\mathbf{ X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\). The covariance matrix of \(\mathbf{Y}\) is just the variance \(\sigma^{2}\) times the \(n\)-dimensional identity matrix, that is, \(\sigma^{2}\mathbf{I}\), because the observations are independent and all have the same variance \(\sigma^{2}\). Then the proposition says

\[\text{Cov}(\hat{\mathbf{\beta}})=\mathbf{A}\text{Cov}(\mathbf{Y})\mathbf{A}^{\prime}=[\mathbf{X}^{ \prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}[\sigma^{2}\mathbf{I}]\mathbf{X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{ X}]^{-1}=\sigma^{2}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1} \tag{12.24}\]We also need to find the expected value of \(\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}\),

\[E(\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}) =E([\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{Y})=[\mathbf{X}^{ \prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}E(\mathbf{Y})\] \[=[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}E(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}+\bm {\varepsilon})=[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\beta}=\bm {\beta}\]

That is, \(\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\mathbf{\beta}\) (for each \(i\), \(\hat{\beta}_{i}\) is unbiased for estimating \(\beta_{i}\)).

Write the inverse matrix as \([\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}=\mathbf{C}=[c_{ij}]\). In particular, let \(c_{00},c_{11},\ldots,c_{kk}\) be the diagonal elements of this inverse matrix. Then \(V(\hat{\beta}_{j})=\sigma^{2}c_{ij}\). Also, \(\hat{\beta}_{j}\) is a linear combination of \(Y_{1}\),..., \(Y_{n}\), which are independent normal, so \((\hat{\beta}_{j}-\beta_{j})/(\sigma\sqrt{c_{ij}})\sim N(0,1)\) It follows that (this requires the independence of \(S\) and the estimated regression coefficients, which we will not prove) \((\hat{\beta}_{j}-\beta_{j})/(S\sqrt{c_{ij}})\sim t_{n-(k+1)}\). This leads to the confidence interval and hypothesis test for coefficients of Section 12.7.

The 95% confidence interval for \(\beta_{j}\) is

\[\hat{\beta}_{j}\pm t_{.025,n-(k+1)}s\sqrt{c_{ji}}. \tag{12.25}\]

We can test the hypothesis \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{j}=\beta_{j0}\) using the \(t\) ratio

\[T=\quad\frac{\hat{\beta}_{j}-\beta_{j0}}{S\sqrt{c_{ij}}}\sim t_{n-(k+1)}\]

Statistical software packages usually provide output for testing \(H_{0}\)\(\beta_{j}=0\) against the two-sided alternative \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\beta_{j}\neq 0\). In particular, we would reject \(H_{0}\) in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\) at the 5% level if \(\mathfrak{l}\mathfrak{l}\) exceeds \(t_{.025,n-(k+1)}\). Usually, with computer output there is no need to use statistical tables for hypothesis tests because \(P\)-values for these tests are included.

For the engine horsepower scenario we found that \(s=7.002\), \(\hat{\beta}_{0}=-61.417\), \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=95.5\), \(\hat{\beta}_{2}=33\) and \([\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\) has elements \(c_{00}=79/12\), \(c_{11}=1\), \(c_{22}=2/3\). Therefore, we get these 95% confidence intervals:

\[\hat{\beta}_{1}\pm t_{.025,6-(2+1)}s\sqrt{c_{11}}=95.5\pm 3.182(7.002) \sqrt{1}=95.50\pm 22.28=[73.22,117.78]\] \[\hat{\beta}_{2}\pm t_{.025,6-(2+1)}s\sqrt{c_{22}}=33\pm 3.182(7.002) \sqrt{2/3}=33\pm 18.19=[14.81,51.19]\]

We can also do the individual \(t\) tests for the coefficients:

\[\frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}-0}{s\sqrt{c_{11}}}=\frac{95.5-0}{7.002\sqrt {1}}=13.64,\qquad\text{two-tailed $P$-value}=.0009\] \[\frac{\hat{\beta}_{2}-0}{s\sqrt{c_{22}}}=\frac{33-0}{7.002\sqrt{2 /3}}=5.77,\quad\text{two-tailed $P$-value}=.0103\]

Both of these exceed \(t_{.025,6-2-1}=3.182\) in absolute value (and their \(P\)-values are less than.05), so for both of them we reject at the 5% level the null hypothesis that the coefficient is \(0\), in favor of the two-sided alternative. These conclusions are consistent with the fact that the corresponding confidence intervals do not include zero. Also, recall that the \(F\) test rejected at the 5% level the null hypothesis that both coefficients are zero. As our intuition suggests, horsepower increases with engine size and horsepower is higher when the engine requires premium fuel.

## The Hat Matrix

The foregoing proposition can be used to find estimated standard deviations for predicted values and residuals. Recall that the vector of predicted values can be obtained by multiplying the hat matrix \(\mathbf{H}\) times the \(\mathbf{Y}\) vector, \(\mathbf{HY}=\hat{\mathbf{Y}}\). First, in order to apply the proposition, let's obtain the transpose of \(\mathbf{H}\). With the help of the rules \((\mathbf{AB})^{\prime}=\mathbf{B}^{\prime}\mathbf{A}^{\prime}\) and \((\mathbf{A}^{-1})^{\prime}=(\mathbf{A}^{\prime})^{-1}\), we find that \(\mathbf{H}\) is symmetric, \(\mathbf{H}^{\prime}=\mathbf{H}\):

\[\mathbf{H}^{\prime}=\Big{\{}\mathbf{X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\Big{\}} ^{\prime}=(\mathbf{X}^{\prime})^{\prime}\{[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\}^{\prime} \mathbf{X}^{\prime}=\mathbf{X}\big{\{}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{\prime}\,\}^{-1}\mathbf{X}^ {\prime}=\mathbf{X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}=\mathbf{H}.\]

Therefore,

\[\begin{split}\text{Cov}(\hat{\mathbf{Y}})&=\mathbf{H}\text{ Cov}(\mathbf{Y})\mathbf{H}^{\prime}=\mathbf{X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}[ \sigma^{2}I]\mathbf{X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\\ &=\sigma^{2}\mathbf{X}[\mathbf{X}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}]^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}= \sigma^{2}\mathbf{H}.\end{split} \tag{26}\]

A similar calculation shows that the covariance matrix of the residuals is

\[\text{Cov}(\mathbf{Y}-\hat{\mathbf{Y}})=\sigma^{2}(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{H}) \tag{27}\]

Of course, the true variance \(\sigma^{2}\) is generally unknown, so the estimate \(s^{2}=\text{MSE}\) is used instead.

Continue again with the horsepower example. If residuals and predicted values are requested from SAS, then the output includes the information in Figure 37.

The column labeled "Std Error Mean Predict" has the estimated standard deviations for the predicted values and it contains the square roots of the \(s^{2}\mathbf{H}\) matrix diagonal elements. The column labeled "Std Error Residual" has the estimated standard deviations for the residuals, and it contains the square roots of the diagonal elements of \(s^{2}(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{H})\). The column labeled "Student Residual" is what we defined as the standardized residual in Section 12.6. It is the ratio of the previous two columns. \(\blacksquare\)

The hat matrix is also important as a measure of the influence of individual observations. Because \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}=\mathbf{H}\mathbf{y}\), \(\hat{y}_{i}=h_{i1}y_{1}+h_{i2}y_{2}+\cdots+h_{in}y_{n}\), and therefore \(\partial\hat{y}_{i}/\partial y_{i}=h_{ii}\). That is, the partial derivative of \(\hat{y}_{i}\) with respect to \(y_{i}\) is the \(i\)th diagonal element of the hat matrix. In other words, the \(i\)th diagonal element of \(\mathbf{H}\) measures the influence of the \(i\)th observation on its predicted value. The diagonal

Figure 37: Predicted values and residuals from SASelements of \(\boldsymbol{H}\) are sometimes called the **leverages** to indicate their influence over the regression. An observation with very high leverage will tend to pull the regression toward it, and its residual will tend to be small. Of course, \(\boldsymbol{H}\) depends only on the values of the predictors, so the leverage measures only one aspect of influence. If the influence of an observation is defined in terms of the effect on the predicted values when the observation is omitted, then an influential observation is one that has both large leverage and a large (in absolute value) residual.

Students in a statistics class measured their height, foot length, and wingspan (measured fingertip to fingertip with hands outstretched) in inches. Leonardo da Vinci was aware that the wingspan tends to be very nearly the same as height. Here in Table 12.3 are the measurements for 16 students. The last column has the leverages for the regression of wingspan on height and foot length.

In Figure 12.38 we show the plot of height against foot length, along with the leverage for each point. Notice that the points at the extreme right and left of the plot have high leverage, and the points near the center have low leverage. However, it is interesting that the point with highest leverage is not at the extremes of height or foot length. This is student number 7, with a 10-in. foot and height of 71 in., and the high leverage comes from the height being extreme relative to foot length. Indeed, when there are several predictors, high leverage often occurs when values of one predictor are extreme relative to the values of other predictors. For example, if height and weight are predictors, then an overweight or underweight subject would likely have high leverage.

\end{table}
Table 12.3: Height, foot length, and wingspanIn Figure 2.39 there is some useful output from MINITAB, including the model utility test, the regression coefficients, and the correlations among the variables. The correlation table shows all three correlations among the three variables along with their \(P\)-values. Clearly, the three variables are very strongly related. However, when wingspan is regressed on height and foot length, the \(P\)-value for foot length is greater than.05, so we can consider eliminating foot length from the regression equation. Does it make sense for foot length to be very strongly related to wingspan, as measured by correlation, but for the foot length term to be not statistically significant in the regression equation? The difference is that the regression test is asking whether foot length is needed in addition to height. Because the two predictors are themselves highly correlated, foot length is redundant in the sense that it offers little prediction ability beyond what is contributed by height.

These are the prices in thousands for three houses in Brookwood and then three houses in Pleasant Hills. Apply parts (a), (b), and (c) to this data set.
96. The constant term is not always needed in the regression equation. For example, many physical principles involve proportions, where no constant term is needed. In general, if the dependent variable should be 0 when the independent variables are 0, then the constant term is not needed. Then it is preferable to omit \(\beta_{0}\) and use the model \(Y=\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+\beta_{k}x_{k}+\varepsilon\). Here we focus on the special case \(k=1\). 1. Differentiate the appropriate sum of squares to derive the one normal equation for estimating \(\beta_{1}\). 2. Express your normal equation in matrix terms, \(\boldsymbol{X^{\prime}X\beta}=\boldsymbol{X^{\prime}y}\), where \(\boldsymbol{X}\) consists of one column with the values of the predictor variable. 3. Apply part (b) to the data of Example 12.32, using hp for \(\boldsymbol{y}\) and just engine size in \(\boldsymbol{X}\). 4. Explain why deletion of the constant term might be appropriate for the data set in part (c). 5. By fitting a regression model with a constant term added to the model of part (c), test the hypothesis that the constant is not needed.
97. Assuming that the analysis of variance table is available, show how the last three columns of Figure 12.37 (the columns related to residuals) can be obtained from the previous columns.
98. Given that the residuals are \(\boldsymbol{y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=(\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{H})\boldsymbol {y}\), show that \(\text{Cov}(\boldsymbol{Y}-\hat{\boldsymbol{Y}})=(\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{H}) \sigma^{2}\).
99. Use Equations (12.26) and (12.27) to show that each of the leverages is between 0 and 1, and therefore the variances of the predicted values and residuals are between 0 and \(\sigma^{2}\).
100. Consider the special case \(y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x+\varepsilon\), so \(k=1\) and \(\boldsymbol{X}\) consists of a column of 1's and a column of the values \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\) of \(x\). 1. Write the normal equations in matrix form, and solve by inverting \(\boldsymbol{X^{\prime}X}\). [_Hint_: if \(ad\neq bc\), then \[\begin{bmatrix}a&b\\ c&d\end{bmatrix}^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{bmatrix}d&-b\\ -c&a\end{bmatrix}\] Check your answers against those in Section 12.2.] 2. Use the inverse of \(\boldsymbol{X^{\prime}X}\) to obtain expressions for the variances of the coefficients, and check your answers against the results given in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 (\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) is the predicted value corresponding to \(x*=0\)). 3. Compare the predictions from this model with the predictions from the model of Exercise 94. Comparing other aspects of the two models, discuss similarities and differences. Mention, in particular, the hat matrix, the predicted values, and the residuals.
101. Continue Exercise 94. 1. Find the elements of the hat matrix and use them to obtain the variance of the predicted values. Noting the result of Exercise 100(c), compare your result with the expression for \(V(\hat{Y})\) given in Section 12.4. 2. Using the diagonal elements of \(\boldsymbol{H}\), obtain the variances of the residuals and compare with the expression given in Section 12.6 3. Compare the variances of predicted values for an \(x\) that is close to \(\overline{x}\) and an \(x\) that is far from \(\overline{x}\). 4. Compare the variances of residuals for an \(x\) that is close to \(\overline{x}\) and an \(x\) that is far from \(\overline{x}\). 5. Give intuitive explanations for the results of parts (c) and (d).
102. Carry out the details of the derivation for the analysis of variance, Equation (12.20).
103. The measurements here are similar to those in Example 12.36, except that here the students did the measurements at home, and the results suffered in accuracy. These are measurements from a sample of ten students: 
 1. Regress wingspan on the other two variables. Carry out the test of model utility and the tests for the two individual regression coefficients of the predictors.

* Obtain the diagonal elements of the hat matrix (leverages). Identify the point with the highest leverage. What is unusual about the point? Given the instructor's assertion that there were no students in the class less than five feet tall, would you say that there was an error? Give another reason that this student's measurements seem wrong.
* For the other points with high leverages, what distinguishes them from the points with ordinary leverage values?
* Examining the residuals, find another student whose data might be wrong.
* Discuss the elimination of questionable points in order to obtain valid regression results.

Resulting summary quantities included \(n=11\), \(\Sigma(\text{speed})=205.4\), \(\Sigma(\text{speed})^{2}=3880.08\), \(\Sigma(\text{rate})=35.16\), \(\Sigma(\text{rate})^{2}=112.681\), and \(\Sigma(\text{speed})(\text{rate})=660.130\).

* In Section 12.4, we presented a formula for the variance \(V(\hat{b}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x^{*})\) and a CI for \(\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x^{*}\). Taking \(x^{*}=0\) gives \(\sigma^{2}_{\hat{\beta}_{0}}\) and a CI for \(\beta_{0}\). Use the data of Example 12.12 to calculate the estimated standard deviation of \(\hat{\beta}_{0}\) and a 95% CI for the \(y\)-intercept of the true regression line.
* Show that \(\text{SSE}=S_{yy}-\hat{\beta}_{1}S_{xy}\), which gives an alternative computational formula for SSE.
* Suppose that \(x\) and \(y\) are positive variables and that a sample of \(n\) pairs results in \(r\approx 1\). If the sample correlation coefficient is computed for the (\(x\), \(y^{2}\)) pairs, will the resulting value also be approximately 1? Explain.
* Let \(s_{x}\) and \(s_{y}\) denote the sample standard deviations of the observed \(x\)'s and \(y\)'s, respectively [so \(s_{x}^{2}=\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}/(n-1)}\) and similarly for \(s_{y}^{2}\)].
* Show that an alternative expression for the estimated regression line \(\hat{\beta}_{0}+\hat{\beta}_{1}x\) is \[y=\overline{y}+r\cdot\frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}(x-\overline{x})\]
* This expression for the regression line can be interpreted as follows. Suppose \(r=.5\). What then is the predicted \(y\) for an \(x\) that lies 1 SD (\(s_{x}\) units) above the mean of the \(x_{i}\)'s? If \(r\) were 1, the prediction would be for \(y\) to lie 1 SD above its mean \(\overline{y}\), but since \(r=.5\), we predict a \(y\) that is only.5 SD (.5\(s_{y}\) unit) above \(\overline{y}\). Using the data in Exercise 62 for a patient whose age is 1 SD below the average age in the sample, by how many standard deviations is the patient's predicted \(\Delta\text{CBG}\) above or below the average \(\Delta\text{CBG}\) for the sample?

The accompanying data on \(x=\text{inlet}\) temperature (\({}^{\circ}\mathbb{C}\)) and \(y=\text{removal}\) efficiency (%) was the basis for a scatter plot that appeared in the article "Treatment of Mixed Hydrogen Sulfide and Organic Vapors in a Rock Medium Biofilter"(_Water Environ.

* Does a scatter plot of the data suggest appropriateness of the simple linear regression model?
* Fit the simple linear regression model, obtain a point prediction of removal efficiency when temperature = 10.50, and calculate the value of the corresponding residual.
* Roughly what is the size of a typical deviation of points in the scatter plot from the least squares line?
* What proportion of observed variation in removal efficiency can be attributed to the model relationship?
* Estimate the slope coefficient in a way that conveys information about reliability and precision, and interpret your estimate.
* Personal communication with the authors of the article revealed that one additional observation was not included in their scatter plot: (6.53, 96.55). What impact does this additional observation have on the equation of the least squares line and the values of \(s\) and \(r\)2?
* Normal hatchery processes in aquaculture inevitably produce stress in fish, which may negatively impact growth, reproduction, flesh quality, and susceptibility to disease. Such stress manifests itself in elevated and sustained corticosteroid levels. The article "Evaluation of Simple Instruments for the Measurement of Blood Glucose and Lactate, and Plasma Protein as Stress Indicators in Fish"(_J. World Aquacult. Soc._, 1999: 276-284) described an experiment in which fish were subjected to a stress protocol and then removed and tested at various times after the protocol had been applied. The accompanying data on \(x\) = time (min) and \(y\) = blood glucose level (mmol/L) was read from a plot. Use the methods developed in this chapter to analyze the data, and write a brief report summarizing your conclusions (assume that the investigators are particularly interested in glucose level 30 min after stress).
* The article "Evaluating the BOD POD for Assessing Body Fat in Collegiate Football Players" (_Med. Sci. Sports Exercise_, 1999: 1350-1356) reports on a new air displacement device for measuring body fat. The customary procedure utilizes the hydrostatic weighing device, which measures the percentage of body fat by means of water displacement. Here is representative data read from a graph in the paper.
* Use the data to develop a way of predicting an HW measurement from a BOD POD measurement, and investigate the effectiveness of such predictions.
* 4)}\). Let \(\text{SS}_{x1}\) and \(\text{SS}_{x2}\) denote \(\sum{(x_{i}
- \overline{x})}^{2}\) for the data on the first and second abrasives, respectively. A test of \(H\)0: \(\beta_{1}
- \gamma_{1} = 0\) (equal slopes) is based on the statistic \[T = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{1}
- \hat{\gamma}_{1}}{\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{\frac{1}{\text{ss}_{x1}} + \frac{1}{\text{ss}_{x2}}}}\] When \(H\)0 is true, \(T\) has a \(t\) distribution with \(n\)1 + \(n\)2
- 4 df. Suppose the 15 observations using the alternative abrasive give \(\text{SS}_{x2} = 7152.5578\), \(\hat{\gamma}_{1} =.006845\), and \(\text{SSE}_{2}\) =.51350. Using this along with the data of Exercise 105, carry out a test at level.05 to see whether expected change in wear loss associated with a 1% increase in austenite content is identical for the two types of abrasive.
115. Show that the ANOVA version of the model utility test discussed in Section 12.3 (with test statistic \(F=\text{MSR/MSE}\)) is in fact a likelihood ratio test for \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) versus \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\). [_Hint_: We have already pointed out that the least squares estimates of \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) are the mle's. What is the mle of \(\beta_{0}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true? Now determine the mle of \(\sigma^{2}\) both in \(\Omega\) (when \(\beta_{1}\) is not necessarily 0) and in \(\Omega_{0}\) (when \(H_{0}\) is true).]
116. Show that the \(t\) ratio version of the model utility test is equivalent to the ANOVA \(F\) statistic version of the test. Equivalent here means that rejecting \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) when either \(t\geq t_{\alpha/2,n-2}\) or \(t\leq-t_{\alpha/2,\ n-2}\) is the same as rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(f\geq F_{\alpha,1,n-2}\).
117. When a scatter plot of bivariate data shows a pattern resembling an exponentially increasing or decreasing curve, the following _multiplicative_ exponential model is often used: \(Y=\alpha e^{\beta x}\cdot\varepsilon\). **a.**: What does this multiplicative model imply about the relationship between \(Y^{\prime}=\ln(Y)\) and \(x?\) [_Hint_: take logs on both sides of the model equation and let \(\beta_{0}=\ln(\alpha)\), \(\beta_{1}=\beta\), \(\varepsilon^{\prime}=\ln\) (\(\varepsilon\)), and suppose that \(\varepsilon\) has a lognormal distribution.] **b.**: The accompanying data resulted from an investigation of how ethylene content of lettuce seeds (\(y\), in nL/g dry wt) varied with exposure time (\(x\), in min) to an ethylene absorbent ("Ethylene Synthesis in Lettuce Seeds: Its Physiological Significance," _Plant Physiol._, 1972: 719-722). 

Fit the simple linear regression model to this data, and check model adequacy using the residuals. **c.**: Is a scatter plot of the data consistent with the exponential regression model? Fit this model by first carrying out a simple linear regression analysis using \(\ln(y)\) as the dependent variable and \(x\) as the independent variable. How good a fit is the simple linear regression model to the "transformed" data [the (\(x\), \(\ln(y)\)) pairs]? What are point estimates of the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta?\) **d.**: Obtain a 95% prediction interval for ethylene content when exposure time is 50 min. [_Hint_: first obtain a PI for \(\ln(y)\) based on the simple linear regression carried out in (c).]
118. No tortilla chip afficionado likes soggy chips, so it is important to identify characteristics of the production process that produce chips with an appealing texture. The following data on \(x=\) frying time (sec) and \(y=\) moisture content (%) appeared in the article "Thermal and Physical Properties of Tortilla Chips as a Function of Frying Time" (\(J\). _Food Process. Preserv._, 1995: 175-189). 

* Construct a scatter plot of the data and comment. **b.**: Construct a scatter plot of the [\(\ln(x)\), \(\ln(y)\)] pairs (i.e. transform both \(x\) and \(y\) by logs) and comment. **c.**: Consider the _multiplicative_ power model \(Y=\alpha x^{\beta}\varepsilon\). What does this model imply about the relationship between \(y^{\prime}=\ln(y)\) and \(x^{\prime}=\ln(x)\) (assuming that \(\varepsilon\) has a lognormal distribution)? **d.**: Obtain a prediction interval for moisture content when frying time is 25 s. [_Hint_: first carry out a simple linear regression of \(y^{\prime}\) on \(x^{\prime}\) and calculate an appropriate prediction interval.]
119. The article "Determination of Biological Maturity and Effect of Harvesting and Drying Conditions on Milling Quality of Paddy" (\(J\). _Agric. Engr. Res._, 1975: 353-361) reported the following data on date of harvesting (\(x\), the number of days after flowering) and yield of paddy, a grain farmed in India (\(y\), in kg/ha). 

* Construct a scatter plot of the data. What model is suggested by the plot? **b.**: Use a statistical software package to fit the model suggested in (a) and test its utility. **c.**: Use the software package to obtain a prediction interval for yield when the crop is harvested 25 days after flowering, and also a confidence interval for expected yield in situations where the crop is harvested25 days after flowering. How do these two intervals compare to each other? Is this result consistent with what you learned in simple linear regression? Explain. **d.**: Use the software package to obtain a PI and CI when \(x=40\). How do these intervals compare to the corresponding intervals obtained in (c)? Is this result consistent with what you learned in simple linear regression? Explain. **e.**: Carry out a test of hypotheses to decide whether the quadratic predictor in the model fit in (b) provides useful information about yield (presuming that the linear predictor remains in the model).
**120.**: The article "Validation of the Rockport Fitness Walking Test in College Males and Females" (_Res. Q. Exercise Sport_, 1994: 152-158) recommended the following estimated regression equation for relating \(y=\text{VO}_{2}\text{max}\) (L/min, a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness) to the predictors \(x_{1}=\text{gender}\) (female = 0, male = 1), \(x_{2}=\text{weight}\) (lb), \(x_{3}=\text{1-mile walk time (min)}\), and \(x_{4}=\text{heart rate at the end of the walk (beats/min)}\): \[y=3.5959+.6566x_{1}+.0096x_{2}\] \[-.0996x_{3}-.0080x_{4}\] **a.**: How would you interpret the estimated coefficient \(-.0996\)? **b.**: How would you interpret the estimated coefficient.6566? **c.**: Suppose that an observation made on a male whose weight was 170 lb, walk time was 11 min, and heart rate was 140 beats/min resulted in \(\text{VO}_{2}\text{max}=3.15\). What would you have predicted for \(\text{VO}_{2}\text{max}\) in this situation, and what is the value of the corresponding residual? **d.**: Using \(\text{SSE}=30.1033\) and \(\text{SST}=102.3922\), what proportion of observed variation in \(\text{VO}_{2}\text{max}\) can be attributed to the model relationship? **e.**: Assuming a sample size of \(n=20\), carry out a test of hypotheses to decide whether the chosen model specifies a useful relationship between \(\text{VO}_{2}\text{max}\) and at least one of the predictors.
**121.**: A sample of \(n=20\) companies was selected, and the values of \(y=\text{stock price}\) and \(k=15\) predictor variables (such as quarterly dividend, previous year's earnings, and debt ratio) were determined.

## Chapter 1 Introduction

In the simplest type of situation considered in this chapter, each observation in a sample is classified as belonging to one of a finite number of categories (For example, blood type could be one of the four categories O, A, B, or AB). With \(p_{i}\) denoting the probability that any particular observation belongs in category \(i\) (or the proportion of the population belonging to category \(i\)), we wish to test a null hypothesis that completely specifies the values of all the \(p_{i}\)'s (such as \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=.45\), \(p_{2}=.35\), \(p_{3}=.15\), \(p_{4}=.05\), when there are four categories). The test statistic will be a measure of the discrepancy between the observed numbers in the categories and the expected numbers when \(H_{0}\) is true. Because a decision will be reached by comparing the computed value of the test statistic to a critical value of the chi-squared distribution, the procedure is called a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test.

Sometimes the null hypothesis specifies that the \(p_{i}\)'s depend on some smaller number of parameters without specifying the values of these parameters. For example, with three categories the null hypothesis might state that \(p_{1}=\theta^{2}\), \(p_{2}=2\theta(1-\theta)\), and \(p_{3}=(1-\theta)^{2}\). For a chi-squared test to be performed, the values of any unspecified parameters must be estimated from the sample data. These problems are discussed in Section 13.2. The methods are then applied to test a null hypothesis that states that the sample comes from a particular family of distributions, such as the Poisson family (with \(\lambda\) estimated from the sample) or the normal family (with \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) estimated).

Chi-squared tests for two different situations are presented in Section 13.3. In the first, the null hypothesis states that the \(p_{i}\)'s are the same for several different populations. The second type of situation involves taking a sample from a single population and classifying each individual with respect to two different categoricalfactors (such as religious preference and political party registration). The null hypothesis in this situation is that the two factors are independent within the population.

## 3.1 Goodness-of-Fit Tests When Category Probabilities Are Completely Specified

A binomial experiment consists of a sequence of independent trials in which each trial can result in one of two possible outcomes, \(S\) (for success) and \(F\) (for failure). The probability of success, denoted by \(p\), is assumed to be constant from trial to trial, and the number \(n\) of trials is fixed at the outset of the experiment. In Chapter 9, we presented a large-sample \(z\) test for testing \(H_{0}\): \(p=p_{0}\). Notice that this null hypothesis specifies both \(P(S)\) and \(P(F)\), since if \(P(S)=p_{0}\), then \(P(F)=1-p_{0}\). Denoting \(P(F)\) by \(q\) and \(1-p_{0}\) by \(q_{0}\), the null hypothesis can alternatively be written as \(H_{0}\): \(p=p_{0}\), \(q=q_{0}\). The \(z\) test is two-tailed when the alternative of interest is \(p\neq p_{0}\).

A **multinomial experiment** generalizes a binomial experiment by allowing each trial to result in one of \(k\) possible outcomes, where \(k\geq 2\). For example, suppose a store accepts three different types of credit cards. A multinomial experiment would result from observing the type of credit card used--type 1, type 2, or type 3--by each of the next \(n\) customers who pay with a credit card. In general, we will refer to the \(k\) possible outcomes on any given trial as categories, and \(p_{i}\) will denote the probability that a trial results in category \(i\). If the experiment consists of selecting \(n\) individuals or objects from a population and categorizing each one, then \(p_{i}\) is the proportion of the population falling in the \(i\)th category (such an experiment will be approximately multinomial provided that \(n\) is much smaller than the population size).

The null hypothesis of interest will specify the value of each \(p_{i}\). For example, in the case \(k=3\), we might have \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=.5\), \(p_{2}=.3\), \(p_{3}=.2\). The alternative hypothesis will state that \(H_{0}\) is not true--that is, that at least one of the \(p_{i}\)'s has a value different from that asserted by \(H_{0}\) (in which case at least two must be different, since they sum to 1). The symbol \(p_{i0}\) will represent the value of \(p_{i}\) claimed by the null hypothesis. In the example just given, \(p_{10}=.5\), \(p_{20}=.3\), and \(p_{30}=.2\).

Before the multinomial experiment is performed, the number of trials that will result in category \(i\) (\(i=1\), 2, \(\ldots\), or \(k\)) is a random variable--just as the number of successes and the number of failures in a binomial experiment are random variables. This random variable will be denoted by \(N_{i}\) and its observed value by \(n_{i}\). Since each trial results in exactly one of the \(k\) categories, \(\Sigma N_{i}=n\), and the same is true of the \(n_{i}\)'s. As an example, an experiment with \(n=100\) and \(k=3\) might yield \(N_{1}=46\), \(N_{2}=35\), and \(N_{3}=19\).

The expected number of successes and expected number of failures in a binomial experiment are \(np\) and \(nq\), respectively. When \(H_{0}\): \(p=p_{0}\), \(q=q_{0}\) is true, the expected numbers of successes and failures are \(np_{0}\) and \(nq_{0}\), respectively. Similarly, in a multinomial experiment the expected number of trials resulting in category \(i\) is \(E(N_{i})=np_{i}\) (\(i=1\), \(\ldots\), \(k\)). When \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=p_{10}\), \(\ldots\), \(p_{k}=p_{k0}\) is true, these expected values become \(E(N_{1})=np_{10}\), \(E(N_{2})=np_{20}\), \(\ldots\), \(E(N_{k})=np_{k0}\). For the case \(k=3\), \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=.5\), \(p_{2}=.3\), \(p_{3}=.2\), and \(n=100\), we have \(E(N_{1})=100(.5)=50\), \(E(N_{2})=30\), and \(E(N_{3})=20\) when \(H_{0}\) is true. The \(n_{i}\)'sare often displayed in a tabular format consisting of a row of \(k\) cells, one for each category, as illustrated in Table 13.1. The expected values when \(H_{0}\) is true are displayed just below the observed values. The \(N_{i}\)'s and \(n_{i}\)'s are usually referred to as _observed cell counts_ (or _observed cell frequencies_), and \(np_{10}\), \(np_{20}\),..., \(np_{k0}\) are the corresponding _expected cell counts_ under \(H_{0}\).

The \(n_{i}\)'s should all be reasonably close to the corresponding \(np_{i0}\)'s when \(H_{0}\) is true. On the other hand, several of the observed counts should differ substantially from these expected counts when the actual values of the \(p_{i}\)'s differ markedly from what the null hypothesis asserts. The test procedure involves assessing the discrepancy between the \(n_{i}\)'s and the \(np_{i0}\)'s, with \(H_{0}\) being rejected when the discrepancy is sufficiently large. It is natural to base a measure of discrepancy on the squared deviations \((n_{1}-np_{10})^{2}\), \((n_{2}-np_{20})^{2}\),..., \((n_{k}-np_{k0})^{2}\). An obvious way to combine these into an overall measure is to add them together to obtain \(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}(n_{i}-np_{i0})^{2}\). However, suppose \(np_{10}=100\) and \(np_{20}=10\). Then if \(n_{1}=95\) and \(n_{2}=5\), the two categories contribute the same squared deviations to the proposed measure. Yet \(n_{1}\) is only 5% less than what would be expected when \(H_{0}\) is true, whereas \(n_{2}\) is 50% less. To take relative magnitudes of the deviations into account, we will divide each squared deviation by the corresponding expected count and then combine.

Before giving a more detailed description, we must discuss the _chi-squared distribution_. This distribution was introduced in Section 4.4, discussed in Section 6.4, and used in Chapter 8 to obtain a confidence interval for the variance \(\sigma^{2}\) of a normal population. The chi-squared distribution has a single parameter, called the number of degrees of freedom (df) of the distribution, with possible values 1, 2, 3,... Analogous to the critical value \(t_{\alpha,v}\) for the \(t\) distribution, \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,v}\) is the value such that \(\alpha\) of the area under the \(\chi^{2}\) curve with \(v\) df lies to the right of \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,v}\) (see Figure 13.1). Selected values of \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,v}\) are given in Appendix Table A.6.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Category:** & \(i=1\) & \(i=2\) & \(\cdots\) & \(i=k\) & Row Total \\ \cline{2-7} Observed & \(n_{1}\) & \(n_{2}\) &... & \(n_{k}\) & \(n\) \\ \cline{2-7} Expected & \(np_{10}\) & \(np_{20}\) &... & \(np_{k0}\) & \(n\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.1: Observed and expected cell counts

Figure 13.1: A critical value for a chi-squared distribution

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{THEOREM}\end{array}\]

Provided that \(np_{i}\geq 5\) for every \(i\) (\(i=1\), \(2\),..., \(k\)), the variable

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{\left(N_{i}-np_{i}\right)^{2}}{np_{i}}=\sum_{\text{ all cells}}\frac{\left(\text{observed}-\text{expected}\right)^{2}}{\text{expected}}\]

has approximately a chi-squared distribution with \(k-1\) df.

The fact that \(\text{df}=k-1\) is a consequence of the restriction \(\Sigma N_{i}=n\). Although there are \(k\) observed cell counts, once any \(k-1\) are known, the remaining one is uniquely determined. That is, there are only \(k-1\) "freely determined" cell counts, and thus \(k-1\) df.

If \(np_{i0}\) is substituted for \(np_{i}\) in \(\chi^{2}\), the resulting test statistic has approximately a chi-squared distribution when \(H_{0}\) is true. Rejection of \(H_{0}\) is appropriate when \(\chi^{2}\geq c\) (because large discrepancies between observed and expected counts lead to a large value of \(\chi^{2}\)), and the choice \(c=\chi^{2}_{\text{z},k-1}\) yields a test with significance level \(\alpha\).

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{Null hypothesis: }H_{0}\text{: }p_{1}=p_{10}\text{, }p_{2}=p_{20}\text{, }\ldots,p_{k}=p_{\text{k0}}\\ \text{Alternative hypothesis: }H_{\text{a}}\text{: at least one }p_{i}\text{ does not equal }p_{i0}\\ \text{Test statistic value: }\chi^{2}=\sum\limits_{\text{all cells}}\frac{\left(\text{observed}-\text{expected}\right)^{2}}{\text{expected}}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{\left(n_{i}-np_{i0}\right)^{2}}{np_{i0}}\\ \text{Rejection region: }\chi^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{\text{z},\ k-1}\end{array}\]

If we focus on two different characteristics of an organism, each controlled by a single gene, and cross a pure strain having genotype AABB with a pure strain having genotype aabb (capital letters denoting dominant alleles and small letters recessive alleles), the resulting genotype will be AaBb. If these first-generation organisms are then crossed among themselves (a dihybrid cross), there will be four phenotypes depending on whether a dominant allele of either type is present. Mendel's laws of inheritance imply that these four phenotypes should have probabilities 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16 of arising in any given dihybrid cross.

The article "Linkage Studies of the Tomato" (_Trans. Royal Canad. Institut._, 1931: 1-19) reports the following data on phenotypes from a dihybrid cross of tall cut-leaf tomatoes with dwarf potato-leaf tomatoes. There are \(k=4\) categories corresponding to the four possible phenotypes, with the null hypothesis being

\[H_{0}:p_{1}=\frac{9}{16},\ p_{2}=\frac{3}{16},\ p_{3}=\frac{3}{16},\ p_{4}= \frac{1}{16}\]

The expected cell counts are \(9n/16\), \(3n/16\), \(3n/16\), and \(n/16\), and the test is based on \(k-1=3\) df. The total sample size was \(n=1611\). Observed and expected counts are given in Table 13.2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c}  & \(i=1\) & \(i=2\) & \(i=3\) & \(i=4\) \\  & **Tall**, & **Tall**, & **Dwarf**, & **Dwarf**, \\  & **Cut-Leaf** & **Potato-Leaf** & **Cut-Leaf** & **Potato-Leaf** \\ \cline{2-5} \(n_{i}\) & 926 & 288 & 293 & 104 \\ \(np_{i0}\) & 906.2 & 302.1 & 302.1 & 100.7 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.2: Observed and expected cell counts for Example 13.1The contribution to \(\chi^{2}\) from the first cell is

\[\frac{\left(n_{1}-np_{10}\right)^{2}}{np_{10}}=\frac{\left(926-906.2\right)^{2}}{ 906.2}=.433\]

Cells 2, 3, and 4 contribute.658,.274, and.108, respectively, so \(\chi^{2}=.433\) +.658 +.274 +.108 = 1.473. A test with significance level.10 requires \(\chi^{2}_{.10,3}\), the number in the 3 df row and.10 column of Appendix Table A.6. This critical value is 6.251. Since 1.473 is not at least 6.251, \(H_{0}\) cannot be rejected even at this rather large level of significance. The data is quite consistent with Mendel's laws. 

Consider the special case of just two categories, \(k=2\). The null hypothesis in this case can be stated as \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=p_{10}\), because the relations \(p_{2}=1-p_{1}\) and \(p_{20}=1-p_{10}\) make the inclusion of \(p_{2}=p_{20}\) in \(H_{0}\) redundant. The alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}\neq p_{10}\). These hypotheses can also be tested using a two-tailed \(z\) test with test statistic

\[Z=\frac{\left(N_{1}/n\right)-p_{10}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{10}(1-p_{10})}{n}}}=\frac{ \hat{p}_{1}-p_{10}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{10}\,p_{20}}{n}}}\]

Surprisingly, the two test procedures are completely equivalent. This is because it can be shown that \(Z^{2}=\chi^{2}\) and \(\left(z_{\text{a}/2}\right)^{2}=\chi^{2}_{\text{a},1}\), so that \(\chi^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{\text{a},1}\) if and only if (iff) \(|\text{Z}|\geq z_{\text{a}/2}\).1 If the alternative hypothesis is either \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}>p_{10}\) or \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(p_{1}<p_{10}\), the chi-squared test cannot be used. One must then revert to an upper- or lower-tailed \(z\) test.

Footnote 1: The fact that \(\left(z_{\text{a}/2}\right)^{2}=\chi^{2}_{\text{a},1}\) is a consequence of the relationship between the standard normal distribution and the chi-squared distribution with 1 df; if \(Z\sim N(0,\,1)\), then \(Z^{2}\) has a chi-squared distribution with \(n=1\). See the first proposition in Section 6.4.

As is the case with all test procedures, one must be careful not to confuse statistical significance with practical significance. A computed \(\chi^{2}\) that exceeds \(\chi^{2}_{\text{a},k-1}\) may be a result of a very large sample size rather than any practical differences between the hypothesized \(p_{i0}\)'s and true \(p_{i}\)'s. Thus if \(p_{10}=p_{20}=p_{30}=\frac{1}{3}\), but the true \(p_{i}\)'s have values.330,.340, and.330, a large value of \(\chi^{2}\) is sure to arise with a sufficiently large \(n\). Before rejecting \(H_{0}\), the \(\hat{p}_{i}\)'s should be examined to see whether they suggest a model different from that of \(H_{0}\) from a practical point of view.

### \(P\)-Values for Chi-Squared Tests

The chi-squared tests in this chapter are all upper-tailed, so we focus on this case. Just as the \(P\)-value for an upper-tailed \(t\) test is the area under the \(t\), curve to the right of the calculated \(t\), the \(P\)-value for an upper-tailed chi-squared test is the area under the \(\chi^{2}_{\text{v}}\) curve to the right of the calculated \(\chi^{2}\). Appendix Table A.6 provides limited \(P\)-value information because only five upper-tail critical values are tabulated for each different \(v\). We have therefore included Appendix Table A.10, analogous to Table A.7, that facilitates making more precise \(P\)-value statements.

The fact that \(t\) curves were all centered at zero allowed us to tabulate \(t\)-curve tail areas in a relatively compact way, with the left margin giving values ranging from 0.0 to 4.0 on the horizontal \(t\) scale and various columns displaying corresponding upper-tail areas for various df's. The rightward movement of chi-squared curves as df increases necessitates a somewhat different type of tabulation. The left margin of Appendix Table A.10 displays various upper-tail areas:.100,.095,.090,...,.005, and.001. Each column of the table is for a different value of df, and the entries are values on the horizontal chi-squared axis that capture these corresponding tail areas. For example, moving down to tail area.085 and across to the 4 df column, we see that the area to the right of 8.18 under the 4 df chi-squared curve is.085 (see Figure 13.2).

To capture this same upper-tail area under the 10 df curve, we must go out to 16.54. In the 2 df column, the top row shows that if the calculated value of the chi-squared variable is smaller than 4.60, the captured tail area (the \(P\)-value) exceeds.10. Similarly, the bottom row in this column indicates that if the calculated value exceeds 13.81, the tail area is smaller than.001 (\(P\)-value \(<\).001).

### \(\chi^{2}\) When the \(p_{i}\)'s Are Functions of Other Parameters

Frequently the \(p_{i}\)'s are hypothesized to depend on a smaller number of parameters \(\theta_{1}\),..., \(\theta_{m}\) (\(m<k\)). Then a specific hypothesis involving the \(\theta_{i}\)'s yields specific \(p_{i0}\)'s, which are then used in the \(\chi^{2}\) test.

In a well-known genetics article ("The Progeny in Generations F\({}_{12}\) to F\({}_{17}\) of a Cross Between a Yellow-Wrinkled and a Green-Round Seeded Pea," _J. Genet._, 1923: 255-331), the early statistician G. U. Yule analyzed data resulting from crossing garden peas. The dominant alleles in the experiment were Y = yellow color and R = round shape, resulting in the double dominant YR. Yule examined 269 four-seed pods resulting from a dihybrid cross and counted the number of YR seeds in each pod. Letting \(X\) denote the number of YR's in a randomly selected pod, possible \(X\) values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, which we identify with cells 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of a rectangular table (so, for example, a pod with \(X=4\) yields an observed count in cell 5).

The hypothesis that the Mendelian laws are operative and that genotypes of individual seeds within a pod are independent of one another implies that \(X\) has a binomial distribution with \(n=4\) and \(\theta=\frac{9}{16}\). We thus wish to test \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=p_{10}\),..., \(p_{5}=p_{50}\), where

\[p_{i0} =P(i-1\text{ YR's among 4 seeds when }H_{0}\text{ is true})\] \[=\binom{4}{i-1}\theta^{i-1}(1-\theta)^{4-(i-1)}\qquad\quad i=1,2, 3,4,5;\quad\theta=\frac{9}{16}\]

Figure 13.2: A \(P\)-value for an upper-tailed chi-squared test

Yule's data and the computations are in Table 13.3 with expected cell counts \(np_{t0}=269p_{t0}\).

Thus \(\chi^{2}=3.823+\cdot\cdot\cdot+.032=4.582\). Since \(\chi^{2}_{.01,k-1}=\chi^{2}_{.01,4}=13.277\), \(H_{0}\) is not rejected at level.01. Appendix Table A.10 shows that because \(4.582<7.77\), the \(P\)-value for the test exceeds.10. \(H_{0}\) should not be rejected at any reasonable significance level. 

### \(\chi^{2}\) When the Underlying Distribution Is Continuous

We have so far assumed that the \(k\) categories are naturally defined in the context of the experiment under consideration. The \(\chi^{2}\) test can also be used to test whether a sample comes from a specific underlying continuous distribution. Let \(X\) denote the variable being sampled and suppose the hypothesized pdf of \(X\) is \(f_{0}(x)\). As in the construction of a frequency distribution in Chapter 1, subdivide the measurement scale of \(X\) into \(k\) intervals \([a_{0},a_{1})\), \([a_{1},a_{2})\),..., \([a_{k-1},a_{k})\), where the interval \([a_{i-1},a_{i})\) includes the value \(a_{i-1}\) but not \(a_{i}\). The cell probabilities specified by \(H_{0}\) are then

\[p_{t0}=P(a_{i-1}\leq X<a_{i})=\int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_{i}}f_{0}(x)dx\]

The cells should be chosen so that \(np_{t0}\geq 5\) for \(i=1,\ldots,k\). Often they are selected so that the \(np_{t0}\)'s are equal.

To see whether the time of onset of labor among expectant mothers is uniformly distributed throughout a 24 h day, we can divide a day into \(k\) periods, each of length 24/\(k\). The null hypothesis states that \(f(x)\) is the uniform pdf on the interval [0, 24], so that \(p_{t0}=1/k\). The article "The Hour of Birth" (_Brit. J. Prevent. Social Med._, 1953: 43-59) reports on 1186 onset times, which were categorized into \(k=24\) 1-hour intervals beginning at midnight, resulting in cell counts of 52, 73, 89, 88, 68, 47, 58, 47, 48, 53, 47, 34, 21, 31, 40, 24, 37, 31, 47, 34, 36, 44, 78, and 59. Each expected cell count is 1186 \(\cdot\) 1/24 = 49.42, and the resulting value of \(\chi^{2}\) is 162.77. Since \(\chi^{2}_{.01,23}=41.637\), the computed value is highly significant, and the null hypothesis is resoundingly rejected. Generally speaking, it appears that labor is much more likely to commence very late at night than during normal waking hours. 

For testing whether a sample comes from a specific normal distribution, the fundamental parameters are \(\theta_{1}=\mu\) and \(\theta_{2}=\sigma\), and each \(p_{t0}\) will be a function of these parameters.

The developers of a new standardized exam want it to satisfy the following criteria: (1) actual time taken to complete the test is normally distributed, (2) \(\mu=100\) min, and (3) exactly 90% of all students will finish within a 2 h period. In the pilot testing of the standardized test, 120 students are given the test, and their completion times are recorded. For a chi-squared test of normally distributed completion time it is decided that \(k=8\) intervals should be used. The criteria imply that the 90th percentile of the completion time distribution is \(\mu+1.28\sigma=2\) h = 120 min. Since \(\mu=100\), this implies that \(\sigma=15.63\).

The eight intervals that divide the standard normal scale into eight equally likely segments are [0,.32), [.32,.675), [.675, 1.15), [1.15, \(\infty\)), and their four counterparts on the other side of 0. For \(\mu=100\) and \(\sigma=15.63\), these intervals become [100, 105), [105, 110.55), [110.55, 117.97), and [117.97, \(\infty\)). Thus \(p_{i0}=\frac{1}{8}=.125\) (\(i=1,\ldots,8\)), from which each expected cell count is \(np_{i0}=120(.125)=15\). The observed cell counts were 21, 17, 12, 16, 10, 15, 19, and 10, resulting in a \(\chi^{2}\) of 7.73. Since \(\chi^{2}_{.10,7}=12.017\) and 7.73 is not \(\geq 12.017\), there is no evidence for concluding that the criteria have not been met.

The article "A Genetic and Biochemical Study on Pericarp Pigments in a Cross Between Two Cultivars of Grain Sorghum, Sorghum Bicolor" (_Heredity_, 1976: 413-416) reports on an experiment that involved an initial cross between CK60 sorghum (an American variety with white seeds) and Abu Taima (an Ethiopian variety with yellow seeds) to produce plants with red seeds and then a self-cross of the red-seeded plants. According to genetic theory, this \(F\)2 cross should produce plants with red, yellow, or white seeds in the ratio 9:3:4. The data from the experiment follows; does the data confirm or contradict the genetic theory? Test at level.05 using the _P_-value approach. 

**0.**: Show that another expression for the chi-squared statistic is

Why is it more efficient to compute \(\chi^{2}\) using this formula?
**b.**: When the null hypothesis is \(H\)0: \(p\)1 = \(p\)2 = \(p\)2 = _p_k = 1/_k_ (i.e., \(p\)0 = 1/_k_ for all _i_), how does the formula of part (a) simplify? Use the simplified expression to calculate \(\chi^{2}\) for the pigeon/direction data in Exercise 4.
**11.**: Having obtained a random sample from a population, you wish to use a chi-squared test to decide whether the population distribution is standard normal. If you base the test on six class intervals having equal probability under \(H\)0, what should the class intervals be?
**b.**: If you wish to use a chi-squared test to test \(H\)0: the population distribution is normal with \(m\) =.5, \(s\) =.002 and the test is to be based on six equiprobable (under \(H\)0) class intervals, what should these intervals be?
**c.**: Use the chi-squared test with the intervals of part (b) to decide, based on the following 45 bolt diameters, whether bolt diameter is a normally distributed variable with \(m\) =.5 in., \(s\) =.002 in.

### 13.2 Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Composite Hypotheses

In the previous section, we presented a goodness-of-fit test based on a \(\chi^{2}\) statistic for deciding between \(H_{0}\): \(p_{1}=p_{10}\),..., \(p_{k}=p_{k0}\) and the alternative \(H_{\text{a}}\) stating that \(H_{0}\) is not true. The null hypothesis was a _simple_ hypothesis in the sense that each \(p_{i0}\) was a specified number, so that the expected cell counts when \(H_{0}\) was true were uniquely determined numbers.

In many situations, there are \(k\) naturally occurring categories, but \(H_{0}\) states only that the \(p_{i}\)'s are functions of other parameters \(\theta_{1}\),..., \(\theta_{m}\) without specifying the values of these \(\theta\)'s. For example, a population may be in equilibrium with respect to proportions of the three genotypes AA, Aa, and aa. With \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\), and \(p_{3}\) denoting these proportions (probabilities), one may wish to test

\[H_{0}:p_{1}=\theta^{2},p_{2}=2\theta(1-\theta),p_{3}=(1-\theta)^{2} \tag{13.1}\]

where \(\theta\) represents the proportion of gene A in the population. This hypothesis is **composite** because knowing that \(H_{0}\) is true does not uniquely determine the cell probabilities and expected cell counts but only their general form. To carry out a \(\chi^{2}\) test, the unknown \(\theta_{i}\)'s must first be estimated.

Similarly, we may be interested in testing to see whether a sample came from a particular family of distributions without specifying any particular member of the family. To use the \(\chi^{2}\) test to see whether the distribution is Poisson, for example, the parameter \(\lambda\) must be estimated. In addition, because there are actually an infinite number of possible values of a Poisson variable, these values must be grouped so that there are a finite number of cells. If \(H_{0}\) states that the underlying distribution is normal, use of a \(\chi^{2}\) test must be preceded by a choice of cells and estimation of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\).

### 13.2 When Parameters Are Estimated

As before, \(k\) will denote the number of categories or cells and \(p_{i}\) will denote the probability of an observation falling in the \(i\)th cell. The null hypothesis now states that each \(p_{i}\) is a function of a small number of parameters \(\theta_{1}\),..., \(\theta_{m}\) with the \(\theta_{i}\)'s otherwise unspecified:

\[\begin{array}{l}H_{0}:p_{1}=\pi_{1}(\boldsymbol{\theta}),\ldots,p_{k}=\pi_{k} (\boldsymbol{\theta})\quad\text{where}\,\boldsymbol{\theta}=(\theta_{1}, \ldots,\theta_{m})\\ H_{\text{a}}:\text{the hypothesis}\,H_{0}\text{ is not true}\end{array} \tag{13.2}\]

For example, for \(H_{0}\) of (13.1), \(m=1\) (there is only one \(\theta\)), \(\pi_{1}(\theta)=\theta\)[2], \(\pi_{2}(\theta)=2\theta(1-\theta)\), and \(\pi_{3}(\theta)=(1-\theta)^{2}\).

In the case \(k=2\), there is really only a single rv, \(N_{1}\) (since \(N_{1}+N_{2}=n\)), which has a binomial distribution. The joint probability that \(N_{1}=n_{1}\) and \(N_{2}=n_{2}\) is then

\[P(N_{1}=n_{1},N_{2}=n_{2})=\left(\begin{array}{c}n\\ n_{1}\end{array}\right)p_{1}^{n_{1}}\,p_{2}^{n_{2}}\propto p_{1}^{n_{1}}\,p_{2} ^{n_{2}}\]where \(p_{1}\) + \(p_{2}\) = 1 and \(n_{1}\) + \(n_{2}\) = \(n\). For general \(k\), the joint distribution of \(N_{1}\),..., \(N_{k}\) is the multinomial distribution (Section 5.1) with

\[P(N_{1}=n_{1},...,N_{k}=n_{k})\propto p_{1}^{n_{1}}\,p_{2}^{n_{2}}\cdot\cdots \cdot p_{k}^{n_{k}} \tag{13.3}\]

When \(H_{0}\) is true, (13.3) becomes

\[P(N_{1}=n_{1},...,N_{k}=n_{k})\propto[\pi_{1}(\boldsymbol{\theta})]^{n_{1}} \cdot\ldots\cdot[\pi_{k}(\boldsymbol{\theta})]^{n_{k}} \tag{13.4}\]

To apply a chi-squared test, \(\theta\) = (\(\theta_{1}\),..., \(\theta_{m}\)) must be estimated.

Let \(n_{1}\), \(n_{2}\),..., \(n_{k}\) denote the observed values of \(N_{1}\),..., \(N_{k}\). Then \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\),..., \(\hat{\theta}_{m}\) are those values of the \(\theta_{i}\)'s that maximize (13.4), that is, the maximum likelihood estimators (Section 7.2).

In humans there is a blood group, the MN group, that is composed of individuals having one of the three blood types M, MN, and N. Type is determined by two alleles, and there is no dominance, so the three possible genotypes give rise to three phenotypes. A population consisting of individuals in the MN group is in equilibrium if

\[\begin{array}{l}P(\text{M})=p_{1}=\theta^{2}\\ P(\text{MN})=p_{2}=2\theta(1-\theta)\\ P(\text{N})=p_{3}=(1-\theta)^{2}\end{array}\]

for some \(\theta\). Suppose a sample from such a population yielded the results shown in Table 13.4.

Then

\[\begin{array}{l}[\pi_{1}(\theta)]^{n_{1}}[\pi_{2}(\theta)]^{n_{2}}[\pi_{3}( \theta)]^{n_{3}}=[\theta^{2}]^{n_{1}}[2\theta(1-\theta)]^{n_{2}}[(1-\theta)^{2 }]^{n_{3}}\\ =2^{n_{2}}\cdot\theta^{2n_{1}+n_{2}}\cdot(1-\theta)^{n_{2}+2n_{3}}\end{array}\]

Maximizing this with respect to \(\theta\) (or, equivalently, maximizing the natural logarithm of this quantity, which is easier to differentiate) yields

\[\hat{\theta}=\frac{2n_{1}+n_{2}}{[(2n_{1}+n_{2})+(n_{2}+2n_{3})]}=\frac{2n_{1} +n_{2}}{2n}\]

With \(n_{1}\) = 125 and \(n_{2}\) = 225, \(\hat{\theta}\) = 475/1000 =.475.

Once \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) = (\(\theta_{1}\),..., \(\theta_{m}\)) has been estimated by \(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\) = (\(\hat{\theta}_{1}\),..., \(\hat{\theta}_{m}\)), the estimated expected cell counts are the \(n\pi_{i}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})\)'s. These are now used in place of the \(np_{\ell 0}\)'s of Section 13.1 to specify a \(\chi^{2}\) statistic.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Type:** & **M** & **MN** & **M** \\ \cline{2-4} Observed & 125 & 225 & 150 & \(n\) = 500 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.4: Observed counts for Example 13.5Under general "regularity" conditions on \(\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{m}\) and the \(\pi_{i}(\hat{\theta})\)'s, if \(\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{m}\) are estimated by the method of maximum likelihood as described previously and \(n\) is large,

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{\text{all cells}}\frac{(\text{observed}-\text{estimated expected})^{2}}{\text{expected}}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{\left[N_{i}-n\pi_{i}(\hat{\theta})\right]^{2}}{n\pi_{i}(\hat{\theta})}\]

has approximately a chi-squared distribution with \(k-1-m\) df when \(H_{0}\) of (13.2) is true. An approximately level \(\alpha\) test of \(H_{0}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\) is then to reject \(H_{0}\) if \(\chi^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{s,k-1-m}\). In practice, the test can be used if \(n\pi_{i}(\hat{\theta})\geq 5\) for every \(i\).

Notice that _the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by the number of \(\theta_{i}\)'s estimated_.

With \(\hat{\theta}=.475\) and \(n=500\), the estimated expected cell counts are \(n\pi_{1}(\hat{\theta})=500(\hat{\theta})^{2}=112.81,\)\(n\pi_{2}(\hat{\theta})=(500)(2)(.475)(1-.475)=249.38,\) and \(n\pi_{3}(\hat{\theta})=500-112.81-249.38=137.81\). Then

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{\left(125-112.81\right)^{2}}{112.81}+\frac{\left(225-249.38 \right)^{2}}{249.38}+\frac{\left(150-137.81\right)^{2}}{137.81}=4.78\]

Since \(\chi^{2}_{.05,k-1-m}=\chi^{2}_{.05,3-1-1}=\chi^{2}_{.05,1}=3.843\) and \(4.78\geq 3.843\), \(H_{0}\) is rejected. Appendix Table A.10 shows that \(P\)-value \(\approx.029\).

Consider a series of games between two teams, I and II, that terminates as soon as one team has won four games (with no possibility of a tie). A simple probability model for such a series assumes that outcomes of successive games are independent and that the probability of team I winning any particular game is a constant \(\theta\). We arbitrarily designate I the better team, so that \(\theta\geq.5\). Any particular series can then terminate after 4, 5, 6, or 7 games. Let \(\pi_{1}(\theta)\), \(\pi_{2}(\theta)\), \(\pi_{3}(\theta)\), \(\pi_{4}(\theta)\) denote the probability of termination in 4, 5, 6, and 7 games, respectively. Then

\[\pi_{1}(\theta) =P(\text{I wins in 4 games})+P(\text{II wins in 4 games})\] \[=\theta^{4}+(1-\theta)^{4}\] \[\pi_{2}(\theta) =P(\text{I wins 3 of the first 4 and the fifth})\] \[\quad+P(\text{I loses 3 of the first 4 and the fifth})\] \[=\binom{4}{3}\theta^{3}(1-\theta)\cdot\theta+\binom{4}{1}\theta( 1-\theta)^{3}\cdot(1-\theta)\] \[=4\theta(1-\theta)\Big{[}\theta^{3}+(1-\theta)^{3}\Big{]}\] \[\pi_{3}(\theta) =10\theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{2}[\theta^{2}+(1-\theta)^{2}]\] \[\pi_{4}(\theta) =20\theta^{3}(1-\theta)^{3}\]

The article "Seven-Game Series in Sports" by Groeneveld and Meeden (_Math. Mag._, 1975: 187-192) tested the fit of this model to results of NationalHockey League playoffs during the period 1943-1967 (when league membership was stable). The data appears in Table 13.5.

The estimated expected cell counts are 83\(\pi_{i}(\hat{\theta})\), where \(\hat{\theta}\) is the value of \(\theta\) that maximizes

\[\Big{\{}\theta^{4}+(1-\theta)^{4}\Big{\}}^{15}\cdot\Big{\{}4\theta (1-\theta)\Big{[}\theta^{3}+(1-\theta)^{3}\Big{]}\Big{\}}^{26}\] \[\cdot\Big{\{}10\theta^{2}(1-\theta)^{2}\Big{[}\theta^{2}+(1- \theta)^{2}\Big{]}\Big{\}}^{24}\cdot\Big{\{}20\theta^{3}(1-\theta)^{3}\Big{\}}^ {18} \tag{13.5}\]

Standard calculus methods fail to yield a nice formula for the maximizing value \(\hat{\theta}\), so it must be computed using numerical methods. The result is \(\hat{\theta}=.654\), from which \(\pi_{i}(\hat{\theta})\) and the estimated expected cell counts are computed. The computed value of \(\chi^{2}\) is.360, and (since \(k-1-m=4-1-1=2\)) \(\chi^{2}_{10,2}=4.605\). There is thus no reason to reject the simple model as applied to NHL playoff series.

The cited article also considered World Series data for the period 1903-1973. For the simple model, \(\chi^{2}=5.97\), so the model does not seem appropriate. The suggested reason for this is that for the simple model

\[P(\text{series lasts six games}\mid\text{series lasts at least six games})\ \geq\.5 \tag{13.6}\]

whereas of the 38 series that actually lasted at least six games, only 13 lasted exactly six. The following alternative model is then introduced:

\[\pi_{1}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2}) =\theta_{1}^{4}+(1-\theta_{1})^{4}\] \[\pi_{2}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2}) =4\theta_{1}(1-\theta_{1})[\theta_{1}^{3}+(1-\theta_{1})^{3}]\] \[\pi_{3}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2}) =10\theta_{1}^{2}(1-\theta_{1})^{2}\theta_{2}\] \[\pi_{4}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2}) =10\theta_{1}^{2}(1-\theta_{1})^{2}(1-\theta_{2})\]

The first two \(\pi_{i}\)'s are identical to the simple model, whereas \(\theta_{2}\) is the conditional probability of (13.6) (which can now be any number between zero and one). The values of \(\hat{\theta}_{1}\) and \(\hat{\theta}_{2}\) that maximize the expression analogous to expression (13.5) are determined numerically as \(\hat{\theta}_{1}=.614\), \(\hat{\theta}_{2}=.342\). A summary appears in Table 13.6, and \(\chi^{2}=.384\). Two parameters are estimated, so \(\text{df}=k-1-m=1\) with \(\chi^{2}_{10,1}=2.706\), indicating a good fit of the data to this new model.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Number of games played:**} & **4** & **5** & **6** & **7** \\ \cline{2-5}  & 12 & 16 & 13 & 25 \\ \cline{2-5} Estimated Expected Frequency & 10.85 & 18.08 & 12.68 & 24.39 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.6: Observed and expected counts for the more complex model One of the regularity conditions on the \(\theta_{i}\)'s in the theorem is that they be functionally independent of one another. That is, no single \(\theta_{i}\) can be determined from the values of other \(\theta_{i}\)'s, so that \(m\) is the number of functionally independent parameters estimated. A general rule of thumb for degrees of freedom in a chi-squared test is the following.

\[\chi^{2}\ \mathrm{df}\ =\left(\begin{array}{c}\mathrm{number\ of\ freely}\\ \mathrm{determined\ cell\ counts}\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c} \mathrm{number\ of\ independent}\\ \mathrm{parameters\ estimated}\end{array}\right)\]

This rule will be used in connection with several different chi-squared tests in the next section.

### Goodness of Fit for Discrete Distributions

Many experiments involve observing a random sample \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\) from some discrete distribution. One may then wish to investigate whether the underlying distribution is a member of a particular family, such as the Poisson or negative binomial family. In the case of both a Poisson and a negative binomial distribution, the set of possible values is infinite, so the values must be grouped into \(k\) subsets before a chi-squared test can be used. The groupings should be done so that the expected frequency in each cell (group) is at least 5. The last cell will then correspond to \(X\) values of \(c\), \(c+1\), \(c+2\), \(\ldots\) for some value \(c\).

This grouping can considerably complicate the computation of the \(\hat{\theta}_{i}\)'s and estimated expected cell counts. This is because the theorem requires that the \(\hat{\theta}_{i}\)'s be obtained from the cell counts \(N_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(N_{k}\) rather than the sample values \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\).

The author fit a Poisson distribution to the data. Let \(\lambda\) denote the Poisson parameter and suppose for the moment that the six counts in cell 5 were actually 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6. Then denoting sample values by \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\),\(x_{48}\), nine of the \(x_{i}\)'s were 0, nine were 1, and so on. The likelihood of the observed sample is

\[\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{x_{1}}}{x_{1}!}\cdot\ldots\cdot\frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{x_{48}}}{x_{48}!}=\frac{e^{-48\lambda}\hat{\lambda}^{\Sigma x_{i}}}{x _{1}!\cdot\ldots\cdot x_{48}!}=\frac{e^{-48\lambda}\hat{\lambda}^{101}}{x_{1}! \cdot\ldots\cdot x_{48}!}\]

The value of \(\lambda\) for which this is maximized is \(\hat{\lambda}=x_{i}/n=101/48=2.10\) (the value reported in the article).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Cell:** & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** \\
**Number of plants:** & **0** & **1** & **2** & **3** & \(\cong\)**4** \\ \cline{2-6} Frequency & 9 & 9 & 10 & 14 & 6 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.7: Observed counts for Example 13.8However, the \(\hat{\lambda}\) required for \(\chi^{2}\) is obtained by maximizing Expression (13.4) rather than the likelihood of the full sample. The cell probabilities are

\[\pi_{i}(\lambda)= \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{i-1}}{(i-1)!}\qquad i=1,2,3,4\] \[\pi_{5}(\lambda)= 1-\sum_{i=0}^{3}\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{i}}{i!}\]

so the right-hand side of (13.4) becomes

\[\left[\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{0}}{0!}\right]^{9}\left[\frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^{1}}{1!}\right]^{9}\left[\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{2}}{2!}\right]^{10 }\left[\frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{3}}{3!}\right]^{14}\left[1-\sum_{i=0}^{3} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{i}}{i!}\right]^{6} \tag{13.7}\]

There is no nice formula for \(\hat{\lambda}\), the maximizing value of \(\lambda\) in this latter expression, so it must be obtained numerically. \(\blacksquare\)

_Because the parameter estimates are usually much more difficult to compute from the grouped data than from the full sample_, _they are often computed using this latter method_. When these "full" estimators are used in the chi-squared statistic, the distribution of the statistic is altered and a level \(\alpha\) test is no longer specified by the critical value \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1-m}\)

\begin{tabular}{c c} THEOREM & Let \(\hat{\theta}_{1},\ldots,\hat{\theta}_{m}\) be the maximum likelihood estimators of \(\theta_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(\theta_{m}\) based on the full sample \(X_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(X_{n}\), and let \(\chi^{2}\) denote the statistic based on these estimators. Then the critical value \(c_{\alpha}\) that specifies a level \(\alpha\) upper-tailed test satisfies \\  & \[\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1-m}\leq c_{\alpha}\leq\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1}\] (13.8) \\ \end{tabular}

The test procedure implied by this theorem is the following:

\[\text{If }\chi^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1},\text{ reject }H_{0}.\] \[\text{If }\chi^{2}\leq\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1-m},\text{ do not reject }H_{0}. \tag{13.9}\]

\[\text{If }\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1-m}<\chi^{2}<\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1},\text{ withhold judgment}.\]Using \(\hat{\lambda}=2.10\), the estimated expected cell counts are computed from \(n\pi_{i}(\hat{\lambda})\), where \(n=48\). For example,

\[n\pi_{1}(\hat{\lambda})=48\cdot\frac{e^{-2.1}(2.1)^{0}}{0!}=(48)(e^{-2.1})=5.88\]

Similarly, \(n\pi_{2}(\hat{\lambda})=12.34\), \(n\pi_{3}(\hat{\lambda})=12.96\), \(n\pi_{4}(\hat{\lambda})=9.07\), and \(n\pi_{5}(\hat{\lambda})=48-5.88-\cdots-9.07=7.75\). Then

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{(9-5.88)^{2}}{5.88}+\cdots+\frac{(6-7.75)^{2}}{7.75}=6.31\]

Since \(m=1\) and \(k=5\), at level.05 we need \(\chi^{2}_{.05,3}=7.815\) and \(\chi^{2}_{.05,4}=9.488\). Because \(6.31\leq 7.815\), we do not reject \(H_{0}\); at the 5% level, the Poisson distribution provides a reasonable fit to the data. Notice that \(\chi^{2}_{.10,3}=6.251\) and \(\chi^{2}_{.10,4}=7.779\), so at level.10 we would have to withhold judgment on whether the Poisson distribution was appropriate.

For comparison we can with a little additional effort maximize Expression (13.7). Use of a graphing calculator gives \(\hat{\lambda}=2.047\). Because this differs very little from 2.10, there is little change in the results. Using 2.047, we get the estimated expected cell counts 6.197, 12.687, 12.985, 8.860, and 7.271, and the resulting value of \(\chi^{2}\) is 6.230. Comparing this with \(\chi^{2}_{.05,3}=7.815\), we do not reject the Poisson null hypothesis at the.05 level. Because 6.230 does not quite exceed \(\chi^{2}_{.10,3}=6.251\), we also do not reject the null hypothesis at the 10% level. 

Sometimes even the maximum likelihood estimates based on the full sample are quite difficult to compute. This is the case, for example, for the two-parameter (generalized) negative binomial distribution. In such situations, method-of-moments estimates are often used and the resulting \(\chi^{2}\) compared to \(\chi^{2}_{\alpha,k-1-m}\), although it is not known to what extent the use of moments estimators affects the true critical value.

## Goodness of Fit for Continuous Distributions

The chi-squared test can also be used to test whether the sample comes from a specified family of continuous distributions, such as the exponential family or the normal family. The choice of cells (class intervals) is even more arbitrary in the continuous case than in the discrete case. To ensure that the chi-squared test is valid, the cells should be chosen independently of the sample observations. Once the cells are chosen, it is almost always quite difficult to estimate unspecified parameters (such as \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) in the normal case) from the observed cell counts, so instead mle's based on the full sample are computed. The critical value \(c_{x}\) again satisfies (13.8), and the test procedure is given by (13.9).

The Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) has carried out extensive dietary studies and research projects in Central America. In one study reported in the November 1964 issue of the _American Journal of Clinical Nutrition_ ("The Blood Viscosity of Various Socioeconomic Groups in Guatemala"), serum 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:752]

The authors postulated a truncated exponential distribution:

\[H_{0}:f(x)=\frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda x}}{1-e^{-\lambda x_{0}}}\qquad 0\leq x\leq x_{0}\]

The mean of this distribution is

\[\mu=\int_{0}^{x_{0}}xf(x)dx=\frac{1}{\lambda}-\frac{x_{0}e^{-\lambda x_{0}}}{1- e^{-\lambda x_{0}}}\]

The parameter \(\lambda\) was estimated by replacing \(\mu\) by \(\bar{x}=13.086\) and solving the resulting equation to obtain \(\hat{\lambda}=.0742\) (so \(\hat{\lambda}\) is a method-of-moments estimate and not an mle). Then with \(\hat{\lambda}\) replacing \(\lambda\) in \(f(x)\), the estimated expected cell frequencies as displayed previously are computed as

\[40\hat{\pi}_{i}(\hat{\lambda})=40P(a_{i-1}\leq X{<}a_{i})=40\int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_ {i}}f(x)dx=\frac{40(e^{-\hat{\lambda}a_{i-1}}-e^{-\hat{\lambda}a_{i}})}{1-e^{- \lambda x_{0}}}\]

where [\(a_{i-1}\), \(a_{i}\)) is the \(i\)th class interval. To obtain expected cell counts of at least 5, the last six cells are combined to yield observed counts 20, 8, 7, 5 and expected counts of 18.0, 9.9, 5.5, 6.6. The computed value of chi-squared is then \(\chi^{2}=1.34\). Because \(\chi^{2}_{.05,2}=5.992\), \(H_{0}\) is not rejected, so the truncated exponential model provides a good fit. \(\blacksquare\)

### A Special Test for Normality

Probability plots were introduced in Section 4.7 as an informal method for assessing the plausibility of any specified population distribution as the one from which the given sample was selected. The straighter the probability plot, the more plausible is the distribution on which the plot is based. A normal probability plot is used for checking whether _any_ member of the normal distribution family is plausible. Let's denote the sample \(x_{i}\)'s when ordered from smallest to largest by \(x_{(1)}\), \(x_{(2)}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{(n)}\). Then the plot suggested for checking normality was a plot of the points (\(x_{(i)}\), \(y_{i}\)), where \(y_{i}=\Phi^{-1}[(i-.5)/n]\).

A quantitative measure of the extent to which points cluster about a straight line is the sample correlation coefficient \(r\) introduced in Chapter 12. Consider calculating \(r\) for the \(n\) pairs (\(x_{(1)}\), \(y_{1}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(x_{(n)}\), \(y_{n}\)). The \(y_{i}\)'s here are not observed values in a random sample from a \(y\) population, so properties of this \(r\) are quite different from those described in Section 12.5. However, it is true that the more \(r\) deviates from one, the less the probability plot resembles a straight line (remember that a probability plot must slope upward). This idea can be extended to yield a formal test procedure: Reject the hypothesis of population normality if \(r\leq c_{\alpha}\), where \(c_{\alpha}\) is a critical value chosen to yield the desired significance level \(\alpha\). That is, the critical value is chosen so that when the population distribution is actually normal, the probability of obtaining an \(r\) value that is at most \(c_{\alpha}\) (and thus incorrectly rejecting \(H_{0}\)) is the desired \(\alpha\). The developers of the MINITAB statistical computer package give critical values for \(\alpha=.10\),.05, and.01 in combination with different sample sizes. Because no theory exists for the distribution of \(r\) for a normal plot, the critical values are determined by computer simulation. These critical values are based on a slightly different definition of the \(y_{i}\)'s than that given previously. The new values give slightly better approximations to the expected values of the ordered normal observations.

MINITAB will also construct a normal probability plot based on these \(y_{i}\)'s. The plot will be almost identical in appearance to that based on the previous \(y_{i}\)'s.

When there are several tied \(x_{(i)}\)'s, MINITAB computes \(r\) by using the average of the corresponding \(y_{i}\)'s as the second number in each pair.

Let \(y_{i}=\Phi^{-1}[(i-.375)/(n+.25)]\) and compute the sample correlation coefficient \(r\) for the \(n\) pairs (\(x_{(1)}\), \(y_{1}\)), \(\ldots\), (\(x_{(n)}\), \(y_{n}\)). The Ryan-Joiner test of

\(H_{0}\): the population distribution is normal

versus

\(H_{\alpha}\): the population distribution is not normal

consists of rejecting \(H_{0}\) when \(r\leq c_{\alpha}\). Critical values \(c_{\alpha}\) are given in Appendix Table A.11 for various significance levels \(\alpha\) and sample sizes \(n\).

The following sample of \(n=20\) observations on dielectric breakdown voltage of a piece of epoxy resin first appeared in Example 4.36.

The test statistic value is \(r=.9881\), and Appendix Table A.11 gives.9600 as the critical value that captures lower-tail area.10 under the \(r\) sampling distribution curve when \(n=20\) and the underlying distribution is actually normal. Since.9881 \(>.9600\), the null hypothesis of normality cannot be rejected even for a significance level as large as.10.

19. Each headlight on an automobile undergoing an annual vehicle inspection can be focused either too high (_H_), too low (_L_), or properly (_N_). Checking the two headlights simultaneously (and not distinguishing between left and right) results in the six possible outcomes _HH_, _LL_, _NN_, _HL_, _HN_, and _LN_. If the probabilities (population proportions) for the single headlight focus direction are _P_(_H_) = \(\theta_{1}\), _P_(_L_) = \(\theta_{2}\), and _P_(_N_) = 1 - \(\theta_{1}\) - \(\theta_{2}\) and the two headlights are focused independently of each other, the probabilities of the six outcomes for a randomly selected car are the following: \[p_{1} = \theta_{1}^{2}\quad p_{2} = \theta_{2}^{2}\quad p_{3} = \left( {1 - \theta_{1} - \theta_{2}} \right)^{2}\] \[p_{4} = 2\theta_{1}\theta_{2}\quad p_{5} = 2\theta_{1} (1 - \theta_{1} - \theta_{2})\] \[p_{6} = 2\theta_{2} (1 - \theta_{1} - \theta_{2})\] Use the accompanying data to test the null hypothesis \[H_{0} : p_{1} = \pi_{1} (\theta_{1},\theta_{2}),...,p_{6} = \pi_{6} (\theta_{1},\theta_{2})\] where the \(\pi_{i}\)(\(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\))'s are given previously.

### 13.3 Two-Way Contingency Tables

In the previous two sections, we discussed inferential problems in which the count data was displayed in a rectangular table of cells. Each table consisted of one row and a specified number of columns, where the columns corresponded to categories into which the population had been divided. We now study problems in which the data also consists of counts or frequencies, but the data table will now have \(I\) rows (\(I\geq 2\)) and \(J\) columns, so \(IJ\) cells. There are two commonly encountered situations in which such data arises:

1. There are \(I\) populations of interest, each corresponding to a different row of the table, and each population is divided into the same \(J\) categories. A sample is taken from the \(i\)th population (\(i=1\), \(\ldots\), \(I\)), and the counts are entered in the cells in the \(i\)th row of the table. For example, customers of each of \(I=3\) department store chains might have available the same \(J=5\) payment categories: cash, check, store credit card, Visa, and MasterCard.
2. There is a single population of interest, with each individual in the population categorized with respect to two different factors. There are \(I\) categories associated with the first factor, and \(J\) categories associated with the second factor. A single sample is taken, and the number of individuals belonging in both category \(i\) of factor 1 and category \(j\) of factor 2 is entered in the cell in row \(i\), column \(j\) (\(i=1\), \(\ldots\), \(I\); \(j=1\), \(\ldots\), \(J\)). As an example, customers making a purchase might be classified according to both department in which the purchase was made, with \(I=6\) departments, and according to method of payment, with \(J=5\) as in (1) above.

Let \(n_{ij}\) denote the number of individuals in the sample(s) falling in the \((i,j)\)th cell (row \(i\), column \(j\)) of the table--that is, the \((i,j)\)th cell count. The table displaying the \(n_{ij}\)s is called a **two-way contingency table;** a prototype is shown in Table 13.9.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline  & **1** & **2** & **\(\cdots\)** & \(j\)** & **\(\cdots\)** & \(J\)** \\
**1** & \(n_{11}\) & \(n_{12}\) & \(\cdots\) & \(n_{1j}\) & \(\cdots\) & \(n_{1J}\) \\
**2** & \(n_{21}\) & & & & & \(\vdots\) \\ ⋮ & ⋮ & & & & & \\ \cline{2-8} \(i\) & \(n_{11}\) & \(\cdots\) & & \(n_{ij}\) & \(\cdots\) & \\ ⋮ & ⋮ & & & & & \\ \cline{2-8} \(I\) & \(n_{11}\) & \(\cdots\) & & & & \(n_{IJ}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.9: A two-way contingency table In situations of type 1, we want to investigate whether the proportions in the different categories are the same for all populations. The null hypothesis states that the populations are _homogeneous_ with respect to these categories. In type 2 situations, we investigate whether the categories of the two factors occur independently of each other in the population.

## Testing for Homogeneity

We assume that each individual in every one of the \(I\) populations belongs in exactly one of \(J\) categories. A sample of \(n_{i}\) individuals is taken from the \(i\)th population; let \(n=\sum n_{i}\) and

\(n_{ij}=\) the number of individuals in the \(i\)th sample who fall into category \(j\)

\(n_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}n_{ij}=\) the total number of individuals among the \(n\) sampled who fall into category \(j\)

The \(n_{ij}\)'s are recorded in a two-way contingency table with \(I\) rows and \(J\) columns. The sum of the \(n_{ij}\)'s in the \(i\)th row is \(n_{i}\), whereas the sum of entries in the \(j\)th column is \(n_{j}\).

Let

\(p_{ij}=\) the proportion of the individuals in population \(i\) who fall into category \(j\)

Thus, for population 1, the \(J\) proportions are \(p_{11},p_{12},\ldots,p_{1J}\) (which sum to 1) and similarly for the other populations. The **null hypothesis of homogeneity** states that the proportion of individuals in category \(j\) is the same for each population and that this is true for every category; that is, for every \(j\), \(p_{1j}=p_{2j}=\cdots=p_{Ij}\).

When \(H_{0}\) is true, we can use \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\), \(\ldots\), \(p_{J}\) to denote the population proportions in the \(J\) different categories; these proportions are common to all \(I\) populations. The expected number of individuals in the \(i\)th sample who fall in the \(j\)th category when \(H_{0}\) is true is then \(E(N_{ij})=n_{i}\cdot p_{j}\). To estimate \(E(N_{ij})\), we must first estimate \(p_{j}\), the proportion in category \(j\). Among the total sample of \(n\) individuals, \(N_{j}\) fall into category \(j\), so we use \(\hat{p}_{j}=N_{j}/n\) as the estimator (this can be shown to be the maximum likelihood estimator of \(p_{j}\)). Substitution of the estimate \(\hat{p}_{j}\) for \(p_{j}\) in \(n\hat{p}_{j}\) yields a simple formula for estimated expected counts under \(H_{0}\):

\[\begin{split}\hat{e}_{ij}&=\text{estimated expected count in cell }(i,j)=n_{i}\cdot\frac{n_{j}}{n}\\ &=\frac{(i\text{th row total})(j\text{th column total})}{n}\end{split} \tag{13.10}\]

The test statistic also has the same form as in previous problem situations. The number of degrees of freedom comes from the general rule of thumb. In each row of Table 13.9 there are \(J-1\) freely determined cell counts (each sample size \(n_{i}\) is fixed), so there are a total of \(I(J-1)\) freely determined cells. Parameters \(p_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(p_{J}\) are estimated, but because \(\Sigma p_{i}=1\), only \(J-1\) of these are independent. Thus \(\text{df}=I(J-1)-(J-1)=(J-1)(I-1)\).

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}:p_{1j}=p_{2j}=\cdots=p_{ij}\quad j=1,2,\ldots,J\) \\ Alternative hypothesis: \(H_{\text{a}}:H_{0}\) is not true \\ Test statistic value: \\ \(\chi^{2}=\sum_{\text{all cells}}\frac{\left(\text{observed}-\text{estimated expected}\right)^{2}}{\text{estimated expected}}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\frac{\left(n_{ij}-\hat{e}_{ij}\right)^{2}}{\hat{e}_{ij}}\) \\ Rejection region: \(\chi^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{\text{a},J-1,J-1}\) \\ \(P\)-value information can be obtained as described in Section 13.1. The test can safely be applied as long as \(\hat{e}_{ij}\geq 5\) for all cells. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

A company packages a particular product in cans of three different sizes, each one using a different production line. Most cans conform to specifications, but a quality control engineer has identified the following reasons for nonconformance: (1) blemish on can; (2) crack in can; (3) improper pull tab location; (4) pull tab missing; (5) other. A sample of nonconforming units is selected from each of the three lines, and each unit is categorized according to reason for nonconformity, resulting in the following contingency table data:

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l} \hline \hline  & & \multicolumn{4}{c}{**Reason for Nonconformity**} \\ \cline{3-8}  & & **Blemish** & **Crack** & **Location** & **Missing** & **Other** & **Sample Size** \\ \hline
**Production** & **1** & 34 & 65 & 17 & 21 & 13 & 150 \\
**Line** & **2** & 23 & 52 & 25 & 19 & 6 & 125 \\
**3** & 32 & 28 & 16 & 14 & 10 & 100 \\
**Total** & 89 & 145 & 58 & 54 & 29 & 375 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Does the data suggest that the proportions falling in the various nonconformance categories are not the same for the three lines? The parameters of interest are the various proportions, and the relevant hypotheses are

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l} \hline \hline  & & \multicolumn{4}{c}{**Reason for Nonconformity**} \\ \cline{3-8}  & & **Blemish** & **Crack** & **Location** & **Missing** & **Other** & **Sample Size** \\ \hline
**Production** & **1** & 34 & 65 & 17 & 21 & 13 & 150 \\
**Line** & **2** & 23 & 52 & 25 & 19 & 6 & 125 \\
**3** & 32 & 28 & 16 & 14 & 10 & 100 \\
**Total** & 89 & 145 & 58 & 54 & 29 & 375 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The estimated expected frequencies (assuming homogeneity) must now be calculated. Consider the first nonconformance category for the first production line. When the lines are homogeneous,

estimated expected number among the 150 selected units that are blemished

\[=\frac{\left(\text{first row total}\right)\left(\text{first column total}\right)}{\text{total of sample sizes}}=\frac{\left(150\right)\left(189\right)}{375}=35.60\]

The contribution of the cell in the upper-left corner to \(\chi^{2}\) is then

\[\frac{\left(\text{observed}-\text{ estimated expected}\right)^{2}}{\text{estimated expected}}=\frac{\left(34-35.60\right)^{2}}{35.60}=.072\]The other contributions are calculated in a similar manner. Figure 13.4 shows MINITAB output for the chi-squared test. The observed count is the top number in each cell, and directly below it is the estimated expected count. The contribution of each cell to \(\chi^{2}\) appears below the counts, and the test statistic value is \(\chi^{2}=14.159\). All estimated expected counts are at least 5, so combining categories is unnecessary. The test is based on \((3-1)(5-1)=8\) df. Appendix Table A.10 shows that the values that capture upper-tail areas of.08 and.075 under the 8 df curve are 14.06 and 14.26, respectively. Thus the \(P\)-value is between.075 and.08; MINITAB gives \(P\)-value \(=.079\). The null hypothesis of homogeneity should not be rejected at the usual significance levels of.05 or.01, but it would be rejected for the higher \(\alpha\) of.10.

### Testing for Independence

We focus now on the relationship between two different factors in a single population. The number of categories of the first factor will be denoted by \(I\) and the number of categories of the second factor by \(J\). Each individual in the population is assumed to belong in exactly one of the \(I\) categories associated with the first factor and exactly one of the \(J\) categories associated with the second factor. For example, the population of interest might consist of all individuals who regularly watch the national news on television, with the first factor being preferred network (ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, or FOX, so \(I=6\)) and the second factor political philosophy (liberal, moderate, conservative, giving \(J=3\)).

For a sample of \(n\) individuals taken from the population, let \(n_{ij}\) denote the number among the \(n\) who fall both in category \(i\) of the first factor and category \(j\) of the second factor. The \(n_{ij}\)'s can be displayed in a two-way contingency table with \(I\) rows and \(J\) columns. In the case of homogeneity for \(I\) populations, the row totals were fixed in advance, and only the \(J\) column totals were random. Now only the total sample size is fixed, and both the \(n_{i}\).'s and \(n_{j}\)'s are observed values of random variables. To state the hypotheses of interest, let

Figure 13.4: MINITAB output for the chi-squared test of Example 13.13

\[p_{ij} = \text{the proportion of individuals in the population who}\] \[\text{belong in category }i\text{ of factor }1\text{ and category }j\text{ of factor }2\] \[= P(\text{a randomly selected individual falls in both category}\text{ }i\text{ of factor }1\text{ and category }j\text{ of factor }2)\]

Then

\[p_{i:} = \sum_{j}p_{ij} = P(\text{a randomly selected individual falls in category }i\text{ of factor }1)\] \[p_{j} = \sum_{i}p_{ij} = P(\text{a randomly selected individual falls in category }j\text{ of factor }2)\]

Recall that two events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent if \(P(A\cap B)=P(A)\cdot P(B)\). _The null hypothesis here says that an individual's category with respect to factor \(1\) is independent of the category with respect to factor \(2\)._ In symbols, this becomes \(p_{ij}=p_{i:}\cdot p_{j:}\) for every pair \((i,j)\).

The expected count in cell \((i,j)\) is \(n\cdot p_{ij}\), so when \(H_{O}\) is true, \(E(N_{ij})=n\cdot p_{i:}\cdot p_{j:}\). To obtain a chi-squared statistic, we must therefore estimate the \(p_{i:}\)'s (\(i=1,\ldots,I\)) and \(p_{j}\)'s (\(j=1,\ldots,J\)). The (maximum likelihood) estimates are

\[\hat{p}_{i:}=\frac{n_{i:}}{n} = \text{ sample proportion for category }i\text{ of factor }1\]

and

\[\hat{p}_{j:}=\frac{n_{j}}{n} = \text{ sample proportion for category }j\text{ of factor }2\]

This gives estimated expected cell counts identical to those in the case of homogeneity.

\[\hat{e}_{ij} = n\cdot\hat{p}_{i:}\cdot\hat{p}_{j:}=n\cdot\frac{n_{i:}}{n} \cdot\frac{n_{j}}{n} = \frac{n_{i:}\cdot n_{j}}{n}\] \[= \frac{(i\text{th row total})(j\text{th column total})}{n}\]

The test statistic is also identical to that used in testing for homogeneity, as is the number of degrees of freedom. This is because the number of freely determined cell counts is \(IJ-1\), since only the total \(n\) is fixed in advance. There are \(I\) estimated \(p_{i:}\)'s, but only \(I-1\) are independently estimated since \(\Sigma\ p_{i:}=1\), and similarly \(J-1\)\(p_{j}\)'s are independently estimated, so \(I+J\) - two parameters are independently estimated. The rule of thumb now yields \(\text{df}=IJ-1-(I+J-2)=IJ-I+1=(I-1)\cdot(J-1)\).

\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{l}{Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}\colon p_{ij}=p_{i}\cdot p_{j}\quad i=1,\ldots,I;\quad j=1,\ldots,J\)} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{Alternative hypothesis: \(H_{\text{a}}:H_{0}\) is not true} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{Test statistic value:} \\ \(\chi^{2}=\sum_{\text{all cells}}\frac{\left(\text{observed}-\text{estimated expected}\right)^{2}}{\text{estimated expected}}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\frac{\left(n_{ij}-\hat{e}_{ij}\right)^{2}}{\hat{e}_{ij}}\) \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{Rejection region: \(\chi^{2}\geq\chi^{2}_{\alpha,(I-1)(J-1)}\)} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{Again, \(P\)-value information can be obtained as described in Section 13.1.} \\ \multicolumn{2}{l}{The test can safely be applied as long as \(\hat{e}_{ij}\geq 5\) for all cells.} \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

A study of the relationship between facility conditions at gasoline stations and aggressiveness in the pricing of gasoline ("An Analysis of Price Aggressiveness in Gasoline Marketing," _J. Market. Res._, 1970: 36-42) reports the accompanying data based on a sample of \(n=441\) stations. At level.01, does the data suggest that facility conditions and pricing policy are independent of one another? Observed and estimated expected counts are given in Table 13.10.

Thus

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{\left(24-17.02\right)^{2}}{17.02}+\cdots+\frac{\left(36-54.29 \right)^{2}}{54.29}=22.47\]

and because \(\chi^{2}_{\text{01},4}=13.277\), the hypothesis of independence is rejected.

We conclude that knowledge of a station's pricing policy does give information about the condition of facilities at the station. In particular, stations with an aggressive pricing policy appear more likely to have substandard facilities than stations with a neutral or nonaggressive policy. \(\blacksquare\)

### Ordinal Factors and Logistic Regression

Sometimes a factor has ordinal categories, meaning that there is a natural ordering. For example, there is a natural ordering to freshman, sophomore, junior, senior. In such situations we can use a method that often has greater power to detect relationships. Consider the case in which the first factor is ordinal and the other has two categories. Denote by \(X\) the level of the first (ordinal) factor, the rows, which will be the predictor in the model. Then \(Y\) designates the column, either one or two, and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline  & & \multicolumn{6}{c}{**Observed Pricing Policy**} \\  & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Aggressive**} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Neutral Nonaggressive**} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Expected Pricing Policy**} \\ \cline{3-10}  & **Substandard** & 24 & 15 & 17 & 56 & 17.02 & 22.10 & 16.89 & 56 \\ \cline{3-10}
**Condition** & **Standard** & 52 & 73 & 80 & 205 & 62.29 & 80.88 & 61.83 & 205 \\ \cline{3-10}  & **Modern** & 58 & 86 & 36 & 180 & 54.69 & 71.02 & 54.29 & 180 \\ \cline{3-10}  & \(n_{j}\) & 134 & 174 & 133 & 441 & 134 & 174 & 133 & 441 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.10: Observed and estimated expected counts for Example 13.14_Y_ will be the dependent variable in the model. It is convenient for purposes of logistic regression to label column 1 as \(Y\) = 0 (failure) and column 2 as \(Y\) = 1 (success), corresponding to the usual notation for binomial trials. In terms of logistic regression, _p_(_x_) is the probability of success given that \(X\) = _x_:

\[p(x) = P(Y = 1|X = x) = P(j = 2|i = x) = \frac{p_{x2}}{p_{x1} + p_{x2}}\]

Then the logistic model of Chapter 12 says that

\[e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x} = \frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)} = \frac{p_{x2}}{p_{x1}}\]

In terms of the odds of success in a row (estimated by the ratio of the two counts), the model says that the odds change proportionally (by the fixed multiple _e_b_1) from row to row. For example, suppose a test is given in grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 with successes and failures as follows

\[\begin{array}{l c c c} \hline \hline \text{{Grade}} & \text{{Failed}} & \text{{Passed}} & \text{{Estimated Odds}} \\ \hline 1 & 45 & 45 & 1 \\ 2 & 30 & 60 & 2 \\ 3 & 18 & 72 & 4 \\ 4 & 10 & 80 & 8 \\ \hline \hline\end{array}\]

Here the model fits perfectly, with odds ratio _e_b_1 = 2, so \(b\)1 = ln(2) and \(b\)0 = -ln(2). In general, it should be clear that \(b\)1 is the natural log of the odds ratio between successive rows. If a table with \(I\) rows and 2 columns has roughly a common odds ratio from row to row, then the logistic model should be a good fit if the rows are labeled with consecutive integers.

We focus on the slope \(b\)1 because the relationship between the two factors hinges on this parameter. The hypothesis of no relationship is equivalent to \(H\)0: \(b\)1 = 0, which is usually tested against a two-tailed alternative.

Is there a relationship between TV watching and physical fitness? For an answer we refer to the article "Television Viewing and Physical Fitness in Adults" (_Res. Quart. Exercise Sport_, 1990: 315-320). Subjects were asked about their television-viewing habits and were classified as physically fit if they scored in the excellent or very good category on a step test. Table 13.11 shows the results in the form of a 4 x 2 table. The TV column gives the hours per day

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline
**TV Time** & **Unit** & **Fit** \\
**0** & 147 & 35 \\ \cline{2-3}
**1–2** & 629 & 101 \\ \cline{2-3}
**3–4** & 222 & 28 \\ \cline{2-3}
**5+** & 34 & 4 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13.11: TV versus fitness resultsThe rows need to be given specific numeric values for computational purposes, and it is convenient to make these just 1, 2, 3, 4, because consecutive integers correspond to the assumption of a common odds ratio from row to row. The columns may need to be labeled as 0 and 1 for input to a program. The logistic regression results from MINITAB are shown in Figure 13.5, where the estimated coefficient \(\hat{\beta}_{1}\) for TV is given as -.29 and the odds ratio is given as \(.75\,=\,e^{-.29}\). This means that, for each increase in TV watching category, the odds of being fit decline to about 3/4 of the previous value. There is a loss of 25% for each increment in TV.

The output shows two tests for \(\beta_{1}\), a \(z\) based on the ratio of the coefficient to its estimated standard error and G, which is based on a likelihood ratio test and gives the chi-squared approximation for the difference of log likelihoods. The two tests usually give very similar results, with G being approximately the square of \(z\). In this case they agree that the \(P\)-value is around.02, which means that we should reject at the.05 level the hypothesis that \(\beta_{1}=0\), and we can conclude that there is a relationship between TV watching and fitness. Of course, the existence of a relationship does not imply anything about one causing the other. By the way, a chi-squared test yields \(\chi^{2}=6.161\) with 3 df, \(P=.104\), so with this test we would not conclude that there is a relationship, even at the 10% level. There is an advantage in using logistic regression for this kind of data.

Suppose there are two ordinal factors, each with more than two levels. This too can be handled with logistic regression, but it requires a procedure called ordinal logistic regression that allows an ordinal dependent variable. When one factor is ordinal and the other is not, the analysis can be done with multinomial (also called nominal or polytomous) logistic regression, which allows a non-ordinal dependent variable.

Models and methods for analyzing data in which each individual is categorized with respect to three or more factors (multidimensional contingency tables) are discussed in several of the references in the chapter bibliography.

**29.**: Each individual in a random sample of high school and college students was cross-classified with respect to both political views and marijuana usage, resulting in the data displayed in the accompanying two-way table ("Attitudes About Marijuana and Political Views," _Psych. Rep._, 1973: 1,051-1,054). Does the data support the hypothesis that political views and marijuana usage level are independent within the population? Test the appropriate hypotheses using level of significance.01.
**30.**: Show that the chi-squared statistic for the test of independence can be written in the form

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left(\frac{N_{ij}^{2}}{\hat{E}_{ij}} \right)-n\]

Why is this formula more efficient computationally than the defining formula for \(\chi^{2}\)?
**31.**: Suppose that in Exercise 29 each student had been categorized with respect to political views, marijuana usage, and religious preference, with the categories of this latter factor being Protestant, Catholic, and other. The data could be displayed in three different two-way tables, one corresponding to each category of the third factor. With \(p_{ijk}=P\)(political category \(i\), marijuana category \(j\), and religious category \(k\)), the null hypothesis of independence of all three factors states that \(p_{ijk}=p_{i\text{-}}\). \(p_{j\text{-}}\). \(p_{\text{-}k}\) Let \(n_{ijk}\) denote the observed frequency in cell (\(i,j,k\)). Show how to estimate the expected cell counts assuming that \(H_{0}\) is true (\(\hat{e}_{ijk}=n\hat{p}_{ijk}\), so the \(\hat{p}_{ijk}\)'s must be determined). Then use the general rule of thumb to determine the number of degrees of freedom for the chi-squared statistic.
**32.**: Suppose that in a particular state consisting of four distinct regions, a random sample of \(n_{k}\) voters is obtained from the \(k\)th region for \(k=1\), 2, 3, 4. Each voter is then classified according to which candidate (1, 2, or 3) he or she prefers and according to voter registration (\(1=\text{Dem.}\), \(2=\text{Rep.}\), \(3=\text{Indep.}\)). Let \(p_{ijk}\) denote the proportion of voters in region \(k\) who belong in candidate category \(i\) and registration category \(j\). The null hypothesis of homogeneous regions is \(H_{0}\): \(p_{ij1}=p_{ij2}=p_{ij3}=p_{ij4}\) for all \(i,j\) (i.e., the proportion within each candidate/registration combination is the same for all four regions). Assuming that \(H_{0}\) is true, determine \(\hat{p}_{ijk}\) and \(\hat{e}_{ijk}\) as functions of the observed \(n_{ijk}\)'s, and use the general rule of thumb to obtain the number of degrees of freedom for the chi-squared test.
**33.**: Consider the accompanying \(2\,\times\,3\) table displaying the sample proportions that fell in the various combinations of categories (e.g., 13% of those in the sample were in the first category of both factors).
**a.**: Suppose the sample consisted of \(n=100\) people. Use the chi-squared test for independence with significance level.10.
**b.**: Repeat part (a) assuming that the sample size was \(n=1000\).
**c.**: What is the smallest sample size \(n\) for which these observed proportions would result in rejection of the independence hypothesis?
**34.**: Use logistic regression to test the relationship between leaf removal and fruit growth in Exercise 25. Compare the \(P\)-value with what was found in Exercise 25. (Remember that \(\chi^{2}_{1}=z^{2}\).) Explain why you expected the logistic regression to give a smaller \(P\)-value.
**35.**: A random sample of 100 faculty at a university gives the results shown below for professorial rank versus gender.
**a.**: Test for a relationship at the 5% level using a chi-squared statistic.
**b.**: Test for a relationship at the 5% level using logistic regression.

* Compare the _P_-values in parts (a) and (b). Is this in accord with your expectations? Explain. **d**. Interpret your results. Assuming that today's assistant professors are tomorrow's associate professors and professors, do you see implications for the future?

## Supplementary Exercises

* The article "Birth Order and Political Success" (_Psych. Rep._, 1971: 1,239-1,242) reports that among 31 randomly selected candidates for political office who came from families with four children, 12 were firstborn, 11 were middleborn, and 8 were lastborn. Use this data to test the null hypothesis that a political candidate from such a family is equally likely to be in any one of the four ordinal positions.
* The results of an experiment to assess the effect of crude oil on fish parasites are described in the article "Effects of Crude Oils on the Gastrointestinal Parasites of Two Species of Marine Fish" (_J. Wildlife Diseases_, 1983: 253-258). Three treatments (corresponding to populations in the procedure described) were compared: (1) no contamination, (2) contamination by 1-year-old weathered oil, and (3) contamination by new oil. For each treatment condition, a sample of fish was taken, and then each fish was classified as either parasitized or not parasitized. Data compatible with that in the article is given. Does the data indicate that the three treatments differ with respect to the true proportion of parasitized and nonparasitized fish? Test using \(\alpha=.01\).
* Qualifications of male and female head and assistant college athletic coaches were compared in the article "Sex Bias and the Validity of Believed Differences Between Male and Female Interscholastic Athletic Coaches" (_Res. Q. Exercise Sport_, 1990: 259-267). Each person in random samples of 2225 male coaches and 1141 female coaches was classified according to number of years of coaching experience to obtain the accompanying two-way table. Is there enough evidence to conclude that the proportions falling into the experience categories are different for men and women? Use \(\alpha=.01\).
* The authors of the article "Predicting Professional Sports Game Outcomes from Intermediate Game Scores" (_Chance_, 1992: 18-22) used a chi-squared test to determine whether there was any merit to the idea that basketball games are not settled until the last quarter, whereas baseball games are over by the seventh inning. They also considered football and hockey. Data was collected for 189 basketball games, 92 baseball games, 80 hockey games, and 93 football games. The games analyzed were sampled randomly from all games played during the 1990 season for baseball and football and for the 1990-1991 season for basketball and hockey. For each game, the late-game leader was determined, and then it was noted whether the late-game leader actually ended up winning the game. The resulting data is summarized in the accompanying table.

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline  & **Late-Game** & **Late-Game** \\
**Sport** & **Leader Wins** & **Leader Losses** \\ \hline Basketball & 150 & 39 \\ Baseball & 86 & 6 \\ Hockey & 65 & 15 \\ Football & 72 & 21 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} The authors state, "_Late-game leader_ is defined as the team that is ahead after three quarters in basketball and football, two periods in hockey, and seven innings in baseball. The chi-squarevalue on three degrees of freedom is 10.52 (_P_ <.015)." * State the relevant hypotheses and reach a conclusion using \(a\) =.05. * Do you think that your conclusion in part (a) can be attributed to a single sport being an anomaly?
40. The accompanying two-way frequency table appears in the article "Marijuana Use in College" (_Youth and Society_, 1979: 323-334). Each of 445 college students was classified according to both frequency of marijuana use and parental use of alcohol and psychoactive drugs. Does the data suggest that parental usage and student usage are independent in the population from which the sample was drawn? Use the _P_-value method to reach a conclusion. 

41. In a study of 2989 cancer deaths, the location of death (home, acute-care hospital, or chronic-care facility) and age at death were recorded, resulting in the given two-way frequency table ("Where Cancer Patients Die," _Public Health Rep._, 1983: 173). Using a.01 significance level, test the null hypothesis that age at death and location of death are independent. 

42. In a study to investigate the extent to which individuals are aware of industrial odors in a certain region ("Annoyance and Health Reactions to Odor from Refineries and Other Industries in Carson, California," _Environ. Res._, 1978: 119-132), a sample of individuals was obtained from each of three different areas near industrial facilities. Each individual was asked whether he or she noticed odors (1) every day, (2) at least once/week, (3) at least once/month, (4) less often than once/month, or (5) not at all, resulting in the output from SPSS on the next page. State and test the appropriate hypotheses. 

43. Many shoppers have expressed unhappiness because grocery stores have stopped putting prices on individual grocery items. The article "The Impact of Item Price Removal on Grocery Shopping Behavior" (_J. Market._, 1980: 73-93) reports on a study in which each shopper in a sample was classified by age and by whether he or she felt the need for item pricing. Based on the accompanying data, does the need for item pricing appear to be independent of age?

44. Let \(p\)1 denote the proportion of successes in a particular population. The test statistic value in Chapter 9 for testing \(H\)0: \(p\)1 = \(p\)10 was \(z = (\hat{p}_{1} - p_{10} )/\sqrt {p_{10} p_{20} /n}\), where \(p_{20} = 1 - p_{10}\). Show that for the case \(k\) = 2, the chi-squared statistic value of Section 13.1 satisfies \(\chi^{2} = z^{2}\). [_Hint_: First show that \((n_{1} - np_{10} )^{2} = (n_{2} - np_{20} )^{2}\).]
45. The NCAA basketball tournament begins with 64 teams that are apportioned into four regional tournaments, each involving 16 teams. The 16 teams in each region are then ranked (seeded) from 1 to 16. During the 12-year period from 1991 to 2002, the top-ranked team won its regional tournament 22 times, the second-ranked team won 10 times, the third-ranked team won 5 times, and the remaining 11 regional tournaments were won by teams ranked lower than 3. Let \(P_{j}\) denote the probability that the team ranked \(i\) in its region is victorious in its game against the team ranked \(j\). Once the _P__ij_'s are available, it is possible to compute the probability that any particular seed wins its regional tournament (a complicated calculation because the number of outcomesin the sample space is quite large). The paper "Probability Models for the NCAA Regional Basketball Tournaments"(_Amer. Statist._, 1991: 35-38) proposed several different models for the _P__ij_'s.

- _j_) with \(l\) = \(\frac{1}{32}\) (from which \(P_{16,1} = \frac{1}{32}\), \(P_{16,2} = \frac{2}{32}\), etc.). Based on this, _P_(seed #1 wins) =.27477, _P_(seed #2 wins) =.20834, and _P_(seed #3 wins) =.15429. Does this model appear to provide a good fit to the data?
* _zj_), where the _z_'s are measures of relative strengths related to standard normal percentiles [percentiles for successive highly seeded teams are closer together than is the case for teams seeded lower, and.2813625 ensures that the range of probabilities is the same as for the model in part (a)]. The resulting probabilities of seeds 1, 2, or 3 winning their regional tournaments are.45883,.18813, and.11032, respectively. Assess the fit of this model.
* Have you ever wondered whether soccer players suffer adverse effects from hitting "headers"? The authors of the article "No Evidence of Impaired Neurocognitive Performance in Collegiate Soccer Players" (_Amer. J. Sports Med._ 2002: 157-162) investigated this issue from several perspectives.
* The paper reported that 45 of the 91 soccer players in their sample had suffered at least one concussion, 28 of 96 nonsoccer athletes had suffered at least one concussion, and only 8 of 53 student controls had suffered at least one concussion. Analyze this data and draw appropriate conclusions.
* For the soccer players, the sample correlation coefficient calculated from the values of \(x\) = soccer exposure (total number of competitive seasons played prior to enrollment in the study) and \(y\) = score on an immediate memory recall test was \(r\) = -.220. Interpret this result.
* Here is summary information on scores on a controlled oral word-association test for the soccer and nonsoccer athletes: \[n_{1} = 26,\bar{x_{1}} = 37.50,s_{1} = 9.13,\] \[n_{2} = 56,\bar{x_{2}} = 39.63,s_{2} = 10.19\] Analyze this data and draw appropriate conclusions.

**d.** Considering the number of prior nonsoccer concussions, the values of mean \(\pm\) SD for the three groups were soccer players,.30 \(\pm\).67; nonsoccer athletes,.49 \(\pm\).87; and student controls,.19 \(\pm\).48. Analyze this data and draw appropriate conclusions.

Do the successive digits in the decimal expansion of \(\pi\) behave as though they were selected from a random number table (or came from a computer's random number generator)? **a.** Let \(p_{0}\) denote the long-run proportion of digits in the expansion that equal 0, and define \(p_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(p_{9}\) analogously. What hypotheses about these proportions should be tested, and what is df for the chi-squared test? **b.**\(H_{0}\) of part (a) would not be rejected for the nonrandom sequence 012 \(\ldots\) 901 \(\ldots\) 901 \(\ldots\)

## Chapter 4 Alternative Approaches to Inference

### 4.1 Introduction

In this final chapter we consider some inferential methods that are different in important ways from those considered earlier. Recall that many of the confidence intervals and test procedures developed in Chapters 9-12 were based on some sort of a normality assumption. As long as such an assumption is at least approximately satisfied, the actual confidence and significance levels will be at least approximately equal to the "nominal" levels, those prescribed by the experimenter through the choice of particular \(t\) or \(F\) critical values. However, if there is a substantial violation of the normality assumption, the actual levels may differ considerably from the nominal levels (e.g., the use of \(t\)025 in a confidence interval formula may actually result in a confidence level of only 88% rather than the nominal 95%). In the first three sections of this chapter, we develop _distribution-free_ or _non-parametric_ procedures that are valid for a wide variety of underlying distributions rather than being tied to normality. We have actually already introduced several such methods: the bootstrap intervals and permutation tests are valid without restrictive assumptions on the underlying distribution(s).

Section 14.4 introduces the Bayesian approach to inference. The standard _frequentist_ view of inference is that the parameter of interest, _th_, has a fixed but unknown value. Bayesians, however, regard _th_ as a random variable having a _prior_ probability distribution that incorporates whatever is known about its value. Then to learn more about _th_, a sample from the _conditional_ distribution _f_(_x_|_th_) is obtained, and Bayes' theorem is used to produce the _posterior_ distribution of _th_ given the data \(x\)1,..., _x_m. All Bayesian methods are based on this posterior distribution.

The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

A research chemist replicated a particular experiment a total of 10 times and obtained the following values of reaction temperature, ordered from smallest to largest:

\[-.57\quad-.19\quad-.05\quad.76\quad 1.30\quad 2.02\quad 2.17\quad 2.46\quad 2.68\quad 3.02\]

The distribution of reaction temperature is of course continuous. Suppose the investigator is willing to assume that this distribution is symmetric, so that the pdf satisfies \(f(\widetilde{\mu}+t)=f(\widetilde{\mu}-t)\) for any \(t>\)0, where \(\widetilde{\mu}\) is the median of the distribution (and also the mean \(\mu\) provided that the mean exists). This condition on \(f(x)\) simply says that the height of the density curve above a value any particular distance to the right of the median is the same as the height that same distance to the left of the median. The assumption of symmetry may at first thought seem quite bold, but remember that we have frequently assumed a normal distribution. Since a normal distribution is symmetric, the assumption of symmetry without any additional distributional specification is actually a weaker assumption than normality.

Let's now consider testing the null hypothesis that \(\widetilde{\mu}=0\). This amounts to saying that a temperature of any particular magnitude, say 1.50, is no more likely to be positive (+1.50) than to be negative (\(-1.50\)). A glance at the data casts doubt on this hypothesis; for example, the sample median is 1.66, which is far larger in magnitude than any of the three negative observations.

Figure 14.1 shows graphs of two symmetric pdf's, one for which \(H_{0}\) is true and the other for which the median of the distribution considerably exceeds 0. In the first case we expect the magnitudes of the negative observations in the sample to be comparable to those of the positive sample observations. However, in the second case observations of large absolute magnitude will tend to be positive rather than negative.

For the sample of ten reaction temperatures, let's for the moment disregard the signs of the observations and rank the absolute magnitudes from 1 to 10, with the smallest getting rank 1, the second smallest rank 2, and so on. Then apply the sign of each observation to the corresponding rank (so some signed ranks will be negative, e.g. \(-3\), whereas others will be positive, e.g. 8). The test statistic will be \(S_{+}=\) the sum of the positively signed ranks.

\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Absolute Magnitude** &.05 &.19 &.57 &.76 & 1.30 & 2.02 & 2.17 & 2.46 & 2.68 & 3.02 \\ \hline
**Rank** & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ \hline
**Signed Rank** & \(-1\) & \(-2\) & \(-3\) & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

\[s_{+}=4+5+6+7+8+9+10=49\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12033]

is symmetric about 7.5 [more generally, symmetrically distributed over the possible values 0, 1, 2,..., \(n(n+1)/2\)]. This symmetry is important in relating the rejection region of lower-tailed and two-tailed tests to that of an upper-tailed test.

For \(n=10\) there are \(2^{10}=1024\) possible signed rank sequences, so a listing would involve much effort. Each sequence, though, would have probability 1/1024 when \(H_{0}\) is true, from which the distribution of \(S_{+}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true can be easily obtained.

We are now in a position to determine a rejection region for testing \(H_{0}\): \(\widetilde{\mu}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\widetilde{\mu}>0\) that has a suitably small significance level \(\alpha\). Consider the rejection region \(R=\{s_{+}:s_{+}\geq 13\}=\{13,14,15\}\). Then

\[\alpha =P(\text{reject }H_{0}\text{ when }H_{0}\text{ is true})\] \[=P(S_{+}=13,14,\text{ or }15\text{ when }H_{0}\text{ is true})\] \[=1/32+1/32+1/32=3/32\] \[=.094\]

so that \(R=\{13,14,15\}\) specifies a test with approximate level.1. For the rejection region \(\{14,\ 15\}\), \(\alpha=2/32=.063\). For the sample \(x_{1}=.58,\ x_{2}=2.50,\ x_{3}=-.21,\ x_{4}=1.23,\ x_{5}=.97\), the signed rank sequence is \(-1\), +2, +3, +4, +5, so \(s_{+}=14\) and at level.063 \(H_{0}\) would be rejected.

### A General Description of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

Because the underlying distribution is assumed symmetric, \(\mu=\widetilde{\mu}\), so we will state the hypotheses of interest in terms of \(\mu\) rather than \(\widetilde{\mu}\).1

Footnote 1: If the tails of the distribution are “too heavy,” as was the case with the Cauchy distribution of Chapter 7, then \(\mu\) will not exist. In such cases, the Wilcoxon test will still be valid for tests concerning \(\widetilde{\mu}\).

\[\text{ASSUMPTION}\]

\[X_{1},\ X_{2},\ \ldots,\ X_{n}\text{ is a random sample from a continuous and symmetric probability distribution with mean (and median) }\mu\]

When the hypothesized value of \(\mu\) is \(\mu_{0}\), the absolute differences \(|x_{1}-\mu_{0}|,...|x_{n}-\mu_{0}|\), must be ranked from smallest to largest.

\[\text{Null hypothesis: }H_{0}\text{: }\mu=\mu_{0}\]

Test statistic value: \(s_{+}=\text{the sum of the ranks associated with positive }(x_{i}-\mu_{0})\)'s

**Alternative Hypothesis** **Rejection Region for Level \(\alpha\) Test**

\[H_{\text{a}}\text{: }\mu>\mu_{0}\] \[H_{\text{a}}\text{: }\mu<\mu_{0}\] \[H_{\text{a}}\text{: }\mu\neq\mu_{0}\] either \[s_{+}\geq c\text{ or }s_{+}\leq n(n+1)/2-c\]

where the critical values \(c_{1}\) and \(c\) obtained from Appendix Table A.12 satisfy \(P(S_{+}\geq c_{1})\approx\alpha\) and \(P(S_{+}\geq c)\approx\alpha/2\) when \(H_{0}\) is true.

A producer of breakfast cereals wants to verify that a filler machine is operating correctly. The machine is supposed to fill one-pound boxes with 460 g, on the average. This is a little above the 453.6 g needed for one pound. When the contents are weighed, it is found that 15 boxes yield the following measurements:

\[\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}454.4&470.8&447.5&453.2&462.6&445.0&455.9&458.2 \\ 461.6&457.3&452.0&464.3&459.2&453.5&465.8&\end{array}\]

It is believed that deviations of any magnitude from 460 g are just as likely to be positive as negative (in accord with the symmetry assumption) but the distribution may not be normal. Therefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to see if the filler machine is calibrated correctly.

The hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=460\) versus \(H_{a}\): \(\mu\neq 460\), where \(\mu\) is the true average weight. Subtracting 460 from each measurement gives

\[\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}-5.6&10.8&-12.5&-6.8&2.6&-15.0&-4.1&-1.8&1.6& -2.7\\ -8.0&4.3&-.8&-6.5&5.8&\end{array}\]

The ranks are obtained by ordering these from smallest to largest without regard to sign.

\[\begin{array}{l|cccccccccccccccc}\hline\hline\textbf{Absolute}\\ \textbf{Magnitude}&.8&1.6&1.8&2.6&2.7&4.1&4.3&5.6&5.8&6.5&6.8&8.0&10.8&12.5&15.0 \\ \hline\textbf{Rank}&1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12&13&14&15\\ \hline\textbf{Sign}&-&+&-&+&-&-&+&-&+&-&-&-&+&-&-\\ \hline\end{array}\]

Thus \(s_{+}=2+4+7+9+13=35\). From Appendix Table 12, \(P(S_{+}\geq 95)=P(S_{+}\leq 25)=.024\) when \(H_{0}\) is true, so the two-tailed test with approximate level.05 rejects \(H_{0}\) when either \(s_{+}\geq 95\) or \(\leq 25\) [the exact \(\alpha\) is \(2(.024)=.048\)]. Since \(s_{+}=35\) is not in the rejection region, it cannot be concluded at level.05 that \(\mu\) differs from 460. Even at level.094 (approximately.1), \(H_{0}\) cannot be rejected, since \(P(S_{+}\leq 30)=P(S_{+}\geq 90)=.047\) implies that \(s_{+}\) values between 30 and 90 are not significant at that level. The \(P\)-value of the data is thus \(>\).1. \(\blacksquare\)

Although a theoretical implication of the continuity of the underlying distribution is that ties will not occur, in practice they often do because of the discreteness of measuring instruments. If there are several data values with the same absolute magnitude, then they would be assigned the average of the ranks they would receive if they differed very slightly from one another. For example, if in Example 14.1\(x_{8}=458.2\) is changed to 458.4, then two different values of (\(x_{i}-460\)) would have absolute magnitude 1.6. The ranks to be averaged would be 2 and 3, so each would be assigned rank 2.5.

### Paired Observations

When the data consisted of pairs \((X_{1},Y_{1}),\ldots,(X_{n},Y_{n})\) and the differences \(D_{1}=X_{1}-Y_{1},\ldots,D_{n}=X_{n}-Y_{n}\) were normally distributed, in Chapter 10 we used a paired \(t\) test for hypotheses about the expected difference \(\mu_{D}\). If normality is not assumed, hypotheses about \(\mu_{D}\) can be tested by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the \(D_{i}\)'s provided that the distribution of the differences is continuous and symmetric. _If \(X_{i}\) and \(Y_{i}\) both have continuous distributions that differ only with respect to their means_ (so the \(Y\) distribution is the \(X\) distribution shifted by \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\mu_{D}\)), _then \(D_{i}\) will have a continuous symmetric distribution_ (it is _not_ necessary for the \(X\) and \(Y\) distributions to be symmetric individually). The null hypothesis is \(H_{0}:\mu_{D}=\Delta_{0}\), and the test statistic \(S_{+}\) is the sum of the ranks associated with the positive (\(D_{i}\)\(-\)\(\Delta_{0}\))'s.

About 100 years ago an experiment was done to see if drugs could help people with severe insomnia ("The Action of Optical Isomers, II: Hyosciines,"\(J\). _Physiol._, 1905: 501-510). There were 10 patients who had trouble sleeping, and each patient tried several medications. Here we compare just the control (no medication) and levo-hyoscine. Does the drug offer an improvement in average sleep time? The relevant hypotheses are \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{D}=0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{D}<0\). Here are the sleep times, differences, and signed ranks.

Notice that there is a tie for the lowest rank, so the two lowest ranks are split between observations 9 and 10, and each receives rank 1.5. Appendix Table 12 shows that for a test with significance level approximately.05, the null hypothesis should be rejected if \(s_{+}\leq(10)(11)/2-44=11\). The test statistic value is 1.5, which falls in the rejection region. We therefore reject \(H_{0}\) at significance level.05 in favor of the conclusion that the drug gives greater mean sleep time. The accompanying MINITAB output shows the test statistic value and also the corresponding \(P\)-value, which is \(P(S_{+}\leq\)1.5 when \(H_{0}\) is true).

### Efficiency of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test

When the underlying distribution being sampled is normal, either the \(t\) test or the signed-rank test can be used to test a hypothesis about \(\mu\). The \(t\) test is the best test in such a situation because among all level \(\alpha\) tests it is the one having minimum \(\beta\). It is generally agreed that there are many experimental situations in which normality can be reasonably assumed, as well as some in which it should not be. These two questions must be addressed in an attempt to compare the tests:

1. When the underlying distribution is normal (the "home ground" of the \(t\) test), how much is lost by using the signed-rank test?
2. When the underlying distribution is not normal, can a significant improvement be achieved by using the signed-rank test?

If the Wilcoxon test does not suffer much with respect to the \(t\) test on the "home ground" of the latter, and performs significantly better than the \(t\) test for a large number of other distributions, then there will be a strong case for using the Wilcoxon test.

Unfortunately, there are no simple answers to the two questions. Upon reflection, it is not surprising that the \(t\) test can perform poorly when the underlying distribution has "heavy tails" (i.e., when observed values lying far from \(\mu\) are relatively more likely than they are when the distribution is normal). This is because the behavior of the \(t\) test depends on the sample mean and variance, which are both unstable in the presence of heavy tails. The difficulty in producing answers to the two questions is that \(\beta\) for the Wilcoxon test is very difficult to obtain and study for _any_ underlying distribution, and the same can be said for the \(t\) test when the distribution is not normal. Even if \(\beta\) were easily obtained, any measure of efficiency would clearly depend on which underlying distribution was assumed. A number of different efficiency measures have been proposed by statisticians; one that many statisticians regard as credible is called **asymptotic relative efficiency** (ARE). The ARE of one test with respect to another is essentially the limiting ratio of sample sizes necessary to obtain identical error probabilities for the two tests. Thus if the ARE of one test with respect to a second equals.5, then when sample sizes are large, twice as large a sample size will be required of the first test to perform as well as the second test. Although the ARE does not characterize test performance for small sample sizes, the following results can be shown to hold:

1. When the underlying distribution is normal, the ARE of the Wilcoxon test with respect to the \(t\) test is approximately.95.
2. For any distribution, the ARE will be at least.86 and for many distributions will be much greater than 1. We can summarize these results by saying that, in large-sample problems, the Wilcoxon test is never very much less efficient than the \(t\) test and may be much more efficient if the underlying distribution is far from normal. Although the issue is far from resolved in the case of sample sizes obtained in most practical problems, studies have shown that the Wilcoxon test performs reasonably and is thus a viable alternative to the \(t\) test.

1. Reconsider the situation described in Exercise 32 of Section 9.2, and use the Wilcoxon test with \(\alpha=.05\) to test the relevant hypotheses.
2. Use the Wilcoxon test to analyze the data given in Example 9.9.
3. The accompanying data is a subset of the data reported in the article "Synovial Fluid pH, Lactate, Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Partial Pressure in Various Joint Diseases" (_Arthritis Rheum._, 1971: 476-477). The observations are pH values of synovial fluid (which lubricates joints and tendons) taken from the knees of individuals suffering from arthritis. Assuming that true average pH for non-arthritic individuals is 7.39, test at level.05 to see whether the data indicates a difference between average pH values for arthritic and nonarthritic individuals.
4. A random sample of 15 automobile mechanics certified to work on a certain type of car was selected, and the time (in minutes) necessary for each one to diagnose a particular problem was determined, resulting in the following data: 30.6 30.1 15.6 26.7 27.1 25.4 35.0 30.8 31.9 53.2 12.5 23.2 8.8 24.9 30.2

Use the Wilcoxon test at significance level.10 to decide whether the data suggests that true average diagnostic time is less than 30 minutes.
5. Both a gravimetric and a spectrophotometric method are under consideration for determining phosphate content of a particular material. Twelve samples of the material are obtained, each is split in half, and a determination is made on each half using one of the two methods, resulting in the following data:

\[\begin{array}{l|rrrrr}\mathbf{Sample}&1&2&3&4\\ \hline\mathbf{Gravimetric}&54.7&58.5&66.8&46.1\\ \hline\mathbf{Spectrophotometric}&55.0&55.7&62.9&45.5\\ \mathbf{Sample}&5&6&7&8\\ \hline\mathbf{Gravimetric}&52.3&74.3&92.5&40.2\\ \hline\mathbf{Spectrophotometric}&51.1&75.4&89.6&38.4\\ \mathbf{Sample}&9&10&11&12\\ \hline\mathbf{Gravimetric}&87.3&74.8&63.2&68.5\\ \hline\mathbf{Spectrophotometric}&86.8&72.5&62.3&66.0\\ \end{array}\]

Use the Wilcoxon test to decide whether one technique gives on average a different value than the other technique for this type of material.
6. The signed-rank statistic can be represented as \(S_{+}=W_{1}+W_{2}+\cdots+W_{n}\), where \(W_{i}=i\) if the sign of the \(x_{i}-\mu_{0}\) with the \(i\)th largest absolute magnitude is positive (in which case \(i\) is included in \(S_{+}\)) and \(W_{i}=0\) if this value is negative (\(i=1,2\), 3,..., \(n\)). Furthermore, when \(H_{0}\) is true, the \(W_{i}\)'s are independent and \(P(W=i)=P(W=0)=.5\). * Use these facts to obtain the mean and variance of \(S_{+}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true. [_Hint_: The sum of the first \(n\) positive integers is \(n(n+1)/2\), and the sum of the squares of the first \(n\) positive integers is \(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6\).] * The \(W_{i}\)'s are not identically distributed (e.g., possible values of \(W_{2}\) are 2 and 0 whereas possible values of \(W_{5}\) are 5 and 0), so our Central Limit Theorem for identically distributed and independent variables cannot be used here when \(n\) is large. However, a more general CLT can be used to assert that when \(H_{0}\) is true and \(n>20\), \(S_{+}\) has approximately a normal distribution with mean and variance obtained in (a). Use this to propose a large-sample standardized signed-rank test statistic and then an appropriate rejection region with level \(\alpha\) for each of the three commonly encountered alternative hypotheses. [_Note_: When there are ties in the absolute magnitudes, it is still correct to standardize \(S_{+}\) by subtracting the mean from (a), but there is a correction for the variance which can be found in books on nonparametric statistics.] * A particular type of steel beam has been designed to have a compressive strength (lb/in\({}^{2}\)) of at least 50,000. An experimenter obtained a random sample of 25 beams and determined the strength of each one, resulting in the following data (expressed as deviations from 50,000): \[\begin{array}{ccccccc}-10&-27&36&-55&73&-77&-81\\ 90&-95&-99&113&-127&-129&136\\ -150&-155&-159&165&-178&-183&-192\\ -199&-212&-217&-229&\end{array}\]

Carry out a test using a significance level of approximately.01 to see if there is strong evidence that the design condition has been violated.
7. The accompanying 25 observations on fracture toughness of base plate of 18% nickel managing steel were reported in the article "Fracture Testing of Weldments" (_ASTM Special Publ. No. 381_, 1965: 328-356). Suppose a company will agree to purchase this steel for a particular application only if it can be strongly demonstrated from experimental evidence that true average toughness exceeds 75. Assuming that the fracture toughness distribution is symmetric, state and test the appropriate hypotheses at level.05, and compute a \(P\)-value. [_Hint_: Use Exercise 6(b).] \[69.5\ 71.9\ 72.6\ 73.1\ 73.3\ 73.5\ 74.1\ 74.2\ 75.3\] \[75.5\ 75.7\ 75.8\ 76.1\ 76.2\ 76.2\ 76.9\ 77.0\ 77.9\] \[78.1\ 79.6\ 79.7\ 80.1\ 82.2\ 83.7\ 93.7\]
8. Suppose that observations \(X_{1}\), \(X_{2}\),..., \(X_{n}\) are made on a process at times 1, 2,..., \(n\). On the basis of this data, we wish to test \[H_{0}\text{: the }X_{i}\text{'s constitute an independent and identically distributed sequence}\] versus \[H_{a}\text{: }X_{i+1}\text{ tends to be larger than }X_{i}\text{ for }i=1,\ldots,n\text{ (an increasing trend)}\] Suppose the \(X_{i}\text{'s are ranked from 1 to }n\). Then when \(H_{a}\) is true, larger ranks tend to occur later in the sequence, whereas if \(H_{0}\) is true, large and small ranks tend to be mixed together. Let \(R_{i}\) be the rank of \(X_{i}\) and consider the test statistic \(D=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(R_{i}-i\right)^{2}\).

Then small values of \(D\) give support to \(H_{\rm a}\) (e.g., the smallest value is 0 for \(R_{1}=1,\ R_{2}=2,...,R_{n}=n\)), so \(H_{0}\) should be rejected in favor of \(H_{\rm a}\) if \(d\leq c\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, any sequence of ranks has probability 1/\(n!\). Use this to find \(c\) for which the test has a level as close to.10 as possible in the case \(n=4\). [_Hint_: List the 4! rank sequences, compute \(d\) for each one, and then obtain the null distribution of \(D\). See the Lehmann book (in the chapter bibliography), for more information.]

### 1.2 The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test

When at least one of the sample sizes in a two-sample problem is small, the \(t\) test requires the assumption of normality (at least approximately). There are situations, though, in which an investigator would want to use a test that is valid even if the underlying distributions are quite nonnormal. We now describe such a test, called the **Wilcoxon rank-sum test**. An alternative name for the procedure is the Mann-Whitney test, although the Mann-Whitney test statistic is sometimes expressed in a slightly different form from that of the Wilcoxon test. The Wilcoxon test procedure is distribution-free because it will have the desired level of significance for a very large class of underlying distributions.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline Assumptions & \(X_{1}\),..., \(X_{m}\) and \(Y_{1}\),..., \(Y_{n}\) are two independent random samples from continuous distributions with means \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\), respectively. The \(X\) and \(Y\) distributions have the same shape and spread, the only possible difference between the two being in the values of \(\mu_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\). \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

When \(H_{0}\) : \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) is true, the \(X\) distribution is shifted by the amount \(\Delta_{0}\) to the right of the \(Y\) distribution; whereas when \(H_{0}\) is false, the shift is by an amount other than \(\Delta_{0}\).

### 1.3 Development of the Test When \(m=3\), \(n=4\)

Let's first test \(H_{0}\) : \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\). If \(\mu_{1}\) is actually much larger than \(\mu_{2}\), then most of the observed \(x\)'s will fall to the right of the observed \(y\)'s. However, if \(H_{0}\) is true, then the observed values from the two samples should be intermingled. The test statistic will provide a quantification of how much intermingling there is in the two samples.

Consider the case \(m=3\), \(n=4\). Then if all three observed \(x\)'s were to the right of all four observed \(y\)'s, this would provide strong evidence for rejecting \(H_{0}\) in favor of \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq 0\), with a similar conclusion being appropriate if all three \(x\)'s fall below all four of the \(y\)'s. Suppose we pool the \(x\)'s and \(y\)'s into a combined sample of size \(m+n=7\) and rank these observations from smallest to largest, with the smallest receiving rank 1 and the largest, rank 7. If either most of the largest ranks or most of the smallest ranks were associated with \(X\) observations, we would begin to doubt \(H_{0}\). This suggests the test statistic

\[\begin{array}{l}W=\mbox{the sum of the ranks in the combined sample}\\ \mbox{associated with}\,X\,\mbox{observations}\end{array} \tag{1.1}\]

For the values of \(m\) and \(n\) under consideration, the smallest possible value of \(W\) is \(w=1+2+3=6\) (if all three \(x\)'s are smaller than all four \(y\)'s), and the largest possible value is \(w=5+6+7=18\) (if all three \(x\)'s are larger than all four \(y\)'s).

As an example, suppose \(x_{1}=-3.10\), \(x_{2}=1.67\), \(x_{3}=2.01\), \(y_{1}=5.27\), \(y_{2}=1.89\), \(y_{3}=3.86\), and \(y_{4}=.19\). Then the pooled ordered sample is \(-3.10\), \(.19\), \(1.67\), \(1.89\), \(2.01\), \(3.86\), and \(5.27\). The \(X\) ranks for this sample are \(1\) (for \(-3.10\)), \(3\) (for \(1.67\)), and \(5\) (for \(2.01\)), so the computed value of \(W\) is \(w=1+3+5=9\).

The test procedure based on the statistic (14.1) is to reject \(H_{0}\) if the computed value \(w\) is "too extreme" -- that is, \(\geq c\) for an upper-tailed test, \(\leq c\) for a lower-tailed test, and either \(\geq c_{1}\) or \(\leq c_{2}\) for a two-tailed test. The critical constant(s) \(c\) (\(c_{1}\), \(c_{2}\)) should be chosen so that the test has the desired level of significance \(\alpha\). To see how this should be done, recall that when \(H_{0}\) is true, all seven observations come from the same population. This means that under \(H_{0}\), any possible triple of ranks associated with the three \(x\)'s -- such as (1, 4, 5), (3, 5, 6), or (5, 6, 7) -- has the same probability as any other possible rank triple. Since there are \({7\choose 3}=35\) possible rank triples, under \(H_{0}\) each rank triple has probability \(1/35\). From a list of all \(35\) rank triples and the \(w\) value associated with each, the probability distribution of \(W\) can immediately be determined. For example, there are four rank triples that have \(w\) value \(11\) -- (1, 3, 7), (1, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6), and (2, 4, 5) -- so \(P(W=11)=4/35\). The summary of the listing and computations appears in Table 14.3.

The distribution of Table 14.3 is symmetric about \(w=(6+18)/2=12\), which is the middle value in the ordered list of possible \(W\) values. This is because the two rank triples (\(r\), \(s\), \(t\)) (with \(r<s<t\)) and (\(8-t\), \(8-s\), \(8-r\)) have values of \(w\) symmetric about \(12\), so for each triple with \(w\) value below \(12\), there is a triple with \(w\) value above \(12\) by the same amount.

If the alternative hypothesis is \(H_{\rm a}\colon\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>0\), then \(H_{0}\) should be rejected in favor of \(H_{\rm a}\) for large \(W\) values. Choosing as the rejection region the set of \(W\) values {17, 18}, \(\alpha=P(\mbox{type I error})=P(\mbox{reject }H_{0}\mbox{ when }H_{0}\mbox{ is true})=P(W=17\mbox{ or }18\mbox{ when }H_{0}\mbox{ is true})=\frac{1}{35}+\frac{1}{35}=\frac{2}{35}=.057\); the region {17, 18} therefore specifies a test with level of significance approximately \(.05\). Similarly, the region {6, 7}, which is appropriate for \(H_{\rm a}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<0\), has \(\alpha=.057\approx.05\). The region {6, 7, 17, 18}, which is appropriate for the two-sided alternative, has \(\alpha=\frac{4}{35}=.114\). The \(W\) value for the data given several paragraphs previously was \(w=9\), which is rather close to the middle value \(12\), so \(H_{0}\) would not be rejected at any reasonable level \(\alpha\) for any one of the three \(H_{\rm a}\)'s.

### General Description of the Rank-Sum Test

The null hypothesis \(H_{0}\colon\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) is handled by subtracting \(\Delta_{0}\) from each \(X_{i}\) and using the (\(X_{i}-\Delta_{0}\))'s as the \(X_{i}\)'s were previously used. Recalling that for any positive integer \(K\), the sum of the first \(K\) integers is \(K(K+1)/2\), the smallest possible value of the statistic \(W\) is \(m(m+1)/2\), which occurs when the (\(X_{i}-\Delta_{0}\))'s are all to the left of the \(Y\) sample. The largest possible value of \(W\) occurs when the (\(X_{i}-\Delta_{0}\))'s lie entirely to the right of the \(Y\)'s; in this case, \(W=(n+1)+\cdots+(m+n)=(\mbox{sum of first }m+n\mbox{ integers})-(\mbox{sum of first }n\mbox{ integers})\), which gives

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c c c c c c c c c} \(w\) & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 \\ \(P(W=w)\) & \(\frac{1}{35}\) & \(\frac{1}{35}\) & \(\frac{2}{35}\) & \(\frac{3}{35}\) & \(\frac{4}{35}\) & \(\frac{4}{35}\) & \(\frac{5}{35}\) & \\(m(m+2n+1)/2\). As with the special case \(m=3\), \(n=4\), the distribution of \(W\) is symmetric about the value that is halfway between the smallest and largest values; this middle value is \(m(m+n+1)/2\). Because of this symmetry, probabilities involving lower-tail critical values can be obtained from corresponding upper-tail values.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Null hypothesis: \(H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) \\ Test statistic value : \(w=\sum_{i=1}^{m}r_{i}\) & where \(r_{i}=\) rank of \((x_{i}-\Delta_{0})\) in the combined sample of \(m+n\)\((x-\Delta_{0})\)'s and \(y\)'s \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline \(H_{a}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>\Delta_{0}\) & \(w\geq c_{1}\) \\ \(H_{a}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<\Delta_{0}\) & \(w\leq m(m+n+1)-c_{1}\) \\ \(H_{a}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\neq\Delta_{0}\) & either \(w\geq c\) or \(w\leq m(m+n+1)-c\) \\ \end{tabular}

where \(P(W\geq c_{1}\) when \(H_{0}\) is true) \(\approx\alpha\), \(P(W\geq c\) when \(H_{0}\) is true) \(\approx\alpha\)/2. \\ \end{tabular}

Because W has a discrete probability distribution, there will not always exist a critical value corresponding exactly to one of the usual levels of significance. Appendix Table 13 gives upper-tail critical values for probabilities closest to.05,.025,.01, and.005, from which level.05 or.01 one- and two-tailed tests can be obtained. The table gives information only for \(m=3\), 4,..., 8 and \(n=m\), \(m+1\),..., 8 (i.e., \(3\leq m\leq n\leq 8\)). For values of \(m\) and \(n\) that exceed 8, a normal approximation can be used (Exercise 14). To use the table for small \(m\) and \(n\), though, _the X and Y samples should be labeled so that \(m\leq n\)_.

The urinary fluoride concentration (parts per million) was measured both for a sample of livestock grazing in an area previously exposed to fluoride pollution and for a similar sample grazing in an unpolluted region:

\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Polluted** & 21.3 & 18.7 & 23.0 & 17.1 & 16.8 & 20.9 & 19.7 \\ \hline
**Unpolluted** & 14.2 & 18.3 & 17.2 & 18.4 & 20.0 & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Does the data indicate strongly that the true average fluoride concentration for livestock grazing in the polluted region is larger than for the unpolluted region? Use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at level \(\alpha=.01\).

The sample sizes here are 7 and 5. To obtain \(m\leq n\), label the unpolluted observations as the \(x\)'s (\(x_{1}=14.2\),..., \(x_{5}=20.0\)) and the polluted observations as the \(y\)'s. Thus \(\mu_{1}\) is the true average fluoride concentration without pollution, and \(\mu_{2}\) is the true average concentration with pollution. The alternative hypothesis is \(H_{a}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<0\) (pollution causes an increase in concentration), so a lower-tailedtest is appropriate. From Appendix Table A.13 with \(m=5\) and \(n=7\), \(P(W\geq 47\) when \(H_{0}\) is true) \(\approx.01\). The critical value for the lower-tailed test is therefore \(m(m+n+1)-47=5(13)-47=18\); \(H_{0}\) will now be rejected if \(w\leq 18\). The pooled ordered sample follows; the computed \(W\) is \(w=r_{1}+r_{2}+\cdots+r_{5}\) (where \(r_{i}\) is the rank of \(x_{i}\)) = 1 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 25. Since 25 is not \(\leq 18\), \(H_{0}\) is not rejected at (approximately) level.01.

Ties are handled as suggested for the signed-rank test in the previous section.

## Efficiency of the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test

When the distributions being sampled are both normal with \(\sigma_{1}=\sigma_{2}\), and therefore have the same shapes and spreads, either the pooled \(t\) test or the Wilcoxon test can be used (the two-sample \(t\) test assumes normality but not equal variances, so assumptions underlying its use are more restrictive in one sense and less in another than those for Wilcoxon's test). In this situation, the pooled \(t\) test is best among all possible tests in the sense of minimizing \(\beta\) for any fixed \(\alpha\). However, an investigator can never be absolutely certain that underlying assumptions are satisfied. It is therefore relevant to ask (1) how much is lost by using Wilcoxon's test rather than the pooled \(t\) test when the distributions are normal with equal variances and (2) how \(W\) compares to \(T\) in nonnormal situations.

The notion of test efficiency was discussed in the previous section in connection with the one-sample \(t\) test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The results for the two-sample tests are the same as those for the one-sample tests. When normality and equal variances both hold, the rank-sum test is approximately 95% as efficient as the pooled \(t\) test in large samples. That is, the \(t\) test will give the same error probabilities as the Wilcoxon test using slightly smaller sample sizes. On the other hand, the Wilcoxon test will always be at least 86% as efficient as the pooled \(t\) test and may be much more efficient if the underlying distributions are very nonnormal, especially with heavy tails. The comparison of the Wilcoxon test with the two-sample (unpooled) \(t\) test is less clear-cut. The \(t\) test is not known to be the best test in any sense, so it seems safe to conclude that as long as the population distributions have similar shapes and spreads, the behavior of the Wilcoxon test should compare quite favorably to the two-sample \(t\) test.

Lastly, we note that \(\beta\) calculations for the Wilcoxon test are quite difficult. This is because the distribution of \(W\) when \(H_{0}\) is false depends not only on \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) but also on the shapes of the two distributions. For most underlying distributions, the nonnull distribution of \(W\) is virtually intractable. This is why statisticians have developed large-sample (asymptotic relative) efficiency as a means of comparing tests. With the capabilities of modern-day computer software, another approach to calculation of \(\beta\) is to carry out a simulation experiment.

## 10 Examples

* In an experiment to compare the bond strength of two different adhesives, each adhesive was used in five bondings of two surfaces, and the force necessary to separate the surfaces was determined for each bonding. For adhesive 1, the resulting values were 229, 286, 245, 299, and 250, whereas the adhesive 2 observations were 213, 179, 163, 247, and 225. Let \(\mu_{i}\) denote the true average bond strength of adhesive type \(i\). Use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at level.05 to test \(H_{0}:\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}\) versus \(H_{\pm}\): \(\mu_{1}>\mu_{2}\).
* The article "A Study of Wood Stove Particulate Emissions" (_J. Air Pollut. Contr. Assoc._, 1979: 724-728) reports the following data on burn time (hours) for samples of oak and pine. Test at level.05 to see whether there is any difference in true average burn time for the two types of wood. _Oak_ 1.72.67 1.55 1.56 1.42 1.23 1.77.48 _Pine_.98 1.40 1.33 1.52.73 1.20
* A modification has been made to the process for producing a certain type of "time-zero" film (film that begins to develop as soon as a picture is taken). Because the modification involves extra cost, it will be incorporated only if sample data strongly indicates that the modification has decreased true average developing time by more than 1 s. Assuming that the developing-time distributions differ only with respect to location if at all, use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test at level.05 on the accompanying data to test the appropriate hypotheses. _Original Process_ 8.6 5.1 4.5 5.4 6.3 6.6 5.7 8.5 _Modified Process_ 5.5 4.0 3.8 6.0 5.8 4.9 7.0 5.7
* The article "Measuring the Exposure of Infants to Tobacco Smoke" (_New Engl. J. Med._, 1984: 1075-1078) reports on a study in which various measurements were taken both from a random sample of infants who had been exposed to household smoke and from a sample of unexposed infants. The accompanying data consists of observations on urinary concentration of cotinine, a major metabolite of nicotine (the values constitute a subset of the original data and were read from a plot that appeared in the article). Does the data suggest that true average cotinine level is higher in exposed infants than in unexposed infants by more than 25?

However, if \(a\) and \(b\) are any two distinct positive integers between 1 and \(m+n\) inclusive, it follows that \(P(R_{i}=a\,\text{and}\,R_{j}=b)=1/[(m+n)(m+n-1)]\) since two integers are being sampled without replacement from among 1, 2, \(\ldots\), \(m+n\).

## 14 Distribution-Free Confidence Intervals

The method we have used so far to construct a confidence interval (CI) can be described as follows: Start with a random variable (_Z_, \(T\), _kh_2, \(F\), or the like) that depends on the parameter of interest and a probability statement involving the variable, manipulate the inequalities of the statement to isolate the parameter between random endpoints, and finally substitute computed values for random variables. Another general method for obtaining CIs takes advantage of a relationship between test procedures and CIs. A 100(1 - _a_)% CI for a parameter _th_ can be obtained from a level \(a\) test for \(H\)0: _th_ = _th_0 versus _H_a: _th_ = _th_0. This method will be used to derive intervals associated with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Before using the method to derive new intervals, reconsider the \(t\) test and the \(t\) interval. Suppose a random sample of \(n\) = 25 observations from a normal population yields summary statistics \(\overline{x}\)= 100, \(s\) = 20. Then a 90% CI for \(m\) is

\[\left(\overline{x}-t_{.05,24}\cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{25}},\overline{x}+t_{.05,24} \cdot\frac{s}{\sqrt{25}}\right)=(93.16,106.84) \tag{14.2}\]

Suppose that instead of a CI, we had wished to test a hypothesis about \(m\). For \(H\)0: \(m\) = \(m\)0 versus _H_a: \(m\) _m_ \(m\)0, the \(t\) test at level.10 specifies that \(H\)0 should be rejected if \(t\) is either >= 1.711 or <= -1.711, where

\[t=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu_{0}}{s/\sqrt{25}}=\frac{100-\mu_{0}}{20/\sqrt{25}}= \frac{100-\mu_{0}}{4} \tag{14.3}\]

Consider now the null value \(m\)0 = 95. Then \(t\) = 1.25, so \(H\)0 is not rejected. Similarly, if \(m\)0 = 104, then \(t\) = -1, so again \(H\)0 is not rejected. However, if \(m\)0 = 90, then \(t\) = 2.5, so \(H\)0 is rejected, and if \(m\)0 = 108, then \(t\) = -2, so \(H\)0 is again rejected. By considering other values of \(m\)0 and the decision resulting from each one, the following general fact emerges: _Every number inside the interval_ (14.2) _specifies a value of \(\mu_{0}\) for which \(t\) of_ (14.3) _leads to nonrejection of \(H_{0}\), whereas every number outside interval_ (14.2) _corresponds to a \(t\) for which \(H_{0}\) is rejected_. That is, for the fixed values of \(n\), \(\overline{x}\), and \(s\), the interval (14.2) is precisely the set of all \(\mu_{0}\) values for which testing \(H_{0}\colon\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\mathrm{a}}\colon\mu\neq\mu_{0}\) results in not rejecting \(H_{0}\).

\begin{tabular}{c c} PROPOSITION & Suppose we have a level \(\alpha\) test procedure for testing \(H_{0}\colon\theta=\theta_{0}\) versus \(H_{\mathrm{a}}\colon\theta\neq\theta_{0}\). For fixed sample values, let \(A\) denote the set of all values \(\theta_{0}\) for which \(H_{0}\) is not rejected. Then \(A\) is a 100(1 \(-\)\(\alpha\))\% CI for \(\theta\). \\ \end{tabular}

There are actually pathological examples in which the set \(A\) defined in the proposition is not an interval of \(\theta\) values, but instead the complement of an interval or something even stranger. To be more precise, we should really replace the notion of a CI with that of a confidence set. In the cases of interest here, the set \(A\) does turn out to be an interval.

### The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Interval

To test \(H_{0}\colon\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\mathrm{a}}\colon\mu\neq\mu_{0}\) using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, where \(\mu\) is the mean of a continuous symmetric distribution, the absolute values \(|x_{1}-\mu_{0}|,\ldots,|x_{n}-\mu_{0}|\) are ordered from smallest to largest, with the smallest receiving rank 1 and the largest, rank \(n\). Each rank is then given the sign of its associated \(x_{i}-\mu_{0}\), and the test statistic is the sum of the positively signed ranks. The two-tailed test rejects \(H_{0}\) if \(s_{+}\) is either \(\geq c\) or \(\leq n(n+1)/2-c\), where \(c\) is obtained from Appendix Table A.12 once the desired level of significance \(\alpha\) is specified. For fixed \(x_{1}\), \(\ldots\), \(x_{n}\), the 100(1 \(-\)\(\alpha\))% signed-rank interval will consist of all \(\mu_{0}\) for which \(H_{0}\colon\mu=\mu_{0}\) is not rejected at level \(\alpha\). To identify this interval, it is convenient to express the test statistic \(S_{+}\) in another form.

\begin{tabular}{c c} \(S_{+}=\) & the number of pairwise averages \(\bigl{(}X_{i}+X_{j}\bigr{)}/2\) with \(i\leq j\) \\  & that are \(\geq\mu_{0}\) \\ \end{tabular}  (14.4)

That is, if we average each \(x_{j}\) in the list with each \(x_{i}\) to its left, including \((x_{j}+x_{j})/2\) (which is just \(x_{j}\)), and count the number of these averages that are \(\geq\mu_{0},s_{+}\) results. In moving from left to right in the list of sample values, we are simply averaging every pair of observations in the sample [again including \((x_{j}+x_{j})/2\)] exactly once, so the order in which the observations are listed before averaging is not important. The equivalence of the two methods for computing \(s_{+}\) is not difficult to verify. The number of pairwise averages is \(\binom{n}{2}+n\) (the first term due to averaging of different observations and the second due to averaging each \(x_{i}\) with itself), which equals \(n(n+1)/2\). If either too many or too few of these pairwise averages are \(\geq\mu_{0}\), \(H_{0}\) is rejected.

The following observations are values of cerebral metabolic rate for rhesus monkeys: \(x_{1}=4.51\), \(x_{2}=4.59\), \(x_{3}=4.90\), \(x_{4}=4.93\), \(x_{5}=6.80\), \(x_{6}=5.08\), \(x_{7}=5.67\). The 28 pairwise averages are, in increasing order,

\[\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}4.51&4.55&4.59&4.705&4.72&4.745&4.76&4.795&4.835&4.90 \\ 4.915&4.93&4.99&5.005&5.08&5.09&5.13&5.285&5.30&5.375\\ 5.655&5.67&5.695&5.85&5.865&5.94&6.235&6.80&\\ \end{array}\]

The first few and the last few of these are pictured on a measurement axis in Figure 14.2.

Because of the discreteness of the distribution of \(S_{+}\), \(\alpha=.05\) cannot be obtained exactly. The rejection region {0, 1, 2, 26, 27, 28} has \(\alpha=.046\), which is as close as possible to.05, so the level is approximately.05. Thus if the number of pairwise averages \(\geq\mu_{0}\) is between 3 and 25, inclusive, \(H_{0}\) is not rejected. From Figure 14.2 the (approximate) 95% CI for \(\mu\) is (4.59, 5.94).

In general, once the pairwise averages are ordered from smallest to largest, the endpoints of the Wilcoxon interval are two of the "extreme" averages. To express this precisely, let the smallest pairwise average be denoted by \(\overline{x}_{(1)}\), the next smallest by \(\overline{x}_{(2)}\),..., and the largest by \(\overline{x}_{(n(n+1)/2)}\).

**PROPOSITION**: If the level \(\alpha\) Wilcoxon signed-rank test for \(H_{0}\) : \(\mu=\mu_{0}\) versus \(H_{\rm a}\) : \(\mu\neq\mu_{0}\) is to reject \(H_{0}\) if either \(s_{+}\geq c\) or \(s_{+}\leq n(n+1)/2\ -\ c\), then a 100(1 \(-\ \alpha\))% CI for \(\mu\) is

\[(\overline{x}_{(n(n+1)/2-c+1)},\overline{x}_{(c)}) \tag{14.5}\]

In words, the interval extends from the \(d\)th smallest pairwise average to the \(d\)th largest average, where \(d=n(n+1)/2-c+1\). Appendix Table A.14 gives the values of \(c\) that correspond to the usual confidence levels for \(n=\) 5, 6,..., 25.

For \(n=7\), an 89.1% interval (approximately 90%) is obtained by using \(c=24\) (since the rejection region {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28} has \(\alpha=.109\)). The interval is \((\overline{x}_{(28-24+1)},\overline{x}_{(24)})=(\overline{x}_{(5)},\overline {x}_{(24)})=(4.72,\ 5.85)\), which extends from the fifth smallest to the fifth largest pairwise average.

Figure 14.2: Plot of the data for Example 14.4

The derivation of the interval depended on having a single sample from a continuous symmetric distribution with mean (median) \(\mu\). When the data is paired, the interval constructed from the differences \(d_{1}\), \(d_{2}\),..., \(d_{n}\) is a CI for the mean (median) difference \(\mu_{D}\). In this case, the symmetry of \(X\) and \(Y\) distributions need not be assumed; as long as the \(X\) and \(Y\) distributions have the same shape, the \(X-Y\) distribution will be symmetric, so only continuity is required.

For \(n>20\), the large-sample approximation (Exercise 6) to the Wilcoxon test based on standardizing \(S_{+}\) gives an approximation to \(c\) in (14.5). The result [for a 100(1 \(-\)\(\alpha\))% interval] is

\[c\approx\frac{n(n+1)}{4}+z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{24}}\]

The efficiency of the Wilcoxon interval relative to the \(t\) interval is roughly the same as that for the Wilcoxon test relative to the \(t\) test. In particular, for large samples when the underlying population is normal, the Wilcoxon interval will tend to be slightly longer than the \(t\) interval, but if the population is quite nonnormal (symmetric but with heavy tails), then the Wilcoxon interval will tend to be much shorter than the \(t\) interval. And as we emphasized earlier in our discussion of bootstrapping, in the presence of nonnormality the actual confidence level of the \(t\) interval may differ considerably from the nominal (e.g., 95%) level.

## The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Interval

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test for testing \(H_{0}:\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) is carried out by first combining the (\(X_{i}\)\(-\)\(\Delta_{0}\))'s and \(Y_{j}\)'s into one sample of size \(m+n\) and ranking them from smallest (rank 1) to largest (rank \(m+n\)). The test statistic \(W\) is then the sum of the ranks of the (\(X_{i}-\Delta_{0}\))'s. For the two-sided alternative, \(H_{0}\) is rejected if \(w\) is either too small or too large.

To obtain the associated CI for fixed \(x_{i}\)'s and \(y_{j}\)'s, we must determine the set of all \(\Delta_{0}\) values for which \(H_{0}\) is not rejected. This is easiest to do if we first express the test statistic in a slightly different form. The smallest possible value of \(W\) is \(m(m+1)/2\), corresponding to every (\(X_{i}\)\(-\)\(\Delta_{0}\)) less than every \(Y_{j}\), and there are \(mn\) differences of the form (\(X_{i}\)\(-\)\(\Delta_{0}\)) \(-\)\(Y_{j}\). A bit of manipulation gives

\[\eqalign{W&=[\hbox{number of }(X_{i}-Y_{j}-\Delta_{0})\hbox{'s}\geq 0]+\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\cr&=[\hbox{number of }(X_{i}-Y_{j})\hbox{'s}\geq\Delta_{0}]+\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\cr}\]

Thus rejecting \(H_{0}\) if the number of (\(x_{i}\)\(-\)\(y_{j}\))'s \(\geq\Delta_{0}\) is either too small or too large is equivalent to rejecting \(H_{0}\) for small or large \(w\).

Expression (14.6) suggests that we compute \(x_{i}\)\(-\)\(y_{j}\) for each \(i\) and \(j\) and order these \(mn\) differences from smallest to largest. Then if the null value \(\Delta_{0}\) is neither smaller than most of the differences nor larger than most, \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=\Delta_{0}\) is not rejected. Varying \(\Delta_{0}\) now shows that a CI for \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}\) will have as its lower endpoint one of the ordered (\(x_{i}\)\(-\)\(y_{i}\))'s, and similarly for the upper endpoint.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:788]

\[c\approx\frac{mn}{2}+z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{mn(m+n+1)}{12}} \tag{14.8}\]

As with the signed-rank interval, the rank-sum interval (14.7) is quite efficient with respect to the \(t\) interval; in large samples, (14.7) will tend to be only a bit longer than the \(t\) interval when the underlying populations are normal and may be considerably shorter than the \(t\) interval if the underlying populations have heavier tails than do normal populations. And once again, the actual confidence level for the \(t\) interval may be quite different from the nominal level in the presence of substantial nonnormality.

17. The article "The Lead Content and Acidity of Christchurch Precipitation" (_New Zeal. J. Sci._, 1980: 311-312) reports the accompanying data on lead concentration (\(\mu\)g/L) in samples gathered during eight different summer rainfalls: 17.0, 21.4, 30.6, 5.0, 12.2, 11.8, 17.3, and 18.8. Assuming that the lead-content distribution is symmetric, use the Wilcoxon signed-rank interval to obtain a 95% CI for \(\mu\).

19. Compute a CI for \(\mu_{D}\) of Example 14.2 using the data given there; your confidence level should be roughly 95%.

### 14.4 Bayesian Methods

Consider making an inference about some parameter \(\theta\). The "frequentist" or "classical" approach, which we have followed until now in this book, is to regard the value of \(\theta\) as fixed but unknown, observe data from a joint pmf or pdf \(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n};\theta)\), and use the observations to draw appropriate conclusions. The Bayesian or "subjective" paradigm is different. Again the value of \(\theta\) is unknown, but Bayesians say that all available information about it--intuition, data from past experiments, expert opinions, etc. --can be incorporated into a _prior distribution_, usually a prior pdf \(g(\theta)\) since there will typically be a continuum of possible values of the parameter rather than just a discrete set. If there is substantial knowledge about \(\theta\), the prior will be quite peaked and highly concentrated about some central value, whereas a lack of information is shown by a relatively flat "uninformative" prior. These possibilities are illustrated in Figure 14.3.

In essence we are now thinking of the actual value of \(\theta\) as the observed value of a random variable \(\Theta\), although unfortunately we ourselves don't get to observe the value. The (prior) distribution of this random variable is \(g(\theta)\). Now, just as in the frequentist scenario, an experiment is performed to obtain data. The joint pmf or pdf of the data given the value of \(\theta\) is \(p(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\,|\,\theta)\) or \(f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\,|\,\theta)\). We use a vertical line segment here rather than the earlier semicolon to emphasize that we are conditioning on the value of a random variable.

At this point, an appropriate version of Bayes' theorem is used to obtain \(h(\theta|x_{1},\ldots.x_{n})\), the _posterior_ distribution of the parameter. In the Bayesian world, this posterior distribution contains all current information about \(\theta\). In particular, the mean of this posterior distribution gives a point estimate of the parameter. An interval [\(a\), \(b\)] having posterior probability.95 gives a 95% _credibility_ interval, the Bayesian analogue of a 95% confidence interval (but the interpretation is different). After presenting the necessary version of Bayes' Theorem, we illustrate the Bayesian approach with two examples.

Bayes' theorem here needs to be a bit more general than in Section 2.4 to allow for the possibility of continuous distributions. This version gives the posterior distribution \(h(\theta\,|\,x_{1},\,x_{2},\,\ldots,\,x_{n})\) as a product of the prior pdf times the conditional pdf, with a denominator to assure that the total posterior probability is 1:

\[h(\theta|x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})=\frac{f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}|\theta)g( \theta)}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}|\theta)g(\theta)d\theta}\]

Suppose we want to make an inference about a population proportion \(p\). Since the value of this parameter must be between 0 and 1, and the family of standard beta distributions is concentrated on the interval [0, 1], a particular beta distribution is a natural choice for a prior on \(p\). In particular, consider data from a survey of 1574 American adults reported by the National Science Foundation in May 2002. Of those responding, 803 (51%) incorrectly said that antibiotics kill viruses. In accord with the discussion in Section 3.5, the data can be considered either a random sample of 1574 from the Bernoulli distribution (binomial with number of trials \(=\) 1) or a single observation from the binomial distribution with \(n=1574\). We use the latter approach here, but Exercise 23 involves showing that the Bernoulli approach is equivalent.

Figure 14.3: A narrow concentrated prior and a wider less informative prior

Assuming a beta prior for \(p\) on [0,1] with parameters \(a\) and \(b\) and the binomial distribution Bin(_n_ = 1574, _p_) for the data, we get for the posterior distribution,

\[h(p|x)=\frac{f(x|p)g(p)}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x|p)g(p)dp}=\frac{\binom{n}{x} p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}p^{a-1}(1-p)^{b-1}}{\int_{0}^{1}\binom{n}{x} p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}p^{a-1}(1-p)^{b-1}dp}.\]

The numerator can be written as

\[\binom{n}{x}\frac{\Gamma(a+b)}{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}\frac{\Gamma(x+a)\Gamma(n-x+ b)}{\Gamma(n+a+b)}\left[\frac{\Gamma(n+a+b)}{\Gamma(x+a)\Gamma(n-x+b)}p^{x+a-1}(1-p)^{n-x+b-1}\right].\]

Given that the part in square brackets is of the form of a beta pdf on \([0,1]\), its integral over this interval is 1. The part in front of the square brackets is shared by the numerator and denominator, and will therefore cancel. Thus

\[h(p|x)=\frac{\Gamma(n+a+b)}{\Gamma(x+a)\Gamma(n-x+b)}p^{x+a-1}(1-p)^{n-x+b-1}\]

That is, the posterior distribution of \(p\) is itself a beta distribution with parameters \(x\) + \(a\) and \(n\) - \(x\) + \(b\).

If we were using the traditional non-Bayesian frequentist approach to statistics, and we wanted to give an estimate of \(p\) for this example, we would give the usual estimate from Section 8.2, _x_/_n_ = 803/1574 =.51. The usual Bayesian estimate is the posterior mean, the expected value of \(p\) given the data. Recalling that the mean of the beta distribution on [0, 1] is \(\alpha/(\alpha+\beta)\), we obtain

\[E(p|x)=(x+a)/(n+a+b)=(803+a)/(1574+a+b)\]

for the posterior mean.

Suppose that \(a\) = \(b\) = 1, so the beta prior distribution reduces to the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Then _E_(_p_|_x_) = (803 + 1)/(1574 + 2) =.51, and in this case the Bayesian and frequentist results are essentially the same. It should be apparent that, if \(a\) and \(b\) are small compared to \(n\), then the prior distribution will not matter much. Indeed, if \(a\) and \(b\) are close to 0 and positive, then _E_(_p_|_x_) \(\approx x/n\). We should hesitate to set \(a\) and \(b\) equal to 0, because this would make the beta prior pdf not integrable, but it does nevertheless give a reasonable posterior distribution if \(x\) and \(n\) - \(x\) are positive. When a prior distribution is not integrable it is said to be **improper**.

In Bayesian inference, is there an interval corresponding to the confidence interval for \(p\) given in Section 8.2? We have the posterior distribution for \(p\), so we can take the central 95% of this distribution and call it a 95% credibility interval, as mentioned at the beginning of this section. In the case with a beta prior and \(a\) = 1, \(b\) = 1, we have a beta posterior with \(a\) = 804, \(b\) = 772. Using the inverse cumulative beta distribution function from MINITAB (or almost any major statistical package) evaluated at.025 and.975, we obtain the interval [.4855,.5348]. For comparison the 95% confidence interval from Equation (8.10) of Section 8.2 is [.4855,.5348]. The intervals are not exactly the same, although they do agree to four decimals. The simpler formula, Equation (8.11), gives the answer [.4855,.5349], which is very close because of the large sample size.

It is interesting that, although the frequentist and Bayesian intervals agree to four decimals, they have very different interpretations. For the Bayesian interval we can say that the probability is 95% that \(p\) is in the interval, given the data. However, this is not correct for the frequentist interval, because \(p\) is not random and the endpoints are not random after they have been specified, and therefore no probability statement is appropriate. Here the 95% applies to the aggregate of confidence intervals, of which in the long run 95% should include the true \(p\).

The confidence intervals and credibility interval all include.5, so they allow the possibility that \(p\) =.5. Another way to view this possibility in Bayesian terms is to see whether the posterior distribution is consistent with \(p\) =.5. We actually consider the related hypothesis \(p\) <=.5. Using \(a\) = 1 and \(b\) = 1 again, we find from MINITAB that the beta distribution with \(a\) = 804 and \(b\) = 772 has probability.2100 of being less than or equal to.5. The corresponding one-tailed frequentist _P_-value is the probability, assuming \(p\) =.5, of at least 803 successes in 1574 trials, which is.2173. Both the Bayesian and frequentist values are much greater than.05, and there is no reason to reject.5 as a possible value for \(p\).

To clarify the relationship between _E_(_p_|_x_) and _x_/_n_, we can write _E_(_p_|_x_) as a weighted average of the prior mean _a_/(_a_ + _b_) and _x_/_n_.

\[E(p|x) = \frac{a + b}{n + a + b} \cdot \frac{a}{a + b} + \frac{n}{n + a + b} \cdot \frac{x}{n}\]

The weights can be interpreted in terms of the sum of the two parameters of the beta distribution, which is often called the **concentration parameter**. The weights are proportional to the concentration parameter \(a\) + \(b\) of the prior distribution and the number \(n\) of observations. The weight of the prior depends on the size of \(a\) + \(b\) in relation to \(n\), and the concentration parameter of the posterior distribution is the total \(a\) + \(b\) + \(n\).

It is also useful to interpret the posterior pdf in terms of the concentration parameter. Because the first parameter is the sum \(x\) + \(a\) and the second parameter is the sum (_n_ - _x_) + \(b\), the effect of \(a\) is to add to the number of successes and the effect of \(b\) is to add to the number of failures. In particular, setting \(a\) to 1 and \(b\) to 1 resulted in a posterior with the equivalent of 803 + 1 successes and (1574 - 803) + 1 failures, for a total of 1574 + 2 observations. From this viewpoint, the total observations are the \(a\) + \(b\) provided by the prior plus the \(n\) provided by the data, and this addition also gives the concentration parameter of the posterior in terms of the concentration parameter of the prior.

How should we specify the prior distribution? The beta distribution is convenient, because it is easy with this specification to find the posterior distribution, but what about \(a\) and _b_? Suppose we have asked 10 adults about the effect of antibiotics on viruses, and it is reasonable to assume that the 10 are a random sample. If 6 of the 10 say that antibiotics kill viruses, then we set \(a\) = 6 and \(b\) = 10 - 6 = 4. That is, we have a beta distributed prior with parameters 6 and 4. Then the posterior distribution is beta with parameters 803 + 6 = 809 and (1574 - 803) + 4 = 775. The posterior is the same as if we had started with \(a\) = 0 and \(b\) = 0 and observed 809 who said that antibiotics kill viruses and 775 who 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:793]

The posterior is then

\[h(\mu|x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})=\frac{\frac{\sigma_{1}}{{(2\pi)}^{n/2}\sigma^{n} \sigma_{0}}\cdot\frac{1}{{(2\pi)}^{5}\sigma_{1}}e^{(-5/\sigma_{1}^{2})(\mu-\mu_ {1})^{2}}e^{C}}{\frac{\sigma_{1}}{{(2\pi)}^{n/2}\sigma^{n}\sigma_{0}}e^{C}\int_ {-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{{(2\pi)}^{5}\sigma_{1}}e^{(-5/\sigma_{1}^{2})(\mu- \mu_{1})^{2}}d\mu}\]

The integral is 1 because it is the area under a normal pdf, and the part in front of the integral cancels out, leaving a posterior distribution that is normal with mean \(\mu_{1}\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}\):

\[h(\mu|x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})=\frac{1}{{(2\pi)}^{5}\sigma_{1}}e^{(-5/\sigma_ {1}^{2})(\mu-\mu_{1})^{2}}\]

Notice that the posterior mean \(\mu_{1}\) is a weighted average of the prior mean \(\mu_{0}\) and the data mean \(\overline{x}\), with weights that are the reciprocals of the prior variance and the variance of \(\overline{x}\). It makes sense to define the **precision** as the reciprocal of the variance because a lower variance implies a more precise measurement, and the weights then are the corresponding precisions. Furthermore, the posterior variance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the two variances, but this can be described much more simply by saying that the posterior precision is the sum of the prior precision plus the precision of \(\overline{x}\).

Numerically, we have

\[\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}^{2}}=\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}/n}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}=\frac {1}{15^{2}/18}+\frac{1}{7.5^{2}}=.09778=\frac{1}{10.227}=\frac{1}{3.198^{2}}\]

\[\mu_{1}=\frac{\frac{n\overline{x}}{\sigma^{2}}+\frac{\mu_{0}}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}}{ \frac{n}{\sigma^{2}}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{0}^{2}}}=\frac{\frac{18(118.28)}{15^{2}}+ \frac{110}{7.5^{2}}}{\frac{18}{15^{2}}+\frac{1}{7.5^{2}}}=116.77\]

The posterior distribution is normal with mean \(\mu_{1}=116.77\) and standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}=3.198\). The mean \(\mu_{1}\) is a weighted average of \(\overline{x}=118.28\) and \(\mu_{0}=110\), so \(\mu_{1}\) is necessarily between them. As \(n\) becomes large the weight given to \(\mu_{0}\) declines, and \(\mu_{1}\) will be closer to \(\overline{x}\).

Knowing the mean and standard deviation, we can use the normal distribution to find an interval with 95% probability for \(\mu\). This 95% credibility interval is [110.502, 123.038]. For comparison the 95% confidence interval using \(\overline{x}=118.28\) and \(\sigma=15\) is \(\overline{x}\pm 1.96\sigma/\sqrt{n}=[111.35,\ 125.21]\). Notice that this interval must be wider. Because the precisions add to give the posterior precision, the posterior precision is greater than the prior precision and it is greater than the data precision. Therefore, it is guaranteed that the posterior standard deviation \(\sigma_{1}\) will be less than \(\sigma_{0}\) and less than the data standard deviation \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\).

Both the credibility interval and the confidence interval exclude 110, so we can be pretty sure that \(\mu\) exceeds 110. Another way of looking at this is to calculate the posterior probability of \(\mu\) being less than or equal to 110. Using \(\mu_{1}=116.77\) and \(\sigma_{1}=3.198\), we obtain the probability.0171, so this too supports the idea that \(\mu\) exceeds 110.

How should we go about choosing \(\mu_{0}\) and \(\sigma_{0}\) for the prior distribution? Suppose we have four prior observations for which the mean is 110. The standard deviation of the mean is \(15/\sqrt{4}\). We therefore choose \(\mu_{0}=110\) and \(\sigma_{0}=7.5\), the same values used for this example. If the four values are combined with the 18 values from the data set, then the mean of all 22 is \(116.77=\mu_{1}\) and the standard deviation is \(15/\sqrt{22}=3.198=\sigma_{1}\). The 95% confidence interval for the mean, based on the average of all 22 observations, is the same as the Bayesian 95% credibility interval. This says that if you have some preliminary data values that are just as good as the regular data values that will be obtained, then base the prior distribution on the preliminary data. The posterior mean and its standard deviation will be the same as if the preliminary data were combined with the regular data, and the 95% credibility interval will be the same as the 95% confidence interval.

It should be emphasized that, even if the confidence interval is the same as the credibility interval, they have different interpretations. To interpret the Bayesian credibility interval, we can say that the probability is 95% that \(\mu\) is in the interval [110.502, 123.038]. However, for the frequentist confidence interval such a probability statement does not make sense because \(\mu\) and the endpoints of the interval are all constants after the interval has been calculated. Instead we have the more complicated interpretation that, in repeated realizations of the confidence interval, 95% of the intervals will include the true \(\mu\) in the long run.

What should be done if there are no prior observations and there are no strong opinions about the prior mean \(\mu_{0}\)? In this case the prior standard deviation \(\sigma_{0}\) can be taken as some large number much bigger than \(\sigma\), such as \(\sigma_{0}=1000\) in our example. The result is that the prior will have essentially no effect, and the posterior distribution will be based on the data, \(\mu_{1}=\overline{x}=118.28\) and \(\sigma_{1}=\sigma=15\). The 95% credibility interval will be the same as the 95% confidence interval based on the 18 observations, [111.35, 125.21], but of course the interpretation is different. \(\blacksquare\)

In both examples it turned out that the posterior distribution has the same form as the prior distribution. When this happens we say that the prior distribution is **conjugate** to the data distribution. Exercises 31 and 32 offer additional examples of conjugate distributions.

## 13 Exercises

Section 14.4 (23-32)

**23**: For the data of Example 14.7 assume a beta prior distribution and assume that the 1574 observations are a random sample from the Bernoulli distribution. Use Bayes' theorem to derive the posterior distribution, and compare your answer with the result of Example 14.7.

**24**: Here are the IQ scores for the 15 first-grade girls from the study mentioned in Example 14.8.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l}
102 & 96 & 106 & 118 & 108 & 122 & 115 & 113 \\
109 & 113 & 82 & 110 & 121 & 110 & 99 \\ \end{tabular}

Assume the same prior distribution used in Example 14.8, and assume that the data is a random sample from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and \(\sigma=15\).

**a.**: Find the posterior distribution of \(\mu\).

**b.**: Find a 95% credibility interval for \(\mu\).

**c.**: Add four observations with average 110 to the data and find a 95% confidence interval for \(\mu\) using the 19 observations. Compare with the result of (b).

**d.**: Change the prior so the prior precision is very small but positive, and then recompute (a) and (b).

**e.**: Find a 95% confidence interval for \(\mu\) using the 15 observations and compare with the credibility interval of (d).

**25**: Laplace's rule of succession says that if there have been \(n\) Bernoulli trials and they have all been successes, then the probability of a success on the next trial is \((n+1)/(n+2)\). For the derivation Laplace used a beta prior with \(a=1\) and \(b=1\) for binomial data, as in Example 14.7.

**a.**: Show that, if \(a=1\) and \(b=1\) and there are \(n\) successes in \(n\) trials, then the posterior mean of \(p\) is \((n+1)/(n+2)\).

**b.**: Explain (a) in terms of total successes and failures; that is, explain the result in terms of two prior trials plus \(n\) later trials.

**c.**: Laplace applied his rule of succession to compute the probability that the sun will rise tomorrow using 5000 years, or \(n=1,\)826,214 days of history in which the sun rose every day. Is Laplace's method equivalent to including two prior days when the sun rose once and failed to rise once? Criticize the answer in terms of total successes and failures.
**26.**: For the scenario of Example 14.8 assume the same normal prior distribution but assume that the data set is just one observation \(\overline{x}=118.28\) with standard deviation \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}=15/\sqrt{18}=3.5355\). Use Bayes' theorem to derive the posterior distribution, and compare your answer with the result of Example 14.8.

**33.**: The article "Effects of a Rice-Rich Versus Potato-Rich Diet on Glucose, Lipoprotein, and Cholesterol Metabolism in Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes" (_Amer. J. Clin. Nutrit._, 1984: 598-606) gives the accompanying data on cholesterol-synthesis rate for eight diabetic subjects. Subjects were fed a standardized diet with potato or rice as the major carbohydrate source. Participants received both diets for specified periods of time, with cholesterol-synthesis rate (mmol/day) measured at the end of each dietary period. The analysis presented in this article used a distribution-free test. Use such a test with significance level.05 to determine whether the true mean cholesterol-synthesis rate differs significantly for the two sources of carbohydrates.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Subject** & **1** & **2** & **3** & **4** & **5** & **6** & **7** & **8** \\ \hline
**Potato** & 1.88 & 2.60 & 1.38 & 4.41 & 1.87 & 2.89 & 3.96 & 2.31 \\
**Rice** & 1.70 & 3.84 & 1.13 & 4.97 &.86 & 1.93 & 3.36 & 2.15 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

34. The study reported in "Gait Patterns During Free Choice Ladder Ascents" (_Hum. Movement Sci._, 1983: 187-195) was motivated by publicity concerning the increased accident rate for individuals climbing ladders. A number of different gait patterns were used by subjects climbing a portable straight ladder according to specified instructions. The ascent times for seven subjects who used a lateral gait and six subjects who used a four-beat diagonal gait are given.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \hline
**Lateral** &.86 & 1.31 & 1.64 & 1.51 & 1.53 & 1.39 & 1.09 \\
**Diagonal** & 1.27 & 1.82 & 1.66 &.85 & 1.45 & 1.24 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* Carry out a test using \(\alpha=.05\) to see whether the data suggests any difference in the true average ascent times for the two gaits.
* Compute a 95% CI for the difference between the true average gait times.
* The **sign test*
* is a very simple procedure for testing hypotheses about a population median assuming only that the underlying distribution is continuous. To illustrate, consider the following sample of 20 observations on component lifetime (hr): 1.7 3.3 5.1 6.9 12.6 14.4 16.4 24.6 26.0 26.5 32.1 37.4 40.1 40.5 41.5 72.4 80.1 86.4 87.5 100.2 We wish to test the hypotheses \(H_{0}:\widetilde{\mu}=25.0\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}:\widetilde{\mu}>25.0\) The test statistic is \(Y=\) the number of observations that exceed 25.
* Consider rejecting \(H_{0}\) if \(Y\geq 15\). What is the value of \(\alpha\) (the probability of a type I error) for this test? [_Hint_: Think of a "success" as a lifetime that exceeds 25.0. Then \(Y\) is the number of successes in the sample. What kind of a distribution does \(Y\) have when \(\widetilde{\mu}=25.0?\)]
* What rejection region of the form \(Y\geq c\) specifies a test with a significance level as close to.05 as possible? Use this region to carry out the test for the given data. [_Note_: The test statistic is the number of differences \(X_{i}-25.0\) that have positive signs, hence the name _sign test_.]
* Refer to Exercise 35, and consider a confidence interval associated with the sign test, the **sign interval**. The relevant hypotheses are now \(H_{0}:\widetilde{\mu}=\widetilde{\mu}_{0}\)versus \(H_{\text{a}}:\widetilde{\mu}\neq\widetilde{\mu}_{0}\). Let's use the following rejection region: either \(Y\geq 15\) or \(Y\leq 5\).
* What is the significance level for this test?
* The confidence interval will consist of all values \(\widetilde{\mu}_{0}\) for which \(H_{0}\) is not rejected. Determine the CI for the given data, and state the confidence level.
* The single-factor ANOVA model considered in Chapter 11 assumed the observations in the \(i\)th sample were selected from a normal distribution with mean \(\mu_{i}\) and variance \(\sigma^{2}\), that is, \(X_{ij}=\mu_{i}+\varepsilon_{ij}\) where the \(\varepsilon\)'s are normal with mean 0 and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). The normality assumption implies that the \(F\) test is not distribution-free. We now assume that the \(\varepsilon\)'s all come from the same continuous, but not necessarily normal, distribution, and develop a distribution-free test of the null hypothesis that all \(I\)\(\mu_{i}\)'s are identical. Let \(N=\sum J_{i}\), the total number of observations in the data set (there are \(J_{i}\) observations in the \(i\)th sample). Rank these \(N\) observations from 1 (the smallest) to \(N\), and let \(\overline{R}_{i}\) be the average of the ranks for the observations in the \(i\)th sample. When \(H_{0}\) is true, we expect the rank of any particular observation and therefore also \(\overline{R}_{i}\) to be (\(N+1\))/2. The data argues against \(H_{0}\) when some of the \(\overline{R}_{i}\)'s differ considerably from (\(N+1\))/2. The _Krus-kal-Wallis_ test statistic is \[K=\frac{12}{N(N+1)}\sum J_{i}\left(\overline{R}_{i}-\frac{N+1}{2}\right)^{2}\] When \(H_{0}\) is true and either (1) \(I=3\), all \(J_{i}\geq 6\) or (2) \(I>3\), all \(J_{i}\geq 5\), the test statistic has approximately a chi-squared distribution with \(I-1\) df. The accompanying observations on axial stiffness index resulted from a study of metal-plate connected trusses in which five different plate lengths--4 in., 6 in., 8 in., 10 in., and 12 in. -- were used ("Modeling Joints Made with Light-Gauge Metal Connector Plates," _Forest Products J._, 1979: 39-44). 
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \(i=1\) (4 in.): & 309.2 & 309.7 & 311.0 & 316.8 \\ & 326.5 & 349.8 & 409.5 & \\ \(i=2\) (6 in.): & 331.0 & 347.2 & 348.9 & 361.0 \\ & 381.7 & 402.1 & 404.5 & \\ \(i=3\) (8 in.): & 351.0 & 357.1 & 366.2 & 36738. The article "Production of Gaseous Nitrogen in Human Steady-State Conditions" (_J. Appl. Physiol._, 1972: 155-159) reports the following observations on the amount of nitrogen expired (in liters) under four dietary regimens: (1) fasting, (2) 23% protein, (3) 32% protein, and (4) 67% protein. Use the Kruskal-Wallis test (Exercise 37) at level.05 to test equality of the corresponding \(\mu_{i}\)'s.
39. The model for the data from a randomized block experiment for comparing \(I\) treatments was \(X_{ij}=\mu+\alpha_{i}+\beta_{j}+\varepsilon_{ij}\), where the _a_'s are treatment effects, the _b_'s are block effects, and the _e_'s were assumed normal with mean 0 and variance \(\sigma^{2}\). We now replace normality by the assumption that the _e_'s have the same continuous distribution. A distribution-free test of the null hypothesis of no treatment effects, called _Friedman's test_, involves first ranking the observations in each block separately from 1 to \(I\). The rank average \(\overline{R}_{i}\) is then calculated for each of the \(I\) treatments. If \(H\)0 is true, the expected value of each rank average is (_I_ + 1)/2. The test statistic is

\[F_{r}=\frac{12J}{I(I+1)}\sum\left(\overline{R}_{i}-\frac{I+1}{2}\right)^{2}\]

For even moderate values of \(J\), the test statistic has approximately a chi-squared distribution with \(I\) - 1 df when \(H\)0 is true.

The article "Physiological Effects During Hypnotically Requested Emotions" (_Psychosomatic Med._, 1963: 334-343) reports the following data (\(x_{j}\)) on skin potential in millivolts when the emotions of fear, happiness, depression, and calmness were requested from each of eight subjects.
41. Suppose we wish to test \(H\)0: the \(X\) and \(Y\) distributions are identical versus _H_a: the \(X\) distribution is less spread out than the \(Y\) distribution

The accompanying figure pictures \(X\) and \(Y\) distributions for which _H_a is true. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is not appropriate in this situation because when _H_a is true as pictured, the _Y_'s will tend to be at the extreme ends of the combined sample (resulting in small and large \(Y\) ranks), so the sum of \(X\) ranks will result in a \(W\) value that is neither large nor small.

\(X\) distribution

\(Y\) distribution

\(``\)Ranks\("\) : 1 3 5 6 4 2

Consider modifying the procedure for assigning ranks as follows: After the combined sample of \(m+n\) observations is ordered, the smallest observation is given rank 1, the largest observation is given rank 2, the second smallest is given rank 3, the second largest is given rank 4, and so on. Then if \(H_{\text{a}}\) is true as pictured, the \(X\) values will tend to be in the middle of the sample and thus receive large ranks. Let \(W^{\prime}\) denote the sum of the \(X\) ranks and consider rejecting \(H_{0}\) in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\) when \(w^{\prime}\geq c\). When \(H_{0}\) is true, every possible set of \(X\) ranks has the same probability, so \(W^{\prime}\)_has the same distribution as does \(W\) when \(H_{0}\) is true_. Thus \(c\) can be chosen from Appendix Table A.13 to yield a level \(\alpha\) test. The accompanying data refers to medial muscle thickness for arterioles from the lungs of children who died from sudden infant death syndrome (\(x\)'s) and a control group of children (\(y\)'s). Carry out the test of \(H_{0}\) versus \(H_{\text{a}}\) at level.05.

* The box plot shows positive skewness. The two longest runs are extreme outliers.

* The largest observation could be decreased to 6 without affecting \(f_{s}\)

* The mean is 27.82, the median is 26, and the 5% trimmed mean is 27.38. The mean exceeds the median, in accord with positive skewness. The trimmed mean is between the mean and median, as you would expect.
* There are two outliers at the high end and one at the low end, but there are no extreme outliers. Because the median is in the lower half of the box, the upper whisker is longer than the lower whisker, and there are two high outliers compared to just one low outlier, the plot suggests positive skewness.
* The two distributions are centered in about the same place, but one machine is much more variable than the other. The more precise machine produced one outlier, but this part would not be an outlier if judged by the distribution of the other machine.
* All of the Indian salaries are below the first quartile of Yankee salaries. There is much more variability in the Yankee salaries. Neither team has any outliers.
* The three flow rates yield similar uniformities, but the values for the 160 flow rate are a little higher.

71. **a.** Mode =.93. It occurs four times in the data set. **b.** The Modal Category is the one in which the most observations occur.
73. The measures that are sensitive to outliers are the mean and the midrange. The mean is sensitive because all values are used in computing it. The midrange is the most sensitive because it uses only the most extreme values in its computation. The median, the trimmed mean, and the midfourth are less sensitive to outliers. The median is the most resistant to outliers because it uses only the middle value (or values) in its computation. The midfourth is also quite resistant because it uses the fourths. The resistance of the trimmed mean increases with the trimming percentage.

79. **a.** There may be a tendency to a repeating pattern. **b.** The value.1 gives a much smoother series. **c.** The smoothed value depends on all previous values of the time series, but the coefficient decreases with \(k\). **d.** As \(t\) gets large, the coefficient \((1-z)^{j-1}\) decreases to zero, so there is decreasing sensitivity to the initial value.

However, the plot of residuals against the fitted values shows some dependence of the variance on the mean. If logged response is used in place of response, the plots look good and the \(F\) test result is similar but stronger.

**31.**: **a.**: (.51, 1.40) **b.**: To test \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=1\) vs. \(H_{a}\): \(\beta_{1}<1\), we compute \(t=-.2258>-1.383=-t.10.9\), so there is no reason to reject the null hypothesis, even at the 10% level. There is no conflict between the data and the assertion that the slope is at least 1.
**32.**: \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=1.536\), and a 95% CI is (.632, 2.440) **b.**: Yes, for the test of \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) vs. \(H_{a}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\), we find \(t=3.62\), with \(P\)-value.0025. At the.01 level conclude that there is a useful linear relationship.
**c.**: Because 5 is beyond the range of the data, predicting at a dose of 5 might involve too much extrapolation.

4. \(\hat{\beta}_{1}=1.683\), and a 95% CI is (.531, 2.835). Eliminating the point causes only moderate change, so the point is not extremely influential.
37. **a.** Yes, for the test of \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) vs. \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\), we find \(t=-6.73\), with \(P\)-value.00002. At the.01 level conclude that there is a useful linear relationship. **b.** (\(-2.77,-1.42\))

40. **a.** The regression equation is \(y=-1.58+2.59x\) and \(R^{2}=.838\). **b.** A 95% confidence interval for the slope is ( 2.16, 3.01). In repetitions of the whole process of data collection and calculation of the interval, roughly 95% of the intervals will contain the true slope. **c.** When \(\text{tamin}=.6\) the estimated mean astringency is \(-0.0335\) and the 95% confidence interval is (\(-0.125\), 0.058) **d.** When \(\text{tamin}=.6\) the predicted astringency is \(-0.0335\) and the 95% prediction interval is \((-0.5582,0.4912)\). **e.** Our null hypothesis is that true average astringency is 0 when tannin is.7, and the alternative is that the true average is positive. The \(t\) for this test is 4.61, with \(P\)-value =.000035, so yes there is compelling evidence.
41. **a.** Yes, for the test of \(H_{0}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) vs. \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\), we find \(t=10.62\), with \(P\)-value.00014. At the.001 level conclude that there is a useful linear relationship. **b.** (8.24, 12.96) With 95% confidence, when the flow rate is increased by 1 SCCM, the associated expected change in etch rate is in the interval. **c.** (36.10, 40.41) This is fairly precise. **d.** (31.86, 44.65) This is much less precise than the interval in (c) **e.** Because 2.5 is closer to the mean, the intervals will be narrower. **f.** Because 6 is outside the range of the data, it is unknown whether the regression will apply there. **g.** Use a 99% CI at each value: (23.88, 31.43), (29.93, 35.98), (35.07, 41.45)

54. \(r=.923\), so \(x\) and \(y\) are strongly correlated. **b.** unaffected **c.** unaffected **d.** The normal plots seem consistent with normality, but the scatter plot shows a slight curvature. **e.** For the test of \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) vs. \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\rho\neq 0\), we find \(t=7.59\), with \(P\)-value.00002. At the.001 level conclude that there is a useful linear relationship.
55. **a.** For the test of \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) vs. \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\rho\neq 0\), we find \(t=.760\), \(t=4.05\), with \(P\)-value \(<.001\). At the.001 level conclude that there is a positive correlation. **b.** Because \(r^{2}=.578\) we say that the regression accounts for 57.8 % of the variation in endurance. This also applies to prediction of lactate level from endurance.
60. For the test of \(H_{0}\): \(\rho=0\) vs. \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\rho\neq 0\), we find \(t=.773\), with \(P\)-value.072. At the.05 level conclude that there is not a significant correlation. With such a small sample size, a high \(r\) is needed for significance.
61. **a.** Reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. **b.** No, with a large sample size a small \(r\) can be significant. **c.** Because \(t=2.200\geq 1.96=t_{.025,999}\) the correlation is statistically (but not necessarily practically) significant at the.05 level.
62. **a.**\(.184,-238,-426\) **b.** The mean that is subtracted is not the mean \(\bar{x}_{1,n-1}\) of \(x_{1}\), \(x_{2}\),..., \(x_{n-1}\), or the mean \(\bar{x}_{2,n}\) of \(x_{2}\), \(x_{3}\),..., \(x_{n}\). Also, the denominator of \(r_{1}\) is not \(\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}_{1,n-1}\right)^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{j=2}^ {n}\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}_{2,n}\right)^{2}}\). However, if \(n\) is large then \(r_{1}\) is approximately the same as the correlation. A similar relationship applies to \(r_{2}\). **c.** No **d.** After performing one test at the.05 level, doing more tests raises the probability of at least one type I error to more than.05.
63. The plot shows no reasons for concern about using the simple linear regression model.
71. **a.** The simple linear regression model may not be a perfect fit because the plot shows some curvature. **b.** The plot of standardized residuals is very similar to the residual plot. The normal probability plot gives no reason to doubt normality.
72. **a.** For the test of \(H_{G}\): \(\beta_{1}=0\) vs. \(H_{\alpha}\): \(\beta_{1}\neq 0\), we find \(t=10.97\), with \(P\)-value.0004. At the.001 level conclude that there is a useful linear relationship. **b.** The residual plot shows curvature, so the linear relationship of part (a) is questionable. **c.** There are no extreme standardized residuals, and the plot of standardized residuals is similar to the plot of ordinary residuals.
73. **c.** The first data set seems appropriate for a straight-line model. The second data set shows a quadratic relationship, so the straight-line relationship is inappropriate. The third data set is linear except for an outlier, and removal of the outlier will allow a line to be fit. The fourth data set has only two values of \(x\), so there is no way to tell if the relationship is linear.
74. **a.** To test for lack of fit, we find \(f=3.30\), with 3 numerator df and 10 denominator df, so the \(P\)-value is.079. At the.05 level we cannot conclude that the relationship is poor. **b.** The scatter plot shows that the relationship is not linear, in spite of (a). In this case, the plot is more sensitive than the test.
75. **a.** 77.3 **b.** 40.4 **c.** The coefficient \(\beta_{3}\) is the difference in sales caused by the window, all other things being equal.

13. If \(p_{ij}\) denotes the probability of a type \(j\) response when treatment \(i\) is applied, then \(H_{0}\): \(\text{p}_{ij}=\text{p}_{2j}=\text{p}_{3j}=\text{p}_{2j}\) for \(j=1\), 2, 3, 4. With \(\chi^{2}=27.66\geq 23.587=\chi_{.005,9}\), reject \(H_{0}\) at the.005 level. The treatment does affect the response.
14. With \(\chi^{2}=64.65\geq 13.277=\chi^{2}_{.01,4}\), reject \(H_{0}\) at the.001 level. Political views are related to marijuana usage. In particular, liberals are more likely to be users.
15. Compute the expected counts by \(\hat{e}_{i\beta\epsilon}=n\hat{p}_{i\beta\epsilon}=n\hat{p}_{i}.\hat{p}_{j}. \hat{p}_{\lambda\epsilon}=n\frac{n_{i}.}{n}\frac{n_{j}.}{n}\frac{n_{j}.}{n}\). For the \(\chi^{2}\) statistic \(\text{df}=20\).
16. **a.** With \(\chi^{2}=.681\leq 4.605=\chi^{2}_{.10,2}\), do not reject independence at the.10 level. **b.** With \(\chi^{2}=6.81\geq 4.605=\chi^{2}_{.10,2}\), reject independence at the.10 level.
17. **c.** 677
18. With \(\chi^{2}=6.45\) and \(P\)-value.040, reject independence at the.05 level.
19. With \(z=-2.29\) and \(P\)-value.022, reject independence at the.05 level.

* Because the logistic regression takes into account the order in the professorial ranks, it should be more sensitive, so it should give a lower _P_-value.
* There are few female professors but many assistant professors, and the assistant professors will be the professors of the future.
37. With \(\chi^{2}=13.005\geq 9.210=\chi^{2}_{01,2}\), reject the null hypothesis of no effect at the.01 level. Oil does make a difference (more parasites).
38. \(H_{0}\): The population proportion of Late Game Leader Wins is the same for all four sports; \(H_{\text{a}}\): The proportion of Late Game Leader Wins is not the same for all four sports. With \(\chi^{2}=10.518\geq 7.815=\chi^{2}_{.05,3}\), reject the null hypothesis at level.05. Sports differ in terms of coming from behind late in the game. * Yes (baseball)
40. With \(\chi^{2}=197.6\geq 16.812=\chi^{2}_{.01,6}\), reject the null hypothesis at the.01 level. The aged are more likely to die in a chronic-care facility.
41. With \(\chi^{2}=.763<7.779=\chi^{2}_{.10,4}\), do not reject the hypothesis of independence at the.10 level. There is no evidence that age influences the need for item pricing.
42. \(\mathbf{a}\). No, \(\chi^{2}=9.02\geq 7.815=\chi^{2}_{.05,3}\). * With \(\chi^{2}=.157<6.251=\chi^{2}_{.10,3}\), there is no reason to say the model does not fit.
43. \(H_{0}\): \(p_{0}=p_{1}=\ldots=p_{3}=.10\) vs. \(H_{\text{a}}\): at least one \(p_{i}\neq.10\), with df = 9. * \(H_{0}\): \(p_{ij}=.01\) for \(i\) and \(j=0,1,2,\ldots,9\) vs. \(H_{\text{a}}\): at least one \(p_{ij}\neq.01\), with df = 99. * No, there must be more observations than cells to do a valid chi-square test. * The results give no reason to reject randomness.

## Chapter 14

* For a two-tailed test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=100\) at level.05, we find that \(s_{+}=27\) and because \(14<s_{+}<64\), we do not reject \(H_{0}\).
* For a two-tailed test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=7.39\) at level.05, we find that \(s_{+}=18\) and because \(s_{+}\) does not satisfy \(21<s_{+}<84\), we reject \(H_{0}\).
* We form the difference and perform a two-tailed test of \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=0\) at level.05. This gives \(s_{+}=72\) and because it does not satisfy \(14<s_{+}<64\), we reject \(H_{0}\) at the.05 level.
* Because \(s_{+}=162.5\) with _P_-value.044, reject \(H_{0}\): \(\mu=75\) in favor of \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu>75\) at the.05 level.
* With \(w=38\), reject \(H_{0}\) at the.05 level because the rejection region is \(\{w\geq 36\}\).
* Test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=1\) vs. \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}>1\). After subtracting 1 from the original process measurements, we get \(w=65\). Do not reject \(H_{0}\) because \(w<84\).
* \(\mathbf{b}\). Test \(H_{0}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}=0\) vs. \(H_{\text{a}}\): \(\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}<0\). With a _P_-value of.002 we reject \(H_{0}\) at the.01 level.
* With \(w=135\), \(z=2.223\), and the approximate _P_-value is.026, so we would not reject the null hypothesis at the.01 level.
* (11.15, 23.80)
* (\(-.585\),.025)
* (16, 87)
* \(\mathbf{a}\). (.4736\(,.6669\))
* For a two-tailed test at level.05, we find that \(s_{+}=24\) and because \(4<s_{+}<32\), we do not reject the hypothesis of equal means.
* \(\mathbf{a}\). \(\alpha=.0207\); Bin(20,.5)
* \(c=14\); because \(y=12\), do not reject \(H_{0}\)
* With \(K=20.12\geq 13.277=\chi^{2}_{.01,4}\), reject the null hypothesis of equal means at the 1% level. Axial strength does seem to (as an increasing function) depend on plate length.
* Because \(f_{r}=6.45<7.815=\chi^{2}_{.05,3}\), do not reject the null hypothesis of equal emotion means at the 5% level.
* Because \(w^{\prime}=26<27\), do not reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level.
