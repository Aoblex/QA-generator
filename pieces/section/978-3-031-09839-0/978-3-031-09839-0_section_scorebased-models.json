        "content": "Title: Score-Based Models\nContent: For some types of forensic evidence, the specification of a probability model for available data may be difficult. This is the case, for example, when the measurements are obtained using high-dimensional quantification techniques, e.g., for fingermarks or toolmarks (using complex sets of variables), in speaker recognition, or for traces such as glass, drugs or toxic substances that may be described by several chemical components. In such applications, a _feature-based_ Bayes factor (Sect. 1.5.1) may not be feasible, and a _score-based_ approach may represent a practicable (or even the only) available alternative. Broadly speaking, a score is a metric that summarizes the result of a forensic comparison of two items or traces, in terms of a single variable, representing a measure of similarity or difference (e.g., distance). Various distance measures can be used, such as _Euclidean_ or _Manhattan_ distance, see, e.g., Bolck et al. (2015).14 One of the first proposals of score-based approaches in forensic science was presented in the context of forensic speaker recognition by Meuwly (2001).\n\nFootnote 14: The score can also be interpreted as the inner product of two vectors (Neumann & Ausdemore, 2020).\n\nLet \\(\\Delta(\\cdot)\\) denote the function which assesses the degree of similarity between feature vectors \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The _similarity score_\\(\\Delta(x,y)\\) represents the evidence for which a Bayes factor is to be computed. The introduction of a score function for quantifying the similarities/dissimilarities between compared items allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, while retaining the discriminative information as much as possible. For a score given by a distance, for example, one will expect a value close to zero if the features \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) relate to items from the same source. Vice versa, if the features \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) relate to items from different sources, one will expect a larger score, provided that there are differences between members in a population. The score-based Bayes factor (sBF) is\n\n\\[\\mathrm{sBF}\\;=\\;\\frac{g(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid H_{1},\\,I)}{g(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid H_{2}, \\,I)}, \\tag{1.24}\\]\n\nwhere \\(g(\\cdot)\\) denotes the probability distribution associated with \\(\\Delta(X,Y)\\). For the sake of simplicity, the conditioning information \\(I\\) will be omitted hereafter.\n\nFor the Bayes factor in (1.24), one cannot reproduce the simplified expression that was derived in (1.16) for the feature-based Bayes factor. The score-based Bayes factor must be computed as the ratio of two probability density functions evaluated at the evidence score \\(\\Delta(x,y)\\), given the competing propositions \\(H_{1}\\) and \\(H_{2}\\). Since these two distributions are not generally available by default, the forensic examiner will generally try to derive a sBF using sampling distributions based on many scores produced under each of the two competing propositions. One way to compute the density of the score \\(\\Delta(x,y)\\) in the numerator is to generate many scores for comparisons between the known features \\(x\\) and the features \\(y\\) of other items known to come from the potential source assumed under \\(H_{1}\\). The numerator can therefore be written as \\(\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid x,H_{1})\\), where \\(\\hat{g}(\\cdot)\\) indicates that the distribution is constructed on the basis of relevant data (scores) produced for the case of interest.\n\nIn the denominator, it is assumed that the proposition \\(H_{2}\\) is true, and \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) denote features of items that come from different sources. The challenge for the forensic examiner is that of selecting the most appropriate data for obtaining the distribution in the denominator. Note that there are different ways to address this question because, depending on the case at hand, it might be appropriate to condition on (i) the known source (i.e., pursuing a so-called _source-anchored_ approach), (ii) the trace (i.e., _trace-anchored_ approach), or (iii) none of these (i.e., _non-anchored_ approach). This amounts to evaluating the score using the probability density distribution that is obtained by producing scores for comparisons between (i) the features \\(x\\) of the control item from the known source and features of items taken from randomly selected sources of the relevant population, (ii) the features \\(y\\) of the trace item and features of items taken from sources selected randomly in the relevant population, (iii) features of pairs of items taken from sources selected randomly in the relevant population (i.e., without using \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)). Formally, this amounts to defining the distribution in the denominator as follows:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{ll}\\mbox{(i)}&\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid x,\\,H_{2}),\\\\ \\mbox{(ii)}&\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid y,\\,H_{2}),\\\\ \\mbox{(iii)}&\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid H_{2}).\\end{array}\\]\n\nSee, e.g., Hepler et al. (2012) for a discussion of this topic.\n\nExample 1.3 (Image Comparison): Consider a hypothetical case where the face of an individual is captured by surveillance cameras during the commission of a crime. Available screenshots are compared with the reference image(s) of a person of interest. For image comparison purposes, the evidence to be considered is a score given by the distance between the feature vectors \\(x\\) of the known reference and the evidential recording \\(y\\) (see Jacquet and Champod (2020) for a review). Consider the following competing propositions. \\(H_{1}\\): The person of interest is the individual shown in the images of the surveillance camera, versus \\(H_{2}\\): An unknown person is depicted in the image of the surveillance camera. To help specify the probability distribution of the score in the numerator, one can take several pairs of images from the person of interest to serve as pairs of questioned and reference items. To inform the probability distribution for the score in the denominator, conditioning on the reference item \\(x\\) (i.e., the images depicting the person of interest) can be justified as it may contain information that is relevant to the case and may be helpful for generating scores (Jacquet and Champod, 2020; Hepler et al., 2012). The distribution in the denominator can thus be computed using a _source-anchored_ approach as in (i). The sBF can therefore be obtained as \n\n**Example 1.3** (continued): \\[\\mathrm{sBF}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid x,\\,H_{1})}{\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y) \\mid x,\\,H_{2})}.\\]\n\nIn other types of forensic cases, conditioning on \\(y\\) in the denominator, case (ii), may be more appropriate. This represents an asymmetric approach to defining the distribution in the numerator and in the denominator.\n\n**Example 1.4** (Handwritten Documents): _Consider a case involving handwriting on a questioned document. Handwriting features \\(y\\) on the questioned document are compared to the handwriting features \\(x\\) of a person of interest. The similarities and differences between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are measured by a suitable metric (score). To inform about the probability distribution of the scores in the numerator, one can take several draws of pairs of handwritten characters originating from the known source to serve as recovered and control items and to obtain scores from the selected draws. Under \\(H_{2}\\), consideration of \\(x\\) is not relevant for the assessment. Note that here \\(H_{2}\\) is the proposition according to which the person of interest is not the source of the handwriting on the questioned document, but someone else from the relevant population. It would then seem reasonable to construct the distribution for the denominator by comparing the features \\(y\\) of the questioned document with features \\(x\\) from items of handwriting of persons randomly selected from the relevant population of potential writers. This amounts to a trace-anchored approach as in situation (ii) defined above. In fact, for handwriting, the approach (i) would amount to discarding relevant information related to the questioned document. The sBF can therefore be obtained as_\n\n\\[\\mathrm{sBF}\\;=\\;\\frac{\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid x,\\,H_{1})}{\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y) \\mid y,\\,H_{2})}.\\]\n\nIn yet other cases, the distribution in the denominator may be obtained by comparing pairs of items drawn randomly from the relevant population, without conditioning on either \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). In such cases, the alternative proposition \\(H_{2}\\) is that the two compared items come from different sources.\n\nExample 5 (Firearm Examination): Consider a case in which a bullet is found at a crime scene and a person carrying a gun is arrested. The extent of agreement between marks left by firearms on bullets can be summarized by a score or multiple scores. An example of a simple score is the concept of consecutive matching striations. To inform the distribution in the numerator, the scientist fires multiple bullets using the seized firearm. To inform the distribution in the denominator, the scientist fires and compares many bullets known to come from different guns (i.e., different relevant models). The distribution in the denominator can thus be computed using a _non-anchored_ approach. The sBF can therefore be obtained as\n\n\\[\\text{sBF}=\\frac{\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid x,\\,H_{1})}{\\hat{g}(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid H_ {2})}.\\]\n\nNote that this is a coarse approach in the sense that no consideration is given to general manufacturing features. Indeed, the amount and quality of striation on a bullet may depend on aspects such as the caliber and the composition (e.g., jacketed/non-jacketed bullets, etc.), hence a conditioning on y may be considered.\n\nAnother example for a non-anchored approach, in the context of fingermark comparison, can be found in Leegwater et al. (2017). An example will be presented in Sect. 3.3.4.\n\nNote that the above considerations refer to so-called _specific-source_ cases. In such cases, recovered material is compared to material from a known source. However, there are also other situations where the competing propositions are as follows:\n\n\\(H_{1}\\): The recovered and the control material originate from the _same_ source.\n\n\\(H_{2}\\): The recovered and the control material originate from _different_ sources.\n\nFor such _common-source_ propositions, the sampling distributions under the competing propositions can be learned, under \\(H_{1}\\), from many scores for known same-source pairs (with each pair drawn from a distinct source) and, under (\\(H_{2}\\)), from many scores for pairs known to come from different sources. The score-based BF in this case will account for the occurrence of the observed score under the competing propositions, but it does not account for the rarity of the characteristics of the trace.\n\nWhile a score-based approach has the potential to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, the use of scores implies a loss of information because features \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are replaced by a single score. Therefore, there is a trade-off to be found between the complexity of the original configuration of features and the performance of the score-metric, the choice of which requires a justification.\n\nFor a critical discussion of score-based evaluative metrics, see Neumann (2020) and Neumann and Ausdemore (2020). See also Bolck et al. (2015) for a discussion of feature- and score-based approaches for multivariate data."

        "raw_response": "问题1: 什么是基于分数的贝叶斯因子，如何计算它？\n答: 基于分数的贝叶斯因子（sBF）是用于在法庭科学中比较两项或迹象的方法。它是由两个贝叶斯因子比率组成，分子部分是在假设\\(H_{1}\\)成立的情况下手动计算的得分概率密度函数，分母部分则根据\\(H_{2}\\)假设进行计算。具体地，sBF的计算方式如下：\n\n\\[\\mathrm{sBF}\\;=\\;\\frac{g(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid H_{1})}{g(\\Delta(x,y)\\mid H_{2})},\\]\n\n其中\\(g(\\cdot)\\)表示与\\(\\Delta(x,y)\\)相关的概率分布函数。在实际操作中，由于这两个分布通常不是默认可用的，法庭上的检验员通常会借助基于每个假设下产生的许多分数得出这些密度曲线。这意味着在计算sBF时，需要基于已知数据生成用于分子和分母计算的概率密度函数，并从中获取分布的信息。\n\n问题2: 在案例分析中，为什么在特定案例中选择了源锚定、迹锚定或不锚定的方法来计算得分的概率分布？\n答: 在案例研究中，选择源锚定、迹锚定或不锚定方法计算概率分布是为了根据具体的法医情景选择最合适的数据对sBF进行计算。这种选择取决于个案的特定要求和因素。例如，在人脸图像对比情景中，选择源锚定方法是因为已知图像可能包含关于案件相关信息；在手写文件对比中，选择迹锚定方法是因为嫌疑人手写特征对案件的相关性；而在枪支检验中，选择不锚定方法是因为要考虑到不同枪支的普通特征而非具体案件的特定要求。\n\n问题3: 基于分数的贝叶斯因子如何应对“特定来源”和“共同来源”的法庭科学情境？\n答: 对于“特定来源”情境，根据假设\\(H_{1}\\)，从已知相同来源的对比数据中产生许多分数，而根据假设\\(H_{2}\\)，从已知不同来源的对比数据中产生许多分数。得出的sBF反映了在两种假设下观察到的得分发生的概率；但它并不反映迹象特征的稀有程度。对于“共同来源”情境，采样分布分别由来自不同来源和相同来源的对比数据计算得出。\n\n问题4: 在案例1.3中，如果手动实验无法获得足够多的对比数据，该如何解决？\n答: 如果手动实验无法获得足够多的对比数据，那么可以利用其他来源的数据，比如公开的数据集或者同行研究中使用的数据，来帮助构建概率密度函数。此外，也可以考虑使用模拟生成的数据来辅助构建概率密度函数。\n\n问题5: 基于案例5中的火器检验，sBF如何帮助判断子弹来自于被捕捉的枪支？\n答: 在火器检验中，sBF可以通过比较在被捕捉的枪支发射的子弹和来自不同枪支的子弹的多个得分来判断它们之间的相似程度。通过计算sBF，可以辅助法医鉴定员判断捕捉到的子弹是否来自于特定枪支。\n\n问题6: 为什么在判别特定来源和共同来源时，需要考虑特征得分的稀有程度？\n答: 在判断特定来源和共同来源时，需要考虑特征得分的稀有程度，因为sBF虽然可以反映得分在不同假设下的发生概率，但却无法反映迹象特征的稀有程度。这一点在判断迹象是否来源于特定个体或群体时至关重要。\n\n问题7: 在案例1.4中，为什么对迹锚定方法的可取性进行了特别强调？\n答: 在案例1.4中，对迹锚定方法的可取性进行了特别强调，是因为在手写文件对比中，来自于可疑文件的手写特征与来自于不同潜在写者的手写特征进行对比时，这种方法可以更好地反映出案件的相关信息，有利于sBF的准确计算。\n\n问题8: 从统计学角度来看，分数的使用在法庭科学中有哪种是潜在的缺点？\n答: 从统计学角度来看，分数的使用会导致信息的丢失，因为特征\\(y\\)和\\(x\\)被替换为单个得分。这可能会使得到的评估结果更具误导性。此外，选择适当的得分度量和评估度量的复杂性也可能导致一定程度的问题。\n\n问题9: 如何评价分数的使用对因贝斯因子计算的影响？\n答: 分数的使用虽然有助于降低问题的维度，却也会意味着信息的丢失。因此，在选择使用分数时，需要考虑到原始特征的复杂配置和分数度量的性能，从而找到一个合理的平衡点。\n\n问题10: 如何解决因贝叶斯因子计算中分数引起的信息丢失问题？\n答: 要解决因贝叶斯因子计算中分数引起的信息丢失问题，需要对特征的选择和得分度量的选择进行充分的论证。此外，也需要考虑到分数计算的复杂性和误导性，并尽量避免信息的丢失。"
